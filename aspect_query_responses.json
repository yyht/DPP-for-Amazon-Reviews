Our previous laptop was a tobisha and I wish now I had purchased a new tobisha instead The battery life on this machine is disgusting.","Out of all the laptops I have owned the toshiba a215 s4747 has been the best especially at the price I have payed for it, not to mention that it has a built in webcam and mic, the keyboard is silver so it is easy to see in the dark with the glow of the screen.","First of all, what this laptop does well.","Many HP TX Series laptop have been going out and HP hasn\u0027t taken steps to help the customers.This laptop is for: If you are looking for an over priced laptop that will work for a year and a half this is for you.This laptop is NOT for: If you are looking for a dependable laptop that will last a while.PS.","I am a computer tech and have literally set up thousands of brand new and different laptops for a retail store over the course of a year, and I will tell you that this is the best monitor I have ever seen hands down.","I would recommend this to a friend or my mom!! It Is a Awesome Laptop But Don\u0027t Let The Description fool You Like It Did Me And Others.","Now they will be only memories because I will never again buy an HP laptop.","I am what they call a \u0027heavy\u0027 user that runs multiple applications, databases and servers simultaneously on a laptop all the time and I have not been disappointed by this laptop.Aside from a fast processor and the IBM/Lenovo reliability the features that made me choose this laptop over all others (including Dell and Sony) are:Keyboard: the keyboard bed on this laptop is strong, on other laptops if you push down a key the keyboard depresses and bends, not on this laptopBattery life: I installed an extra battery pack and it lasts a full 2.5 hoursWireless Reception: the reception on this laptop is much better than on any Dell that I have used.","It plays movies great, however if you are buying a laptop for the sole purpose of watching DVD movies, look for a model with more video memory.","I have spent over $200 still with no success for just 1 of the laptops.","The laptop was initially a bit slow, but after some adjustments like removing crappy Norton Anti Virus, disabling the defragmenting every time the laptop was turned on etc it was better.","I bought more expensive laptop units in the past and and all pale in comparison with my MBA.","I had to get a \"bootlegged\" copy of Windows XP even though I paid for the Windows that came with the laptop.","The superdrive can get a little loud at times, battery life isnt the greatest, but the worst thing i have found is that the laptop get extremely hot after extended use.","The other reason is that this laptop has a lot of connnectivity.","It runs smoothly and manages all the tasks I need; after my little 10\" Vaio which has served me many years, the screen looks more than generous, and yet this laptop weighs surprisingly little.","Pros: Nice screen, nice hardware configuration ie...CPU, RAM, HD etc....stylish look, light weight, DVD Burner, keybooardCons: These are more of what I would like to see in a laptop so its just not this one specific...no video out connection for TV, no infrared or bluetooth, integrated video, priceOverall this is a nice laptop.","It\u0027s probably the best laptop boasting a 3ghz CPU and DVD-RW capability.","They don\u0027t offer replacements...only an \"I\u0027m sorry.\"Back to Dell we go! Our second laptop, and this rocks over last year\u0027s Toshiba.","This is my first and only laptop thus far.","the laptop runs hot.","Had lots of compliments already and I also purchased a laptop sleeve by ISIS DEI to go wit hit.I read the reviews on the specs before my purchase and the only thing I regret is that I waited so long to finally get it.","I also use it for checking emails and some light surfing, although I rather surf on my laptop due to the small screen.","So I got the laptop and its a good thing I double checked everything before I gave it to my sis (she needed something she could take to school with her for minor projects and such) because it came with what must have been a different laptops charger.","Now what gives -- I\u0027m plugged into electricity and now another half hour later I\u0027m down to about 6 minutes battery life and the laptop dies.","I finally was able to ship the unit to HP for repair, three weeks after logging the first service call I receive a still broken laptop back from HP.","First a disclaimer - I am Sony fan, so with everything in my life (Clie, camera, Camcorder, etc.) takes memory sticks and whatnot, I am almost locked into buying a Sony Laptop.I got this laptop as a replacement to my PCG-GRZ630, which was a pile of steaming crap - literally.","The only negative I can really find is that my computer was expensive compared to WINTEL laptops, but I definitely think that it was worth the price.","Come out of sleep mode, and how long does it take to connect to your WiFi network?

The heat vent is on the left side of the laptop, which is GREAT for all the right-handers out there that use an external mouse.","My carrying case is a multi-function style design where I can hoist it on my shoulder or flip out the backstrap and turn into a backpack.There were other laptops that I compared to this one and the only one under (at the time) US$2,000.00 was the Toshiba Satellite 1905-S303.","I\u0027ll take it back to Circuit City and use their warranty (I\u0027ve gotten mixed messages about when it kicks in-during the first year or after it\u0027s over.).Overall, it\u0027s a great laptop for a stupendous price.","I bought a 500 MHz ibook.While it\u0027s true that the 10 GB model does fill up rather quickly - be realistic - a laptop is a toy, unless you\u0027re truly using it as a total desktop replacement.","This is the finest computer, laptop or tower, that I have ever used.","The ports are now no nonsense... no covers to flip open or remember to close.Bottom line if you are looking for a \u0027multimedia\u0027 laptop powerhouse with decent battery time and the latest features at a resonable price... this one works.","But do you want to take the chance? I would have liked to keep this PC.Update: A friend asked me to fix a problem with hibernation on her Toshiba laptop (a different model), and Toshiba tech support told me that I needed to reload Windows from the recovery CDs that came with the unit, which I did (ticket 1-718056769).",":(- The battery is slightly loose, and when you\u0027re carrying the laptop it feels as if it is very fragile.- Although the harddisk is advertised as 100 GB, it shows around high 80s.","Until this time, I agreed that it was a good laptop that simply required adding more RAM to properly run XP.","The guy told me to charge the laptop for 12 hours, even though I kept telling him no lights turn on at all.","Lenovo has taken what was a superior brand/laptop company and cheapened it beyond recognition.","The Thinkpads are easy to set-up, makes it easy to transfer your files and settings to the new laptop, and is durable for travel.This is my 6th Thinkpad and I bought this one for business travel, but also use it as my home pc.","But I did have to look really hard for a laptop case, which Sony doesn\u0027t make!All in all, I love the computer.","It is a low end laptop which means the graphics card won\u0027t run the Battlefield series of games and may not run some of the other I don\u0027t know because I don\u0027t those type of games on it.","I only hurts your ears.Overall, this is a solid laptop that is capable of running a more advanced version of Windows Vista.","I had quite a few issues running Virtual PC on other systems with XP Home, but this laptop just runs it without any hassle.If you do need to do a clean install, check out the Sony support as it gives explicit instructions and the order of installing the various drivers.8) Built in camera and microphone - These feature are useless for me as I have no need for them.","AND - they have great customer service! When I forgot my password on my first laptop I got from them - they helped me fix it for free.","It\u0027s really an amazing step up from anything I\u0027ve owned before.The wireless pulls down signals much more strongly than any laptop I\u0027ve used before (my previous laptops were top-of-the-line Dells), and the screen is big and bright with deep, rich colors.DVD viewing and multimedia files are pretty phenomenal on this machine, as well.If you\u0027re in the market for a laptop, it honestly doesn\u0027t get any better than this.","Now we are waiting screen replacement.This laptop is very good, I give it only 4 stars because of the lemon I\u0027ve got.","If I had it to do again, however, I might choose to buy a P4 because the Athalon still tends to run a little hot, although I haven\u0027t had a problem with it running _too_ hot.This laptop is fine for watching DVD\u0027s, and I\u0027ve been able to do all of my work on it (including some image-analysis work), but it\u0027s not a good machine for gaming because the 64 MB video memory is shared memory.","The drive is 60 or 80GB, (don\u0027t recall just now), if you split it into two drives, and install your programs and important data on the second one, you can re-install windows as many times as you like without fear of data loss.Once more, i\u0027ve used this laptop during my DEPLOYMENT, and let me tell you, sand and dirt get into everything, each day I blow out a good two or three tablespoons of dust and what not, (using compressed air).","I\u0027ve had it since March, actually, and still use it on a daily basis.Speed is pretty much average now and this device is comparable to sub $1000 laptops on the market right now.","I\u0027ve had this laptop for almost three years and have never experienced any of the problems mentioned in any of the other reviews.The only negative thing that I can think to say about this laptop is that it\u0027s bulky.I still have the original lithium battery and unplugged, it lasts a bit less than an hour, but I\u0027m not unrealistic about battery performance.I occasionally wish that I had a bit more RAM, but that\u0027s when I\u0027m deep into processing very large files via Photoshop CS2 and Adobe Bridge.","If you\u0027re at all not, I don\u0027t recommend this laptop for you, because there were many times where I just wanted to throw this laptop out my dorm window.","It works GREAT!!!!!!! After doing some surfing, viewing a dvd, working on a Office document or editing some family photos, the laptop stays almost as cool as if I just started it! I certainly recomend buying both at once, specialy if you will use it on your lap and even if you are using it on a desk as I am.I would also recomend getting 256MB more of RAM, you can never have too much and it will probably make the laptop faster and cooler.Part II (16th July 2005)Six-seven months now, and I certainly love this toy.","This may be annoying to persons like me because I for example took the battery off my Toshiba laptop, I don\u0027t need it for use at home.","So I run the cpu at a lower speed to reduce the heat.My second complaint is that Acer says the laptop is \"Windows Vista Premium Ready\" but the hard drive is formatted as FAT32 which means you have to first convert the hard drive from FAT32 to NTFS before you can install Windows Vista.My third complaint is that Acer America still does not have the drivers nor their applications available for Windows Vista.","I got this laptop 7 or 8 years ago.","This laptop is significantly smaller \u0026amp; lighter.","I lost all my data and I had nowhere to go..I repaired the laptop myself..","I would be better to have power plug behind the laptop not at the right rear end which makes it hassle to move.","Get it if you need an inexpensive laptop.","Sony really needs to take a lesson from Dell and offer greater warranty coverage, especially for laptops, which tend to be more fragile and abused.In all, I think this computer is a great value for the money, particularly if you want something small and powerful with which to do music downloading and sharing.","Compared to other laptops in this class, like the DELL XPS 1210, this laptop is lighter, thinner, has a bigger screen (13.3 inches compared to 12.1 inches for the DELL) and looks much better too.","I\u0027ve had this laptop for ten months now and have had no problems.","I just bought this laptop yesterday from Circuit city, and it is beautiful.The only reason I\u0027vnt given it 5 stars is because out of the 512Mb DDR Ram, 64Mb is used for the Video Card, which I wasn\u0027t expecting and haven\u0027t seen it clearly stated anywhere.","I spoke with them today, and they have called Toshiba to declare the laptop a lemon, only to be told that just because nothing they do (by now they have also replaced the battery) can cause the thing to keep its charge over 90 minutes doesn\u0027t make it a lemon.","It has an incredable 1280 X 800 screen resolution, and the glossy display is so good that you can see it from accross the room or at an angle; try that with a laptop PC and I guaruntee you\u0027ll get a glare.The MacBook is also amazingly portable.","My current, 2+ year old T60 is no longer an IBM, it\u0027s a Lenovo - IBM sold its laptop-making division to this Chinese company.","(In fact, it wouldn\u0027t do it back in 2002, when it was an above-average laptop), but it\u0027s efficient, well made, very sturdy (it can handle the errant fall.","I love my laptop.","Repair is awful...got my laptop back in 2 weeks even though I paid for overnight return.","I absolutely LOVED this laptop.","Needless to say it was fried so I was in the market for a new laptop.","I was thrilled to buy this laptop over a year and a half ago.","This is a known problem with the LAN-Express AS 802.11g component that is used (check a google search for sony laptop intermittent wireless failure) in the machinebut Sony will not acknowledge that there is a problem.","I know not every program is up to date to run on Intel chip but why spend $2000 when you know your laptop cannot reach ful potential (and OSX leopard is on its way too!

I just adore this laptop! I am a recent convert to Mac and treated myself to the 17 inch MacBook Pro when I first opened my small business earlier this year.","I can buy a basic but pretty nice laptop for $800, so I don\u0027t see any point in throwing good money after bad.","Even though some may argue that you can get a laptop with the same specs for $200 cheaper, what you are giving up is the best OS around, which is what really makes Apple computers a level above the competitors.","This computer is byfar the BEST laptop I\u0027ve ever had.","The Latitude series is the professional series of laptops by Dell enjoying longer warranty, extended service life cycles (meaning models arent phased out as quickly).","Even though the TR series of sub-subnotebooks from Sony is now discontinued, it still sports modern-day

night and I leave it on all day.","I recently bought this laptop from Best Buy.","Let\u0027s start this off by saying I received this laptop from a relative for free so my review might be biased a little.","The entire laptop is white, crisp white (a mixed blessing...it\u0027s elegant, but very, very hard not to dirty it), and the overall design is great.","The touchpad buttons need a little *extra* force or maybe its just me...not sure but overall i really liked the laptop and its a grab for the price.","The Firefox browser also hanged randomly and that would cause the Task Manager to also stop resoponding for a minute , before i could kill the firefox process.So Please be aware when you purchase this laptop.","I am kinda glad the stupid burglars stole my old laptop...I didn\u0027t know what I was missing.","The reason why i haven\u0027t given it a five star review is that toshiba will probably never release an updated video card driver for the geforce fx 5200 that is part of this laptop.","My review is just a FYI to say newer 15\" laptops may be coming out in Nov with 10% increase in CPU speed and graphics chip.I have to see about returning mine...just got it last week.","The other thing is that the little pads on the bottom of the laptop that cushion it when sitting on a desk can come off easily.","However, it works great on my home network so I can\u0027t complain too badly.Seriously, its not that bad of a laptop.","Point is, buy this computer if you dont use a laptop for much or want a simple affordable laptop to just layback and skim through your

had no trouble.","Cronic heat related problems with Laptop shutting down after a few minutes of use.","There\u0027s nothing I don\u0027t like about this laptop so far (I\u0027ve had it for a month).","It is a pretty decent laptop for basic use for spreadsheets, word processing, and other low memeory using software.Pros:- Good deal for the money.- 2.4 Ghz processor.- Good memory upgrade.- 40 GB IDE Hard Drive.- High speed internet card.Cons:- The battery charge does last very long.- The video card has only 32 MB of built in RAM on the motherboard.","I like my MacBook overall, but Apple has GOT to be kidding about putting a 13\" screen on a laptop this expensive!Most PC laptops have 15\" screens on them these days, even many cheap $600 ones do.","They invite me to send in my laptop for a month but I can\u0027t do without it for a month.","I bought this laptop in November 2008.","This software got a simulation view which will show you when your laptop is getting shock or tilting and when it is protected..Good one.ThinkVantage-all softwares Rescue \u0026 recovery,Pc-Doctor at this point,Check this one at IBM.com.This thing weighs 4.76 pounds as specified,I feel that this should be pretty easy to carry around.Includes a 7-cell standard Lithion battery comes on a avg. of 4 hours(approxi.),cons:512 MB Memory,despite the fact it expensive,they gave me a mere 512 MB RAM,(Neverthless I have added an 1GB additional Memory-Runs Amazing )Overall I feel this is a really amazing laptop,might take you sometime to get this one as lenovo has issues with orders (I mean It took me 6 weeks to get this one),But its worth it.Highly recomended for heavy users who are looking for almost perfect laptop I got this laptop and have been playing around for a whole day now.","I liked the look of the laptop because it addresses style and it also had all the specifications I was looking for.","I bought this laptop in Apr, 2003 for College.","The laptop was still relatively new and performed well with games such as WOW and Runescape.","Hope this review was helpful I have had this on three trips now and it is hands down the best laptop for mobile professionals who require a workstation for complex software.","It\u0027s been the best purchase I\u0027ve made in quite awhile.The laptop has 2Gb of RAM, which is exceptional for a laptop at this price.","The laptop is very well constructed and sturdy.","Most laptops with CD-RW and DVD drives have either a combo drive, or you have the swap the CD-RW and DVD drives in and out of the same bay.","I have had very good luck with it, and I am on it all the time!!I have had to replace one battery, which was covered under my extended warranty, and it is in the shop right now, because I believe the wireless card has gone out in it.I really couldn\u0027t be more pleased with a laptop! We have had several Emachine Desk tops and have been equally please with them.I have had several friends buy an Emachine laptop with my recomendation!! We all LOVE them!!Kathy I have had my Gateway MX7120 for a little over a year and I love it.","Buy this little fine laptop with Toshiba and you too might move away from a Dell.Enjoy.","The fact that they want to sell me a recovery CD for a laptop I paid $1500 for pisses me off.","My business depends on having a reliable laptop for travel.","The Powerbooks are a better choice for power-users, but Apple needs to bring the G5 to their laptop line soon.","The laptop is so small that can fit into my fashional hand bag.","I stumbled across this page looking for other information about this laptop, and was surprised to see all of the one star ratings.","It takes about 6 minutes to boot, 1 minute to shut down, 90 seconds to open ITunes, 30 seconds to open Firefox browser, 15 seconds to open a file, and it hangs up constantly!If anyone knows why, I\u0027d like to find out.This is my first Vista, although my 9th laptop, and I own another 20 desktops.","In my opinion, to get something this wonderful for this price is certainly worth the rebate hassle!

It\u0027s really sort of nuisance especially for a frequent user like me, and has to find some space to house this device!Mind you, the location had to be on the left of the laptop, as the connection cord is far too short for you to place the drive else where, but still too long for placing the drive comfortably next to my laptop.","the only thing i can complain about is that 10 GB is not enough! i\u0027ve already run out of space! I must say that this is the only laptop currently on the market that I find acceptable for my needs.","I have owened a couple t60 and t61 laptops in the past and personnaly this is the worse screen out of them all.","If I had known this was going to happen I would have back in March when the issues started cropping up.I really loved it when it worked, but I feel like I\u0027ve paid a heck of a lot of money for a short-lived laptop.","I have played FEAR and Doom 3 at 1024x768 with no problems, and I can play Rise of Legends at the full resolution of the laptop.The battery life has been around 2hrs or so, which is great for a laptop with this performance.","I owned this laptop for over a year.","I recently purchased this beautiful machine on discount at CompUSA and I knew this was the laptop that I was looking for.This laptop is truly a DESKTOP REPLACEMENT (don\u0027t look for battery life to be stellar) with jaw-dropping specs even for a desktop (except for the graphics which seem a little undersized with a FX Go5200 64MB).","Laptop becomes very hot if used for more than 15-20 mins.","More than 4 hours EASY!!!

I got this laptop because my dad\u0027s friend who is a computer programmer was getting this same laptop.","We\u0027ve not had any problems with Toshiba; they are relatively well constructed and problem free.The m45-S359\u0027s Intel Pentium M processor (2 GHz) is Intel\u0027s fastest processor for laptops to date.","When it works, it\u0027s a fine laptop, but...1) The webcam keeps disappearing from the system setup, and you need to re-install it every time you wanna use it.2) Microsoft\u0027s update and HPS\u0027s update \"compete,\" and one will tell you to update a driver, then the next one will want to replace that driver with its own (the previous one), and so on.3) Slow to boot as HP has it loaded with all its own software (stuff nobody needs).4) The pre-installed CD/DVD burning software never worked properly.5) Wireless is comparatively weak.","Therefore I have been advising Soldiers who are deployed with me to never order from Amazon again and this for I have convinced well over 200 and countingApple iBook Laptop 12.1\" M9164LL/A (800-MHz PowerPC G4, 256 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive) I purchased this computer as a desktop replacement and have had it for about two weeks.","I also wish the keyboard had softer touch like the older Toshiba laptop that I replaced.","I am very happy with my purchase so far.One of the best aspects of this laptop is how silent it is.","But since it is a true 64-bit operating system on this laptop, the stability and power are awesome.","I have had this laptop for two months and it is in general a fine machine.","I recently got this laptop through my company.","It makes everything MUCH easier to use (especially scrolling and right clicking).I plan on buying Macs only from now on! I bought this laptop about a week ago, and so far I have been extremely happy with my purchase.","I was considering other laptops including the business version of an HP laptop but what sold me on this was the fact that it had some really cool extra features like WiFi, WWAN by Cingular, Bluetooth, and a DVD/CD player that does not need a boot into Windows.","If you are still bent upon buying this, all the best!! The laptop is sleek, light, fast and great looking.But what good is all that if just after one year it will start to break down because of a design flaw that leads to overheating of the motherboard? To replace it, if you are out of the factory guarantee of one year (surprisingly convenient timing for HP), you will pay almost the price of a new computer.","Be wary of any laptops with \"good\" native resolutions.","I was ready to buy an HP laptop when I learned that the screen wasn\u0027t covered by any standard warranty.","I leaned the hard way REMOVE IT day one!! It punched a hole in the LCD screen the first time i put the laptop in my very well padded Timbuk2 bag.","I upgraded the hard drive to 500gb following instructions on the internet (google it) and the upgrade wasnt too difficult and the drive appears to work great.Overall this is a good laptop, (yes it IS ok for gaming) just be sure to put xp on it like I did and avoid vista at all costs!!

I am so disappointed because the reason I purchase this computer is Core Duo processor,,,,.","I purchased this based on three reasons.- 4.5 star LaptopMag.com Review (of the older 4500)- Tons of positive User Reviews- After extensive research, it was by far the Best ValueYou simply cannot get a laptop for around $1200 that has all this:- 100G HDD- 1G of RAM- Windows XP Professional (Not Home Edition!)- A decent Processor (Non Celeron!)- DVDR/RWI am impressed by the quality of the material of this laptop.","Among many options I choose this one for many reasons:- Great price- Great desing and look- No MS Windows in it (so I will less vulnerable to viruses)- Excelente application availability (MS Office, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Flash, DVD Authoring, DVD Burning, MSN Messenger, eMail, etc, etc, etc).- Rock solid platform (*nix based).- Good device support (From OSX or *nix)- iSight camera is awesome- Battery performance (up to 4 hours doing stuff like browsing the web, email and chat at the same time).- Huge touchpad- Superb backlit keyboard (nice feeling too)I have read many complaints about this laptop being too hot to use, but as far I can say, I haven\u0027t noticed excessive heat coming up from it.There\u0027s only one minor flaw that could be fixed at newegg for $45: You need 1024Mb RAM to unleash the full power of the CPU, if not, opening Rosetta translated apps will take more time, but after that, the app will work fine.Wireless conectivity is a snap, more friendly than Windows.It took me like 4 days to get used to the new OS, but now I\u0027m like a fish in the water.In short, if you are looking for a laptop that could replace your desktop, or you need power mobility and don\u0027t need to run any particular application that\u0027s availiable to Windows only, then this could be the one that\u0027s for you, as it was for me.","I have been saying I can never trust it again, and I want either a new laptop or my money back.","Most of the laptops out there already have wireless G built in at an equal or lower price.- Hard drive space is another.","I was in the market for a laptop and was looking around.","I have owned several Dell laptops, and while they have not been perfect, the warranty was good for defective parts that came up.","After researching on the web, I disabled the ACPI--the video card and sound card were sharing the same ICQs, and it worked fine.And then when I play Wolfenstein, the game would hard freeze (I have to hard reboot to regain control of the laptop) randomly every 5 - 20 minutes into the game.The same thing happens with Everquest (Luclin) as well.","I will assume that my UX280P will be in good working condition for many years to come.Additionally I have purchased the extended warrently from Sony for all of my laptops and I would recommed it since it has already paid for itself with my first laptop.","The only plus this computer offers over my other laptops is the display which is good for watching movies on DVD.","I about threw the laptop out the window after my last presentation, which required both programs at the same time.","I have come to prefer to watch movies on my laptop as opposed to my television!I noticed another reviewer complaining about the low battery life.","Ordered a HP DV9750 laptop computer with a Expresscard tv tuner included.","This is a more rugged screen than on standard laptops and will not scratch as easily.2.","HP doesn\u0027t respond to your emails and doesn\u0027t care if you are without your laptop for months.","Vista premium, 1 gig of memory, 80gig hard drive, Athlon dual core processor, WXGA 15.4\" screen, GeForce 6150 graphics card, 3 USB slots, and the list goes on.To say this isn\u0027t a screaming deal would be denying yourself a great laptop for a great price.","I\u0027ve had great experiences with a lot of Pavilion model HP computers and bad experiences with Compaq name brand desktops and some laptops.","It is not good for fast typers.I purchased this computer to replace my old Toshiba and Sony laptops, but I find myself going back to these two for all of my audio needs.","If you\u0027re interested in purchasing a new laptop with a Core2Duo for VTX (Intel Virtualization), Sony has this functionality disabled across their entire line with no means of enabling it.","I went from my previous laptop\u0027s resolution of 1280x1050 to 1440x900 and after a few days I\u0027m pretty happy.","If you don\u0027t like Mac? Well, you can just give 95% of your disk over to Windows and use it as the world\u0027s best Windows laptop.","HP was exceptionally generous in this, as they agreed to fix my laptop even though I purchased it second hand and it was more than a year out of warranty; however, that was about three years ago (it is now March 2010).","So what do I do now with the 4 USB port\u0027s...?!And all my new documents I need to transfer to my Laptop...?!Any suggestions...?! I got this A13585-s4527 from Office Depot and added 2 gig memory and removed Vista and installed XP Professional.","Yes I would like 2-3 USB ports, but Targus makes some really tiny 4 port hubs for now.I\u0027m honestly not sure I would make any different design choices, and technology progress will take care of the only thing I\u0027ve found to be occasionally very limiting (disk size and performance). after buying and returning two laptops for various reasons, i have to say that the acer 4504 is by far my favorite.. and the 2nd benefit is that it was the cheapest of them all!the screen is digustingly clear, the curvature of the keypad helps eliminate accidentally touching the touchpad, hinges are sturdy, etc.**update, 7/25/05:the silver case holds up much better than i thought... it looked like it was flaking off, like i\u0027ve heard averatecs do occasionally..","After two years, I have not had one issue with this laptop and I use it for hours daily.","Other perks include built-in wireless networking and a memory stick slot.Now the downside-the laptop does not have a very large range of available features-you can choose XP pro or home, 40-80GB hard drive, and more memory, but not much else is optional.","I bought this laptop yesterday.","Within one year of owning this laptop, the modem broke and the LCD screen started to flicker.","Don\u0027t be fooled by it being rated as a 1 GHz processor, because a 1 GHz processor in a Mac is much faster than a 1 GHz IBM compatible computer.Furthermore, the battery life is amazing for a laptop (approx.","I purchased this laptop specifically because it was connected with the Lance Armstrong Foundation.","In fact, I am so satisfied with my new ThinkPad that I decide to write my first product review ever.THINKPAD T60 FEATURESCore Duo chipset and superior configuration optionsSturdy, classic design: Unlike other laptops with a modular design, ThinkPad is tightly put together.","Anyways, I have been a VAIO User ever since I started using laptops, so I was kind of used to the heating thing.","This laptop doesn\u0027t have a reset hole, you just have to press and hold the on/off switch.I highly recommend this laptop.","I actually worry about it starting a fire (this does happen; a friend\u0027s laptop ignited her coffee table in the middle of the night; no defects were ever identified).- Screen latch is badly placed and frequently flips up while I\u0027m using the computer- Screen hinges seem weak and flaky; they feel weaker every day, and I fully expect one or both to break in the near future.- Screen design makes it impossible to hold the laptop in one arm when it\u0027s closed; no matter how you grip it or how lightly you hold it, you feel like you\u0027re crushing or at least badly bending the screen (because you are).- Screen suffers random areas of burn-out where the backlight fails or becomes permanently and abnormally bright (this happened almost immediately when I got it, for no apparent reasons).- Ergonomics? Awful.","Warranty is the standard 1 yr one for laptops which is useful since most of the likely defects / problems will occur in the first year itself.10.","To this day, I love it and it competes with recently released laptops in terms of processing power, size, and overall comfort of use.","My wife has a Windows 7 Laptop by another maker, and the display on this one I think is better.","I purchased this laptop in August, and I have been very satisfied with it since.","This laptop has great graphics and speed.","Those \"bargain\" PC laptops don\u0027t have near the features, and once you start adding upgrades to match the features in this MacBook, the price escalates quickly.","i am putting this review on 06/29/05. since todate i did not receive my laptop.","Otherwise, it is very touchy when I type.Right now, mine is about 1.5 years old and I am looking for a new laptop.","I bought a 215 series laptop from Office Depot a week ago and got the Black Screen of Death an hour into using it.","This is a good laptop and I am pleased that I\u0027ve choosen HP.","I think apple\u0027s biggest mistake with the new laptops is the nonremovable battery.","I have no idea how I survived for so long without this Thinkpad! I have almost a month with this laptop and I can tell you that is a good investment.pros1.","The only problem that I found with this laptop is that if you turn the volume up loud, and place your hand over the left speaker, you will hear L-O-U-D auditory feedback.","I would look up and see \"Mryw nt to th tore\" Hmm, these same problems on BOTH of our laptops...","It is not that important for me though.I would strongly recommend trying the laptop out at a local store before buying it.","However, hers was getting much hotter than mine so I think there may have been a flaw with her laptop.","My toshiba laptop had an antireflective layer coated on the screen which decreased the amount of background light reflected back to the viewer, and the resulting image was really wonderful to watch.","Bought this laptop and I don\u0027t have much to say as it failed to boot within three days of purchase.","Unbelievable that they delivered to me a non-working laptop.","I only use this laptop via wifi and have had no connection problems anywhere in my home.","Now however, I do use it to login to the laptop and it seems to work very well, with a success rate of over 98% recognition at the first swipe.10) Value for money - Given the fact that Sony offers only one year standard warranty (DELL gives 3 years on the D620), I feel that is still a bit pricey and a good price point for a machine like this would be around $1,650.","Very enjoyable to use! After spending a couple of weeks researching the current laptop market for a good general purpose, desktop replacement machine, I discovered the A135-S4427 was being sold at a nationwide chain as an \"in store only\" special for $200 off the list price.","I wrote a review just a couple of weeks ago on this same laptop.","So be sure to check out Fujitsu\u0027s laptops as well, but I don\u0027t believe any other company\u0027s have this technology so far.15.4\" for a screen is quite large, and the fact that it\u0027s widescreen makes it even sweeter.","I had the worst experience with buying a laptop on line.","A laptop isn\u0027t much good if you can\u0027t charge the battery.","That software was missing from my laptop (see review below as another customer had the same problem and Toshiba refused to help them).","I bought this laptop on the 2nd day after it release.","TECH SUPPORT HELP CORRECT THOSE PROBLEMSOVERALL, ITS A GREAT CENTRINO MULTIMEDIA/BUSINESS LAPTOP, ALL PROGRAMS WORK FAST AND THE SYSTEM SEEMS VERY STABLE.SO AFTER TWO MONTHS..","At any moment it could be stolen and I am much more at peace with a loss of 1500 dollars for a top of the line iBook which can be much more readily replaced than 3000 dollars for a top of the line PowerBook.My laptop has survived a 2 ft plus drop while open from a bed to a not so plush carpeted floor.","I have Norton Internet Security, which severely slows down ANY system, and the S150 is still fantastically fast (once you get it booted, that is).Screen: The screen isn\u0027t very large, due to the small size of the laptop, but it\u0027s VERY bright, and has little to no glare.","I\u0027ve had this laptop for 1 month short of three years, and I\u0027m typing this review on it.","Well, I keep my laptop plugged in all the time so that\u0027s not a problem for me.","The sound is the best I\u0027ve heard on a laptop.","I was sold on two things in this laptop First it has the best picture/screen among other brands on the shelf, and the 1 Gig of Ram.","On physical construction, probably not the most solid laptop.","My main bones of contention included 10 hours to back up 30-40G of data, and the computer\u0027s inability to run more than one program at once; Windows Explorer froze constantly requiring closure of the running program.I decided to give the laptop one more chance but the last straw occurred when a 6G backup took 4 hours and configuration of Windows updates took over 2 hours.","I had to put the 2GB module in the lower slot (one nearest pc board) or the laptop would not start up.","This is a desktop masquerading as a laptop, and believe me, at a whopping 10 pounds it isn\u0027t going to be making very many trips.","Solid feel (compared to other laptops), full num pad.-Lightscribe DVD.","I bought this laptop a little over 2 years ago.","Almost every laptop has the option to upgrade to Bluetooth.","So if you are looking at this item, make sure to count the extras that you would have to add to another laptop to make it do all the things this one does.Although the look of a computer is one of the least important, admittedly, it is very attractive and a discussion piece no matter where you go.I do not want to talk about the harddrive size and memory since this will be different in different models.Pros:SizeDisplayIntegrated CDRW/DVD(RW)Integrated WifiIntegrated Camera (Still/Video/Webcam)Centrino (low voltage)Battery lifeMagicGate Memorystick slotThe TOuchpad has special sections that let you add extra functionalityCons:No restore cd\u0027sNo Bluetooth (some models do include Bluetooth) I have the same configuration except a faster processor and bluetooth for eight-fifty shipped directly from HP.","I thing that I don\u0027t like about it is how hot it gets underneath the mouse pad it get\u0027s very warm after an 1 hour of use, not sure if all laptops are like this but, I def. need to buy a cooling pad for it since I put it on my lap to use.","I bought this laptop specifically for work on the road.","The operating temperature of the laptop doesn\u0027t get excessively hot like other laptops.","It is actually easier and faster to install XP in Fusion than to reinstall my Toshiba laptop with XP preinstalled.My only gripe is the unit I got had Tiger 10.4 installed and not Leopard.","Could not have expected more from a computer of this price (got it for $499.99AR from CUSA)!

holding out for something that would be portable, powerful and stylish.","The laptop would never run reliably with a 256 MB module, crashing consistently.","I took it to a computing center and got them to open it up and clear out the dust - I\u0027d long since been off warranty.I also went out and dropped 20 dollars on an extrernal antec laptop fan.","Sure it\u0027s really light and pretty, but that\u0027s about all this laptop has to offer.First off, Gateway has just about the worst customer service ever - when I ordered the laptop, they kept delaying the shipment and I ended up waiting almost a full month extra before getting the laptop.","I plugged an external monitor to the video card, but it did not show an image.HP knows that their is a design defect with this laptop, specifically the nVidia chipset that they use.","This machine is solid as they come.Speaking of solid: the keyboard is easily the best I have ever used on a laptop.","I wanted a laptop mostly for the portability.","The included DVD-Rom/CDRW drive is very nice addition on a budget laptop such as this, it doesn\u0027t come with a floppy drive, but all laptops today do not either.","I bought this laptop at a local Office Max or one of those places last year.","The exhaust from the cpu fan is on the right side of the laptop and when using the mouse (which I use 99% of the time) then my mouse and my hand gets very hot.","It\u0027s not a high end laptop, but it\u0027s nice.","There is only one mouse button leaving this PC user always wanting to right click for context-specific menus.Wireless range was surprisingly poor compared to two HP laptops and data transfer speed decreased dramatically as the signal grew weaker.","I also love the external look of the laptop, but it has some definite issues and is sadly lacking in areas.What I Love:- Initial setup was really, really easy.- Connecting to wireless* networks and bluetooth has been a cinch- It is speedy- I am able to run VMWare Fusion on it and install a Windows virtual machine.","I think if you are taking the risk to buy a laptop go with an inexpensive one.","This is a good laptop for school.","But the laptop otherwise served me well.","I have a vacation home and did not want to invest in another computer or laptop though e-mail is a way of life for me now.","I ordered a refurbished e-machines Laptop.","My PC laptop drags to a crawl when on battery.The computer starts up in a few seconds (a large improvement over the past Macs that I have owned).At this point, I hardly use my wintel based PCs.","I bought my laptop in March, by April I deeply regretted it.","For about a year this laptop worked well.","I thought laptops were portable so you could travel with them.","I looked at Dell, and Overstock, and Amazon, and most of the laptops I wanted with at leasst 1GB were $1,000 to $1,500.","I have owned an IBM thinkpad for years, and needed a new laptop.","Laptop sound quality is generally average at best, and this add-on card could be a nice upgrade.This computer is also very quiet, relatively speaking, which is very important to me since I don\u0027t like noisy computers.","But with a computer this size, you probably won\u0027t be carrying it with you to a lot of places.BOTTOM LINE: This is the laptop for the causal PC user.","It\u0027s also a lot better than having to remove the WiFi card, that stick out of my laptop, when I have to put it in my laptop bag.I say if you upgrade the memory it can be more than an entry level laptop.","The technician\u0027s verdict: \"There\u0027s no mechanical problem, this is Microsoft\u0027s fault, the laptop is within Sony specifications.\"","I don\u0027t understand why this company can\u0027t get it right....so now, I\u0027m supposed to use the $175 towards another pos?

I\u0027ve had this laptop since October and I\u0027ve been very pleased except for 2 issues: first, the Turion processor is incompatable with Matlab (according to the developers) which I need for school work, though I\u0027ve had no other compatability issues; second, the integrated graphics are OK for watching movies, but virtually useless for games less than 3 years old.Other than that, I\u0027ve been very happy with the computer so far (I\u0027ve had it for 3.5+ months so far).","The fan will only come on when the laptop is superhot.","I used to leave my old laptop at home because I didn\u0027t want to carry its 6 pounds around with me all day just because I *might* use it.","It wasn\u0027t the laptop that I wanted but I\u0027am satisfied with it.","HORRIBLE battery life.... this is a 4 cell battary.. which means the laptop needs to be recharged every 2 hours or so.","For me, the FS680 has all the mobility of any other laptop, but with desktop-like power inside, plus features that even some desktops don\u0027t have.","The laptop is great, its fast good looking, and gets the job done.","I turned my laptop on today and the screen does not work.","I bought one of their laptops less than a year ago.","I\u0027ve gotten by nicely with this laptop as my only computer for the past three years.","No major complaints.The glossy screen makes a huge difference, especially when viewing DVD\u0027s with the laptop.","So to me this means, they just do not care once the item is sold! I have only one thing to say NEVER BUY TOSHIBA I purchased the Toshiba Satellite A15-S129 (Celeron 2.4GHz) about eight weeks ago and it has surpassed all my expectations! My previous laptop was also a Toshiba but I was lured by the \"bells and whistles\" that came with the Compaq Presario (P4 - 2.3GHz) and HP Pavilion (AMD Athlon XP-M 2500+) notebooks - Also more expensive! I bought both of these laptops but promptly returned them after encountering problems with the CD burner on the Compaq and noting a rhythmic \"clicking\" noise when idle on the HP.If you\u0027re like me and use the computer mainly for word processing, accounting, websurfing, emailing, listening to music, and watching DVDs, the Celeron processor has way more than enough \u0027pep\u0027.","Fourteen days after the reported theft and filing of the claim with Compaq I am still waiting for the replacement laptop (which is a different model from the discontinued 700z) from Compaq.","The MacBook Pro is the single most capabale machine, laptop or otherwise on the face of the planet.","Sandpaper can ease the edges, but taking wood working tools to a $3,000 laptop shouldn\u0027t be required.","Within few months, I noticed that cooling fan was always on, i contacted sony customer service they told me that i had a set up problem.Since last 6 months, laptop was getting overheated and crashed so many times.","The only things that I feel could be remedied are somewhat par for the course for this class of machine (retail prebuilt).If I happen into anyone looking for a laptop and this class of machine, I will definitely recommend it.","I\u0027ve owned this laptop for about eight months, and its battery life has dwindled to about 45 minutes, from a high of about two hours.I assumed that a Sony product would, at a minimum, have decent audio quality, but the speakers are so quiet-- even at full volume-- that headphones are a necessity.As a desktop replacement, this computer works fine.","Dont buy this laptop, and if you are travelling abroad, dont buy Toshiba.After 6 weeks it went dead, and online support was no help, told me to send it in for repair, contacted Toshiba Mexico:They want 100 dollars up front to do anything, I am now thinking of throwing it away and buying a Gateway instead.Mexico October 5 2007 Don\u0027t buy this notebook computer.","Doesn\u0027t fit in most standard laptop cases, you\u0027ll likely have to buy a new case.2.","I would not recommend to buy this laptop.","It may look like a lame laptop on the outside.","This laptop reeks of quality.","every feature is worth it and for personal or bussness definately worth the money.i hope you found this review helpful and get this laptop so you will be anouther witness to this wonderful product.","You cannot find a comparable 12.1\" laptop in the PC world (w/o spending nearly 2 Grand, and most don\u0027t come with an optical drive built-in).I don\u0027t see much of a reason to go with 14.1\" as it has the same resolution as the 12\" (unless that you have bad vision).","I\u0027ve only recently upgraded it to 2 GB RAM. after 2 month of normal use the screen broke (red spots began to appear)I sent the laptop to technical service in texasfirst they don\u0027t pay for shipingthe laptop is sitting in the service for 4 weeks , they inform me that they are waiting for parts to repair my unitthey advertise that their service is 24/7 and when you call the service is available only monday to friday in business hoursRecommendation : do not buy any Averatec product After 3 months using it, I found that the touch mouse was acting like crazy.","For example, if you have 256MB of memory installed on your laptop and use 16MB for your video, then you actually only have 240MB of memory.","You can expect the successor models to use an Intel chip.I bought an iBook (my first laptop) with full knowledge that it will not be around in its current iteration much longer.Why? iBooks get pretty good reviews for laptop reliability.","This may be a bit lengthy but I hope it helps those of you looking to buy a laptop.","I was a bit dissapointed it came with no word processing software other than \"pages\" for 30 days which is very limited I was able to pick this laptop up recently for $450 shipped.","Have tried 2 other laptops but this one performed better.","Hope this helped a bit.(If the laptop is unavailable on amazon, try best buy!) It\u0027s thin, light weight and very fast.","However, my experience with this laptop was SO ABYSMAL that I feel that I am morally obligated to forewarn consumers considering buying a Toshiba laptop, nevertheless an M45.In just under two years, I have experienced the following issues:- The chrome paint on the casing fades where my hands rested- The left touchpad button\u0027s paint came off as well- The screen developed a yellowish shade on the bottom in the center- The USB ports broke (both physically and when repaired they simply stopped functioning as well! Poor craftsmanship all-around)- The keys occaisionally popped off (fixable but annoying)- The disc drive stopped working...","I love this as well as I can read my personal outlook emails on the device and my personal gmails at once without them being deleted so my regular laptop still has a full email record.I am starting to use the MSFT Origami interface that comes with it, and so far I like the interface for playing music.The device only has 1 gig of ram, but I have open and am using onenote, windows live mail, lotus notes, a few browser windows, word and am playing music on it with only the most occasional music stutter.... with the Vista OS.It launches applications slowly once you have consumed the ram and the hard drive isn\u0027t all that fast ... but once launched it swaps between applications fine.(+- 11 sec to load excel as opposed to +- 4 sec on my fast LT)Remember I only bought this to take electronic notes on ..... but I may even leave my laptop at home next trip.I am buying the larger 6 cell battery (I think it should have come with this already for the price) but I got over +- 3.5 hours with wireless on and connected with the std battery.","All this within two weeks of owning the laptop.","I\u0027ve been using various brands of laptops, including Dell, HP, and Compaq, and I still perfer the IBM T series.","All in all, I was happy with the speakers and sound quality, but not blown away.After taking my CD out, I started opening every application on the laptop.","Ok Gaming laptop,The 8600m GT is not a very powerful card, not many intensive games run well at naitive 1680 1050,Amazing user interface, volume controls etc are very smooth and slick.Asus offers 1 year of free accidental damage protection for ALL NOTEBOOKS so Free Insurance!DONT BUY FROM BEST BUY\u0026lt; they have a gimped, slower model, with no accessories, and only a 1 year warranty!!I Liked this computer, i hated the best buy edition, And i needed something with alot more power.","Great laptop running for 5 years now...never gave trouble for day...works like a beast still!!!! Great laptop, Tablet, do what you want it to do, it\u0027s powerful compact, and the touch screen feature is amazing! Best tablet pc ever Great laptop.","Furthermore, there are much larger \u0026quot;wrist rest\u0026quot; areas than on other laptops, making it more comfortable ergonomically.Cons:1.","I wish I had chosen a different laptop, this one is very disappointing.","I got this laptop for about $860 in December of \u002708.","The unit is put together well but visually, the looks are an acquired taste.Another problem is the keyboard which seems so small compared to the rest of the laptop.","I really love it! I got this laptop locally at a bargain.","The graphic driver did not function correctly, Vista is confusing, keypad is slow to respond, I called the TOSHIBA technical support number more than 10 times within 3 days of receiving the laptop!!! And the TOSHIBA support line is a wast of time.","ocupo esta computadora para hacer trabajos de programacion y dise\u0026ntilde;os con grandes bases de datos la velocidad y la forma de manejar la memoria son exelentes, algunas veces la conecto a una red nt, a internet, a una pocket pc y no baja su rendimiento, pase tres meses buscando un computador de bajo precio con tecnologia de punta, y esto compre u no me arrepiento, la compare con la de la marca dell, compaq y ninguna supera a esta laptop.","I have never had this laptop crash, I have never had noise issues.","NVIDIA has a GPU litigation that is going on and this laptop falls under one of the affected models.","I upgraded the memory to 1.256 MB and now works fantastic...The best thing that I couldnt find in other laptop the MP3 functionalitty y fantastic...!!! you only have to store your mp3 in the 2GB space (D Drive) and create your play list with the bluebird software and you have to turn off your pc, and then just press the power button on your AV Control Panel and Voila!!!Resgards,Ramon I have this little friend for over 4 years now and all I can say is the best of everything.","I\u0027ve used it for emergency email (when I did not have my phone with me or was out of minutes) a few times and it realy saved my [...]!I can\u0027t say enough good things about the UX-280P with it and my desktop I have no use for a common laptop anymore ...","Caveat Emptor ...The sort summary:Even if you are a programmer/developer, this laptop will win, you will loose.My rant:Being a professional developer of 15++ years, I have to say that this is really a horribly an woefully bad piece of hardware.","It works fine on battery and plugged in, so I really didn\u0027t lose any functionality.The laptop operating system doesn\u0027t break down, although it does freeze every once in a while.","This PC would be SOO much better if it just had a mic (like MOST laptops do!).Overall this is a GREAT machine though, and I have been very happy with it.","The performance and specs of this laptop is amazing, comprable to one that you would pay $1,900+ for.","This deficiency slows and spoils the performance of an otherwise very good machine Net/net:1) GREAT! for web surfing, managing/editing multi-media (especially stills/videos of the kids), and MS-office apps2) Good to okay for gamers (Half-life does well, but Doom 3 and Everquest 2 can get bogged down)3) This is my 9th machine for home use (9 desktops; 2 laptops) and my 2nd Sony.","It might just be the perfect laptop at any price.","David Pogue\u0027s book iMovie HD was an invaluable helper in the project.After using a Dell laptop for years, I am impressed by the way the iBook instantly is ready to use on opening the display, and how the iBook usually runs silently.","This has not been a problem at all on my system.I have competed in a Laptop Battle with this machine as well, running on batteries with no problems either.","This smallness does NOT sacrifice power, and the Toshiba comes out ahead of comparable systems in processing speed and other benchmarks, but there are sacrifices: a smaller keyboard than the preferred industry standard IBM-LENOVO laptops, and a smaller screen than the luxuriously huge gaming and multimedia machines by Sony and most other makers.","It is $100 cheaper because it has XP Home instead of Professional, but the differences between these two operating systems is minimal except to more advanced users.This laptop is also exceptionally quiet (except when using the CD drive) and comes with a variety of programs installed on it already, which are nice additions but not necessary.","Currently I can still power the laptop but cannot get the battery to recharge, and if I bump the cord the unit simply shuts off with no warning.","I purchased this laptop in March 2007.","So far the best laptop I have ever had.","There have been no problems with the computer as received, its components nor its software.I am happy to indulge my husband with this laptop, but it does irk me to pay the extra grand over what this laptop is actually worth just for the Sony name.","Find someone who has had the laptop for a while and get their opinion.","If you are serious about buying a laptop and you want quality for a good price, then this is the laptop for you.","On display at a national computer store, the PCG-K13 stood out among the other laptops for brightness and clarity.The PCG-K13 employs the Fujitsu MHT2040AT 40 Gb. hard drive which is whisper quiet.","Eventually my laptop doesn\u0027t take any cd only DVD\u0027s.","On the other hand, it is somewhat reminicent of many Mac laptops I see at Starbucks.The very first thing I wanted to do with this laptop was use the included Norton AntiVirus.","Owned it for over a year and would NEVER buy another Sony laptop.","Well, I work at Sybase and have used laptops at work exclusively for the last 8 years.","Anyway, compared to the laptops I\u0027ve used before, I\u0027d have to say that it\u0027s sucks.","Not sure what they mean (driver perhaps?), but ours can connect to N networks just fine.* Lack of bluetooth is disappointing, especially since we were planning to get the bluetooth ExpressCard Remote to go with the machine to control Media Center remotely.Overall, it\u0027s a nice laptop that you should plan on spend some time to configure.","Why all notebook screens aren\u0027t of the anti-glare matte finish is a mystery to me.After buying a second HP laptop a year or so ago, we\u0027ve decided that HP support is practically non-existent and unless you\u0027re up to replacing parts yourself you might want to consider a different brand (or maybe they\u0027re all that way?) I bought this notebook on 04/03/07.","In general, AMD laptops are cheaper than Intel laptops in equivalent models and performance specifications.","Love it, Love it, Love it!!!This is the best \u0027laptop\u0027 I\u0027ve ever had -- great graphics, serious sound, and a cool keyboard design.","Laptops often do that anyway and the pad/fan works wonders.","In 1982 I spent $1,000. for a 64 Kilobyte Radio Shack Model 100 laptop that used 16 kilobytes for B.A.S.I.C.","I find the cdr/rw/dvd drive to be an average laptop drive... a little flimsy... but most are.","I have this same laptop i got at wal-mart although it only has a 30gb hard drive(yet another draw back).When you actually go into the system settings it only has 192mb of onboard RAM to run windows with,64mb of it going to the powerful graphics card that it has.","I spent less than $200 (shipping included) on a quality piece of machinery that does everything that I need it to do, and is comparable performance-wise, to the newer and MUCH MORE expensive laptops that are selling now.","The casing gets finger prints on it very easily, and though mine has not gotten any scratches because I keep it in its case when I\u0027m not using it, I could imagine it\u0027s finish getting scuffed.The only other complaint that I have about this computer, and its a minor one, is it doesn\u0027t get the wi-fi range that my last laptop did.","Again, I\u0027m new to this so I don\u0027t know whether this is common with laptops or not.Overall, I think this Toshiba has been a quality purchase.","I\u0027d like more than 2 usb ports.If you\u0027re a gamer, buy an Alienware laptop for 4 times the price.","There are still a few minor things missing, like the back-lit keyboard, which works under OS X but not yet under XP.Anyway, so far this is a gorgeous laptop for OS X or Windows XP.","I\u0027m stuck only able to use it while plugged in but, I\u0027m purchasing a new battery.Like I stated earlier...this laptop has been very, very good to me.","A little large for a laptop, but probably because of its speakers, built in.","I recommmend this laptop to people who like to do a variety of things with computers because with Mac\u0027s, you can do so much with them with ease.","I happened to have 2 GB from another laptop and I swapped it.","As far as resetting the computer they say to insert a pin into the reset hole like the old laptops.","Freebies are Comic Life, iLife (iMovie, iTunes, iDVD, iWeb, Garageband), and Omni Outliner.It took me roughly 2 hours to completely configure the new laptop the way I wanted it (most of the time taken up by installing Parallels (with Windows XP taking 45 minutes), Final Cut Studio, XCode, Office, Aperture, Freeway, and iWork).","Performance-wise, this laptop is quite peppy with everything I\u0027ve thrown at it so far.Software-wise, I really like OS X. Everything just works--and works quickly and smoothly.","I am a student and i have very limited options in terms of how much i can afford to buy a laptop....i came across this piece HP special edition L2105NR, and i went ahead tentatively and bought it for about 900$.And i was more than happy after i used this one for about a month now.it\u0027s got a very good processor in the making (AMD turion-64),which seems very fast,though it could generate quite a bit of heat.one more thing whic i liked about it is its mobility,it weighs around 5.4 lbs which for sure is an added advantage,and it catches up wireless networks pretty good.and I love the keypad which comes with this piece.as far as i could see,the disadvantage of this is the heat which it generates when you work for long hours.but otherwise i feel this piece is worth a buy.","My former laptop was a Presario 2500 and the screen wasn\u0027t bright enough without having it maxed out which reduces battery time.Good keyboard ,sound is very good, only negative is the cpu fan runs constantly but not real loud.","My laptop has outlasted my brother\u0027s Toshiba, countless Dells belonging to friends, AND a Macbook.-Battery never lasted more than 2 hours.-CD/DVDrom is kind of noisy.I definitely recommend this model.","Around \u002701, I gave up the desktop for a Fujitsu refurbished laptop.","I would recommend against buying this laptop if you need any of them.","I don\u0027t want to sound pessimistic, but if it\u0027s not about the money, aim a little higher.If you look for a really modestly priced business laptop, this might just be one of the best out there, compare to simliar Thinkpads, Toshibas and Dells.","I received the laptop as promised around 4 or 5 days after I purchased it.","Most laptops have it on the bottom of the PC and this one is under the keyboard and a heatsink/protective cover.Sound is excellent, though, if a little quiet.","I own this laptop myself and it is very impressive I have owned dell and hp laptops before and I got to hand it to toshiba, my satelite is superior to hp and dell.","I called Toshiba about my defective USB ports, they told me they would send me a box to have my laptop repaired in, then they didnt send anything.","i think i would rather talk to a telemarketer.only buy this if you are in need of a VERY CHEAP laptop...","I bought this laptop 2 days ago and it came OVER LOADED with 3rd party software like Vongo, AOl and more.","They choose to say nothing about the RAM (or lack thereof), and when the laptop arrived at my doorstep, I wasn\u0027t thrilled to see that it contained 256 megabytes of molasses-slow RAM.","Removing or attaching the laptop demands to disconnect virtually all connections although you don\u0027t have to shut it down.5.","The left speaker is a bit iffy, and the little rubber feet on the bottom fell off (Apple have me free replacements and I superglued them on), but the fact that it is still in one piece after my junior and senior year is a feat of engineering and good design.If you are looking for a laptop that needs to take a relative amount of wear and tear, this is without a doubt the best option.","I find that they over-do it with the more advanced systems, I really don\u0027t think most laptops are designed to handle all that.","It is light and thin enough to carry with one hand especially when you disconnect it from the dock.I got this laptop so that I can write my status reports, fill out my timesheet and read eBooks while flying coach.","I hope that the amazon corporate office see this scam and take consideration.I am NOT HAPPY!!! I rate this laptop highly in all areas except the DVD-RW drive has never worked.","throwing in a neoprene case or something should have been included for an 1800 dollar laptop.","The smallest, lightest laptop around! Just bought this machine and noticed right away that the Sony specs have this drive partitioned with the C drive being too small for practical purposes if you start loading any third party software on.","The built in speakers on this laptop are average for laptops - rotten.","I didn\u0027t have much time to play with the laptop since I was entertaining a lady friend that evening and had to go to work the next day therefore my playtime with the notebook was only a few hours.","The laptop has very good build: light weight, LED back-lit screen, \u0026 4 to 5 hours battery life at one full charge.","PROS:1GB RAM - A given standard, even for start laptopsDVD Burner - A nice luxury120 GB HD - Hefty enough for the profession, light enough for the business userWidescreen Display - Bright and cleanCONS:Last gen Core Duo - The Core 2 Duos are much, much more efficient and are being seen in many more laptops of comperable specsClunky build - Have I mentioned this when I reviewed a non Vista version a few months ago; this case has been used since like 2001Weight - A little on the heavy side, a pain to travel with dailyINTEGRATED GRAPHICS - Even an FX5200, a $30 card would be nice, just to get the 64-bit true for of Vista.","Their express program offers aggressive pricing and good availability on certain laptop configurations aimed at small and medium businesses.","Merely 3 months after I had purchased my laptop, it broke and would not even turn on.","That\u0027s why Averatec was the best choice for me.I have also noticed that the fan is slightly noisy and just like most laptops, it tends to get warm (but not HOT).","The laptop overheats and destroys the motherboard.DO NOT BUY HP! They have refused to acknowledge its design defect and have refused to help any of the costumers who have wasted upwards of $1200.00 USD from purchasers! In fact, I have written to the CEO\u0027s office twice and to no avail, they have refused to help me.","These notebooks may have the same problems as other Sony laptops, but what brand doesn\u0027t? Being someone in higher education for the past 5 years, I have seen quite a few brands of laptops from Toshiba to IBM to Mac\u0027s and the infamous Compaq.","I know i\u0027ve got many years ahead that it will work great (another wonderful Apple trait is that you do NOT need to get a new machine nearly as often as a PC because OS updates and changes work great several generations back - I have several \"old\" macs running OS X Panther just fine, thank you).Go for it! You will not be disappointed! I am always skeptical with these inexpensive laptops and this time I should have been more so.","I ordered this laptop about 1 month ago to use for school.","I also purchased a PC laptop somewhere along the way, but returned it because of some mysterious problem.Some years later I started looking for another laptop because I am going to be doing some traveling, and would not think of being without a computer.","Although the laptop is quite fast I would not recommend this unit (or any other compaq) to anyone due to the poor customer support provided by compaq I have never had to deal with such a poor support staff among all of the other companies I have dealt with in the past.","It\u0027s not an issue with the laptop but I figured those Chrome fans out there would like to know that I\u0027ve had an unfortunate experience with it on this MBP.Finally, it runs pretty cool on average but when I run a VM or a few things at once it does tend to heat up and I end up turning up the fan speed with SmcFanControl.","Basically that laptop is just a waste of power until I can get the drivers, so off hunting the internal component drivers from vendors.","It seems like the perfect solution to having a PDA and a laptop.","I do freelance writing and design and enjoy the flexibility I get with a laptop.","I bought this laptop almost a year ago from Circuit City.","The wireless was confusing as I was using 128 bit encyrption but the Toshiba would not allow me to input the 25 character WEP, so I had to change my other 2 wireless laptops to 64 bit so that the Toshiba would work.Other than what I descibed above, the system is perfect for my son\u0027s needs.","I am not a gammer, and wouldn\u0027t recommend this laptop for that purpose (not that it would do poorly mind you...","I\u0027ve had this laptop for a little over three years now, and since then, I\u0027ve gone through two hard-drives with another about to die, and the cd-burner/dvd-rom hasn\u0027t worked well since about the second month of purchase.","I love this laptop, despite its 3 shortcomings above.","If you need a notebook that is ultra-portable, has great battery life, and is loaded with features, the iBook is the notebook for you.Soli Deo Gloria! After a couple of months of searching, I eventually settled on buying a couple of these laptops for my engineers.","So far, the laptop has impressed me, no problems yet (unusual!)The 32 mb video ram, 30 gb hard drive, 1.6 P4-M and 512 mb ddr-sdram makes this laptop a great buy for the price! Before this Macbook Pro, I have had two $2,500 and $3,000 Windows machines, which did ok.This is the best computer I have ever used.","price- lets face it... this isn\u0027t the cheapest laptop on the planet... though it is one of the fastest and best equippedAll in all, I would probably rate this as a 4.5 star computer.","In addition, I really like the soft quiet keyboard, the light weight of this laptop, and many Toshiba touchpad options.","One of my favorite things about it is the keyboard actually, it is designed to be quieter/softer and its nice that that is something Sony thought about in a cheaper laptop.","I had been reluctant to adapt to notebook PCs due to the small keyboards and most laptops/notebooks are not really either small nor light.I bought mine as if by love at first sight, beautifull siver, 1\" thick and 4.5 lbs in weight, it stood out on the shelf.The Averatec is fast enough so that you really won\u0027t miss ultra fast processing (wouldn\u0027t make sense to expect workstation or gamestation ultra speed in a notebook for the road) I would think.It\u0027s a problem of definition, for me a \"portable PC\" is just what Averatec packages in the 3270, the best performance you can get economically.With a 60/80 Gb HD, DVD burner, wireless card, SMALL and LIGHT frame, 2.5 hour battery, great screen, 512 Mb memory...I watch DVD\u0027s, browse, work with Photoshop, listen to music and get asked frequently \"what PC is that... for how much..?It does perfectly well all that is not \"extreme\", but then again, how much extreme do you need..?Makes me feel great.I dumped my Toshiba Satellite and wouldn\u0027t pay 2000 bucks for a replacement, I tell you.But got mine for $900.00 and got a $150 bucks rebate.Need to have the fastestes or most expensive..? Don\u0027t look here.Need a PORTABLE PC...?Get an Averatec ! I had been researching on ultramobile PCs for quite a while and even looked at the Asus Eee PC, which is cheap but has a terrible low-res low-quality screen (and weighs a hefty 2 lbs, the same as my Sharp PC-MM20 *real* laptop with more memory and a 40GB hard drive).","In a way I\u0027m glad for this, as it affords better protection and got me into the practice of being more gentle to the laptop.* Last but not least, the laptop battery: Not only did it never last much more than 2.5 hours (it was supposed to be at least 3), after about 2 years the battery started failing.","Overall, the laptop is pretty good.","I bought this laptop for home/school use and it is awesome! I up the memory to 1.5 gigs and this thing runs great! Couldn\u0027t be happier with it.","I know on paper it looks like good performance for the money, but believe me, it isn\u0027t!

You betcha but, I\u0027m afraid, this one won\u0027t last for the 4-year current company announced laptop lifecycle.","I knew that I wanted to spend under one-thousand bucks for the laptop and any needed accessories.","If you need a second extra 9-cell battery, you\u0027ll probably end up with 5-6 pound in your computer bag, which is more or less the same weight as a normal lightweight laptop!In my own opinion, I think this is a very good laptop for frequent travelers who don\u0027t need to run resource-demanding applications and use optical drive only occasionally.","DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP.","Overall, this is an excellent laptop and provides everything you\u0027d need in a computer in a portable laptop package.","It took only couple of hours to get used to the 17mm keys, one thing I am missing is the larger shift key on the right-hand side.This is not a low-budget item, there are laptops on the market for 800$, this clearly is more expensive, but you get what you pay for.","It also seems to run hotter than most other laptops.","But for those of you who have taken the leap into DSL -- I\u0027ll admit that I\u0027m still using only a dial-up connection -- then this is something you won\u0027t have to worry about since this laptop has an ethernet port.","Amazing.One other feature not mentioned by other reviewers: all ports (USB, PC-MIA, etc.) are on the sides of the laptop (just two--headphones and microphone) are on the front, near a conveniently placed volume control, and (this is cool) a switch to turn Wifi connections on/off.","Yes, this meant that I would be spending my own money on a work laptop when I could use a Windows PC for free, but I no longer cared.When I received the machine, I started putting it through its paces and was somewhat nonplussed.","Anyone who finds their laptop to be a necessity in their life should not buy a Compaq because one can only wonder when it will crash and become completely inaccessible.Even when it was working, it would constantly freeze up or be extremely slow while running prgrams.","The laptop was well packaged, but it didn\u0027t come with a handbook or any type of user\u0027s manual (or anything at all except the acessories, actually); just a sheet of paper with instructions on how to set it up (i.e. \"Press the \u0027ON\u0027 button\u0027\").","However at 1.83 gigahertz the OS has just about caught up with the horsepower!

However, despite this minor issue with Their website, I have had nothing but good help from them.","Anyone who is looking for a smoking laptop, this is the one.","I had MS Office bought 2yrs back that I wanted to use instead of purchasing a new Vista version.So this laptop serves my purpose of a home user who doesnt need Vista and lot of RAM.","Finally, the keyboard feel is pretty good, but I\u0027d prefer smaller keys like on most PC laptops.","bye ;] I got this laptop as a graduation gift, and I had it for under a month when it crashed.","There are some laptops that have replaceable video cards.","PC Express slot was a problem due to my PC Cards I owned but it seems all new laptops are now coming with the PC Express slot.Shop your specs and prices but I\u0027m happy with my purchase made in December 2006.","I bought this as my personal laptop about a year ago.","I dont have to worry about viruses or other nonsense like that like I use to have to deal with all the time with my old Dell laptop.","Only the limited RAM prevents this laptop from getting my fifth star.","A notebook or laptop it is not; its big and heavy by todays standards but the performance is fantastic!The Gateway desktop died (will never buy from them again) and couldn\u0027t be brought back to life so I decided to pick up a \u0026quot;notebook\u0026quot;.","First of all: shop around - I bought this same laptop new in summer \u002706 for $600.","Well so I decide to connect to an external monitor and that was working well so I decide to use the monitor and the funny screen, but my laptop it wasn\u0027t anymore portable.","I recently received this laptop and I thought I would like it a lot.","Most other laptops let you use the FDD externally.2.","Sony\u0027s telephone representatives insisted that carrying it in a laptop case was excessive or abusive use and refused to replace it for several months.","You pay for what you get, and Mac\u0027s are the best.So if you want a laptop that is powerful (it\u0027s my all in one solution), simple to use, great battery life (a good solid 4 hours), reliable and secure, brilliant hi resolution screen, this is what you should go for.FYI, I\u0027m a college student who used to be a Windows power user, and now that I use Mac, I don\u0027t have to worry about spyware and virus\u0027s anymore.","But I will certainly consider other manufacturer for my next laptop.","Don\u0027t worry, I will not be pitching MacOS X against Windows XP, I just will compare the hardware design of two laptops which cost about the same (US$900) and are similar size (both have 12.1\" XGA screens).1.","Thank you Great computer for the Price........much better then the Dell laptop I have and costs about the same......Sony....the one and only!!! great computer !!!!! great screen, fast working, nice style, great design....the bad thing for me (and its the same for ever HP model of this kind) is that the lock string attaches to a little hole in the screen panel, and if someday you, or someone pull\u0027s the computer with the lock attached, it will sufer damage .....","For less than $500 I got a great laptop that now everybody in the family uses; definitely worthy.","I expected this laptop to have scratches or some cosmetic issues.","If you\u0027re looking for a gaming laptop, look elsewhere.","So I started looking at Windows laptops.","Love my laptop it comes everywhere with me.","My workis based on computers, and I have never experienced a bettersystem.(+)-Always dependable, never fails to run properly.-Small \u0026 easy to transport.-Interface is extremely easy, good for people new to computers.-Display is great, pictures and videos have never looked this good.-Widgets are really useful!!

i was wrong.","When I bought this laptop, I also bought a USB 802.11b Wireless network adapter for [a price], and in 20 minutes I was surfing the net with no wires attached.","I brought this laptop on Amazon on December 25, 2007.After purchase I have uninstalled all the trail wares and zunkwares from Sony.Solid laptop still it is going strong I buy a new laptop every year, but I don\u0027t upgrade until I find a machine with specs clearly exceeding the last.","The dual-optical bays allow for a DVD-ROM drive so I never have to switch CDs! I get looks of amazement when people see CD trays pop from both sides of the laptop.","Also delete the internet setup programs on the desktopThe specs on the pc are well above average for a $400 - $500 laptop.","After the research I did I would expect a decent gaming machine to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of twice the list price of this laptop.","Even thay have an online checkup for your laptop, where you can scan your several hardware stuff in it, to detect problems in your computer, ONLINE!So they have many ways to get support, not only by phone.","The sound is excellent and the screen is one of the nicest screens I\u0027ve ever seen on a laptop (seen hundreds).","For a company that resists a two-button mouse on the laptop because it\u0027s allegedly too complex, it\u0027s bizarre to build a keyboard that requires you to select 2 keys to do a forward delete or bring up a contextual menu, especially when the 4 modifier keys (fn, ctl, option, and apple) are all small and right next to each other.I didn\u0027t get an appreciation for these annoyances at the store.","Now, I can\u0027t see my screen after opening the laptop more than 25% open.I understand a laptop\u0027s lifespan is approximately 3-4 years but this Toshiba Satellite has had major problems from the start that I had to work around or put up with from the very beginning.","HP laptops are slow compared to other make despite having core 2 duo or Core Duo at 1.83 Mhz and 2 GB memory on my models (check CNET review and it will confirm this observation.).","The plastic on this laptop doesn\u0027t feel that cheap, and is fairly solid.","After exhanging numerous calls and shipping my laptop back to Gateway.","(you can always get the bigger battery also)I have a huge desktop so i wanted a truly mobile laptop, this is it webcam, tablet pc, media player, portable DVD cd mp3 player.","I am happy user until now although it cost more than other PC laptop.","(-;The laptop is nice and quiet except intermittently the cpu fan will come on for no reason.Overall the laptop feels very solid and the only thing I have not really tested are the battery discharge times.The only OS I tested this with is Ubuntu Linux and everything worked out of the box except for the flash card reader; There is supposedly a driver in the works for that.","I did put a Speck protective skin on it, and blocked the \"STEAL ME - NOW!\" light on the back of the lid with the thinnest aluminum foil I could find, so it looks from the outside like a two-year old, $350 laptop.","The screen is bright and there are no bubbles or discrepancies of any kind, and the fact that the LCD panel is on one giant hinge basically ensures you won\u0027t get a flimsy hinge (common to Dell laptops, with two small hinges positioned at each end of the panel), and the battery is sufficient for small tasks (excel sheets, writing essays, watching movies on a plane, etc).","I will buy another Compaq and pass this one down to my daughter.Update: 1 Year later - this laptop is still going strong and I would like a newer model but what for? This unit is going to be hard to beat.","I had my doubts about HP because I had never bought HP Laptop.","Considering that this is the newest and the greatest laptop from Sony, I wonder how in the world the R\u0026amp;D folks could ever decide on configuring this drive to the computer.* Max out at 512m memory is just NOT good enough.","I also upgraded the memory this year from 1Gb to 2Gb, which was also very easy--the most diffcult part was making sure I got the right memory cards that were compatible with my laptop, so I had a \"geek\" freind help me with that.","I have been a long time fan of Sony technology, and in my lifetime have purchased 5 Sony PC\u0027s (two desktops, three laptops in total).","I realize you are not supposed to comment on others posts here, but having this laptop for over a year now, I wanted to clarify some information in response to Jeremy Lamb and Javier\u0027s posts.First, Jeremy.","Basic laptops even HP\u0027s higher series most come with an ATI Radeon 200M which u can\u0027t even put on medium resolution 800x600 for Doom 3 or Farcry.","Although I\u0027ve sold a lot of Sony laptop, this one is the first sony I bought for myself.The item intergraded most of the latest technology and feature of laptop, such as bluetooth, webcam with built-in Mic, 4.2 pound weight, 13.3 widescreen.","I imagine the digital out on the front of the laptop could be used with a surround system, although I am not sure and its a mini plug out, not an RCA or optical out like I am used to seeing.","I have the laptop for almost two years ago.","Bottom line, this is a powerful, fast laptop with nice configurations and very low price.","You will need a replacement keypad (check ebay, they sell lots of them (hmm... wonder why?)).2) screen issues: one laptop had broken screen hinges, one has dead pixels, and one has a broken screen from rough handling (ok maybe this one not all their fault).3) broken power supplies: the adapters have cords that break and split easily.","The lock to keep laptop close, has hook big as fishing hook.","If the power does not grab you, the quality and overall competence of this machine will win you over.Panther (OSX.3) is rock stable, I added memory and am using it for DVD movies and digital imaging which all works perfectly.If I had one complaint it would be that the battery last longer than the 3 1/2 hours I am getting burning this machine up.If you own any small laptop, you would do well to take a look at this baby.","The 2GB RAM limitations makes this a somewhat weak performer with Vista.If you want a decent business laptop, or a viable desktop alternative, then this one is a decent choice (though there are better).If you want to play high-end games, do much video editing, or any other graphics intensive applications....then it aint.At almost 8lbs, this laptop is definitely not travel-friendly! It tends to run a bit on the warm side too, so it\u0027s more of a \u0027counter-top\u0027 than a laptop.The glossy surfaces look pretty, but attract a LOT of dust and fingerprints.","I had planned to use this laptop for product demonstrations away from home.","If you are considering the Compaq Presario 2100 AMD Athlon XP-M laptop, go for it.","Laptop is fast, performs beautifuly and has great visual properties.","The laptop also looks very sleek and stylish.","The first time it fell from a table as my kids were watching a DVD movie from the laptop.","lucky that i took insurance with the laptop for 3 years so i am making use of if, but most of the time it stays with the service people as it gives problems every month.","I purchased the laptop for my brother lives in Africa, so I sent the laptop to him as soon as I received.","I like to use my laptop in my lap (surprise!), propped up on my thighs and have the headphones on.","Perhaps he had it configured with a little less power, but mine works as well as any laptop I\u0027ve ever used.This is my second laptop, but the first one was a small 486 I bought because the size was cool.","(I talked to them on the phone and I\u0027m not shipping my laptop) I definitely don\u0027t want to do that so now I have to buy another laptop.","Then again...PC laptops usually come with a weak 256MB of ram and we all know that is horrific.Review:This actually will run windoze exceptionally well.","This laptop has given me nothing but issues over the 2 years I had it.","It does run hot, and the battery lasts about 2.5 hours, but the light weight and nice speed and wifi make up for everything.Get yourself a Mareware case designed for the small Apple laptop.","Let me start out with saying that this is my 3rd laptop that I bought at a local retailer and the first that I had to return.","This laptop has a great screen, like most Sony laptops, but it\u0027s very bulky and heavy and not the easiest to lug around.","Within A year the 2 laptops I purchased both went bad.","I will only discuss my personal experience with a laptop I still love and I would very much miss if it had to be replaced with some other brand.I still like my Thinkpad, mainly because of its design simplicity and because of the little red mouse-emulator knob in the middle of the keyboard.","As for this Sony laptop, I had installed LightRoom and other photo CPU intensive softwares and it doesn\u0027t seem to slow down by noticeable amount.One thing that do not like about this Sony laptop is that they pre-installed a bunch of useless software.","The difference I noticed from my other laptop is that there is a lack of ports which might add to the fact that it has an incredibly simple design and that it uses only what it needs.","I was also very happy to see no dead pixels, something which seems to plague many or most laptops.","Dont buy Sony! Support honesty, dont buy Sony! sony sucks..i paid this laptop 1700 dolars and it s broken 3 times in a year..first time they fixed and it broken again with same problem but they want 700 dolars for repair...no audio no more playing dvd s ..i m tired of recovery ...stay away from sony...","It runs Vista Premium with Aero like a dream and everything works fine, no glitches found whatsoever with Vista or the Laptop.","Secondly, the battery life is not good enough for a truly portable machine (and not even close to many of the other laptops out there).","Its cheap, its got everything a reasonable person could want from a laptop.","This laptop, however, runs fairly fast and basically everything else about it is positive.","This laptop is pretty decent (especially for the price) for the first two of my purposes, but for gaming, it was way, way below par.","They seemed to be the best deal each time we were in the market for a new laptop, but don\u0027t waste your money.","After a couple of weeks using it I had to send it for technical service, due to malfunctioning in burning and connecting to internet.After I got it back It was all perfect, although It is the most noisy laptop I\u0027ve ever seen, I enjoyed watching DVDs on this great screen.Recently though, It has been turning off suddenly, because it gets extremely hot.","It now looks like there are many folks who have the same problem with this particular laptop.","Quite honestly, I can\u0027t tell the difference between a Blu-Ray movie (one is provided gratis as part of the laptop package) and a regular DVD movie.","I brought back again and well I persuaded my wife to try again with the same model and company, I started the computer and installing the programs I realized after several intents that the CPU was damaged, so I brought back again and got a Compaq, more heavy, a little bit more expensive but it is working perfectly and smoothly.SO DO NOT BUY, AVERATEKOR BEFORE BUY PLEASE THINK ABOUT THAT:WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT A COMPUTER MODEL PRESENTs THREE DIFFERENT HARDWARE DEFECTS AND THIS OCCURS TO THE SAME BUYER?I HOPE YOU TAKE THE RIGHT DECISION!!!DO NOT BUY ITTHE ONE STAR IS THE LOWEST ONE BUT I THINK IT DOES NOT DESERVE ANY STAR AT ALL, TOO BAD how do i resent this cf-51 i\u0027ve unfortunately bought? well, let me vant here:1) the design: it\u0027s probably the worst laptop you could ever find in the $1,200.00-$1,600.00 range.","My laptop that uses Parallel Desktop to allow me to use PC is faster than those with PowerPC uses Virtual PC.4.","On the other hand, it\u0027s just a matter of time before all airlines start having plugs for laptops in all cabins.","It was packaged very safely and worked right out of the box.People have told me that buying the 14.1 inch iBook was a waste since I bought my laptop from circuit city for $650 this laptop has a beautiful 15.4 widescreen display it has so many features the speakers sound great and the internet runs extremely quickly, overall it runs extremely quick and although it only has a 1gb of ram it runs just as good as my highly equipped desktop.","After this experience, I will don\u0027t think I will go back to Sony again.PROS:* Stylish looks, all aluminum palm rest (but cheap lid design)* Weights 4lb 3.4oz (I measured it with my postal scale)* Intel Duo Core @ 1.83GHz* 1GB of DDR2 RAM* Huge 120GB HDD (5400RPM)* First dual graphics laptop* GeForce Go 7400 (top of the line \"thin-n-light\" graphics processor from NVIDIA)* Nice little built-it webcam (but very low quality videos and pics)* Very bright screen (but had 3 defective pixels in a row)* Runs very cool and very quiet (even when playing 3D games)* Can play Dungeon Siege II at 1024x768 with medium setting at around 40-60fpsCONS:* Cheap looking lid surface (feels like sand paper)* No locking hinge for LCD screen* Annoying external Wi-Fi antenna (even without GPRS option)* Makes loud-whining noise when playing DVDs with labels (i.e. Memorex, Neato)* Battery jiggles and doesn\u0027t feel secured in place* Huge AC adapter weights exactly 1 pounds and is bigger than Dell\u0027s normal adapter* Battery life is a little disappointing (2h:45m on performance mode and 3h:15m on stamina mode) Let me start with a simple disclaimer, first I worked for Apple (a long time ago) for 11 years, I also worked for Microsoft for 6 years and I\u0027m pretty comfortable in both camps but I truly love Apple for it\u0027s design and combined hardware/software implementations.","I have had this laptop for about a year now, and I love it.","We now have nearly 100 computers from IBM laptops to G5s and I\u0027ve used Mac laptops since I bought the ill-fated \u0026quot;Portable.\"","I\u0027ve transferred all the files from both of my desktops to this laptop and the desktops are now collecting dust.","It uses the case to deliver the sound and is very impressive (for laptops of course)That is all, I was doubtful in the beginning and almost went with a premium HP.","I hate being told that \u0026quot;you can\u0027t talk to anyone but me and I refuse to help you in any way at all\u0026quot;.The service center is STILL in possession of the laptop.","To switch the laptop ON, you have to wait until its completely cool down (approximately an hour after you switching it off).","If you buy this laptop, be sure to upgrade your memory with the same manufacturer.","My sister paid 1,200 for hers and she is way richer then me, and admits she likes my laptop way better than hers.","I HIGHLY recommend this computer if you\u0027re looking for a laptop to game on.","I purchased this laptop about 6 months ago and it has been awesome!

For I previously owned another piece of Gateway trash! Fool me twice: shame on me!Gateway laptops will have the biggest hard-drives, the fastest processors, and and the greatest memory with huge, wide-screen, crystal clear monitors to boot! All this for a fraction of a high-end brand.","Desktops consist of the keyboard, the monitor itself, the mouse, and other accessories.","I\u0027m so fickle - hence me balancing a multitude of ladies.When I got the box, I opened the package and made sure I kept the insert between the monitor and keyboard.","My second tour there was as a First Sergeant and stationed in Central Baghdad and I was able to set it up and not move it the entire time until the monitor fried again.Now that I was lucky enough to find and purchase the very last new VGN-A290 in the US, I intend to send the older one in and have it completely refurbished.","The monitor turned off in the middle of operation, and it would not turn back on for longer than 30 seconds.","Compare that to the matte screens used by other companies (such as the HP4900 series or most View sonic monitors) and think about where you will be using it.","An external computer monitor must also be HDCP compliant for BD movies to play.","Later in the day turned it on and it sign into the network automatically.- The 4 in 1 integrated card reader is very convenient to transfer files between this and other computers.- Another great feature, specially because you don\u0027t get it for 750 is a 15.4 widescreen.- 4 USB ports, 1 Fire Wire, 1 Video S and a monitor Port- The software included is brand name and well known, including Mc Afee Spyware (30 day trial), Norton Internet Security (90 Day Trial) Nero Express 6.0, Power DVD, Office Trial in case you don\u0027t want to buy it you can settle for Works 8, which seem more complete than the previous version.- Lots of memory a 60, yes you\u0027re reading correctly 60 GB Hard Drive, not a lot by today standards, but most notebooks in its price range have only 40 GB.-Dual Layer multi format DVD+/-RW with up to 8X DVD +/-RI\u0027m really pleased with this purchase, and forgot to mention it looks stylish.","An LCD monitor makes the DualView feature extend the desktop to twice the normal size.","I find I must run Task Manager to monitor for programs that are not responding.","I didn\u0027t buy it for Lightscribe, but when I first tried out my laptop, I thought I got an added bonus! But alas, Booo to HP for blatantly implying it has LightScribe.Ports: Ports are a bit limited, but it has everything most people could want, TV-output, monitor output, ethernet, modem, wifi.","(The battery life stinks when playing games though - I only got about one hour when playing NFS III)*Screen Size:The screen is huge - almost as big as a 17\" CRT monitor.","Yet the computer part was fine, I could work in MS Word if I picked the blue screen option, and I could attach an external monitor for working on the web.","I would not describe the unit I received as in \"very good\" condition, as monitor shows some damage in small areas (near the bottom) that are visible when powered on.","I was afraid that if this persisted overtime that it would permanently damage this part of the monitor.","XP (+ATI X200M) did not show 1680x1050 resolution as being available until monitor was configured as second display w/extended desktop.","It should just turn off LCD monitor and do nothing else (that\u0027s T40\u0027s behavior).","I mainly watch videos and listen to music with it, and these speakers and the monitor are probably the best around.","Maybe a voice activated machine that can cope with an 80+ year old\u0027s idiosyncrasies that is able to read minds also.............:) If this machine weren\u0027t buggy then it would be a very good value for $999, given the DVI out capability which lets you run the machine closed with an external monitor -- AFAIK no other x86 laptop has this cool feature at anywhere near this pricepoint, plus the integrated bluetooth and videocam.I aso like the glossy screen, especially with the PC/TV screen gamma (Apple\u0027s default gamma setting is a bit too washed out for me).Unfortunately, after a week I\u0027ve found some bugs with the MacBook:1) Same electronic noise issue when the CPUs are idle as with the MBP (opening Photo Booth does cut out the noise substantially).2) Machine was running very hot \u0026 (worse) was \"mooing\" -- the fan would come on and then go off repeatedly, making a highly annoying noise each time.","Expensive to upgrade, 1 GB of memory runs about $120 as opposed to DDR2 which is about $70.Overall, if you plan on using one monitor, doing minimal gaming, and have the know how to take apart the laptop (voiding the warrenty), remove the heatsync, apply a better quality thermal compound and put the whole thing back together, this is the laptop for you.","Overall, I think I got a good deal though I\u0027ll have to keep an eye out on any changes to the screen\u0027s visibility (if damage worsens) and will update any new developments accordingly.Also, I gave this seller 3 stars due to the shipping snafu and damaged monitor.","A light shines down from the top of the monitor with the click of two keys.","Very small pressures on the monitor or the back cover could cause damages of the display.","The monitor is 12.1\", but with LCD prices dropping, I guess I\u0027ll buy one soon.","The entire hinge has always seemed a bit fragile with a fair amount of play in the the monitor joint.","Very nice.You can also turn off the back-light in the screen if you want to use the computer with an external monitor.","The PB\u0027s graphics processor has no trouble driving my monitor at that resolution.","What it thrives on is what\u0027s inside.The Screen: I was originally considering getting a large monitor for the Macbook Pro, so I could easily edit documents and pictures.","this machine has done wonders, the screen size is hardly noticable since the resolution and sharpness are far better than any 14 inch monitor dell makes.","All the drivers (except the monitor, which shows as Generic non-PnP) are available for download.This is a wonderful machine.","You can get good 3rd party batteries for less than $40 that do not have this issue.Currently I own a Mac Pro with 4TB Raided internal Hard drive space (4 2TB hard drives), 14 GB 1066 MHz DDR3 RAM, 2 x 2.93 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon processor (8 core model), ATI Radeon HD 4870 512 MB graphics card, a 1920 x 1080 HD monitor, with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74).","This proprietary wireless connection point connected to the back of the monitor and did not use any of the USB ports or PCMIA Card Slots.","Also, built in, are 3 USB ports, a fire wire port, an external monitor port, an S-video port for connecting to a TV, stereo microphones, and a modem (for times of desperation, I suppose.","The viewing angle is sufficient, although not great (certainly not 170 degree as many LCD monitors exhibit), but better than T40\u0027s, which gets a very narrow viewing angel.","In the four months that I\u0027ve owned it, it has already had to be sent in for repairs twice, once for problems with the wireless card and once for a dead LCD monitor.","So maybe you could be better serverd by a 12\" (easier to be carry) and a good external monitor.","I contacted Sony support and following is an abbreviated version of our discussion:Problem: I just want to confirm that I will be able to connect the PC with the Blu-Ray drive to an HDTV monitor via the HDMI connection.","There are two big scratches that are on either side of the monitor, which comes from the part of the laptop it meets when its closed.Even better, i once apparently picked up the laptop the wrong way and it nearly cracked in half.","( mfctr sggst\u0027d retail was $1599 )Been very happy with this laptop.Have used for surfing the web, email, pix editing, Excel, Word, monitoring remote-surveillance video, remote data back-ups from office, and on-line poker ( multi-tables).Have even hooked up to 42\" HDTV (LCD) via VGA output to show slide-shows, DVD\u0027s and interesting web-sites.Have lugged the 10 lb\u0027er on road-trips a few times.","The screen is sharp and impressive, the battery life is good (not quite the 6 hours advertised, but a solid 4-4.5 hours), its incredibly portable, the full-size keyboard is easy to use, and I\u0027ve easily integrated the iBook at home for the full desktop experience with a regular monitor, wireless mouse, and external drive (to make up for the small hard drive).Having to buy Microsoft Office was definitely a negative of the iBook, but it was definitely worth the extra cost.","It\u0027s small, light (compare it to a Macbook that has the same screen size but a pound heavier!), it has a decent video card (I would not mind better, it has 64 Mb dedicated, plus another 64 sharing, but most laptops this size don\u0027t have even that!), it has a wifi card that is extremely well supported - I installed Linux on this laptop - works beautifully, I can not only connect to wifi networks, I can also monitor traffic in promiscuous mode AT THE SAME TIME as being connected to the net, I can even make it an access point.","Luckily I monitored the tracking status and was able to re-direct the delivery myself by contacting Fedex to report physical address change.","Also, my monitor occasionaly flickers.","It\u0027s substantial and comfortable to use with a 17\" monitor and extended keyboard.","I have owned this noteook for about 1 week...and I love it so much that I am starting to ditch my P2-400 desktop (with a 19\" Trinitron Monitor, which is a lot bigger than this 12.1 TFT).","[The hard-drive, the monitor, the CPU and the wireless \"G\"-card are performing very well, though.]","I have never even seen a desktop monitor that compares to this thing, and that is precisely why I paid about 2000.00 for my dv8280.","(Passowrd logins, launching applications using different fingerprints ... yes, you can actually give Outlook the middle finger !! No pun intended.)Apart from the battery life, which is only about 3 hrs - (fine by me); everything else works to spec.The best feature, which is somewhat hidden, is a dual display feature of the graphics card in the system - which means, if you connect an external monitor, you can use use the laptop display combined with the external display as an extended desktop.Screen is clear and images are really nice, haven\u0027t used the Ilink port so far.","The use of an external monitor is still quite primitive.a) You can not move the dock on the external monitor(unless you do not want to use only the external one).b) You can not have the menubar on both monitors at the same time.c) The X11 client will open every window always on the main monitor.d) The procedure to use the external monitor keeping close the powerbookis quite boring.These days the new version (1.6GB) appeared.","I shopped for a 17 inch monitor and was very attracted to the looks of this Toshiba.","The very top of the monitor has a 1mm bright white line.","What it thrives on is what\u0027s inside.The Screen: I was originally considering getting a large monitor for the Macbook Pro, so I could easily edit documents and pictures.","I then tried to open the computer and found that they failed to hook the release button for the monitor back up.","I plugged it into a desktop monitor and was surprised to see it supported up to 1600 x 1200 resolution... and that was just in 32MB video mode.Pros:- The price.- Small and light, a notebook that is actually the size of a notebook!- Performance, no complaints here! 512MB RAM, 40GB HD, 64MB video, and fast enough for anything I\u0027m likely to do with it.- DVD+CD-RW combo.Cons:- The USB ports could be in a better spot.","I did pick-up the \"Ultrabase\" which functions like a docking station to plug in your full size monitor, keyboard and other perhipherals.","I have to use external monitor and docking station at work (see below).- The speakers.","but if you can live without the bells and whistles, this is a fine little machine.out of the box, you get a 15\" monitor, a dvd-cdrw drive, 256mb ram, and a 20gb hard drive.","You can stretch it a little by dimming the monitor as dark as you can stand, but it\u0027s pretty unlikely you\u0027ll make it through a full-length movie on battery alone--never mind if you want to work for a full coast-to-coast flight.","It has 3 high speed USB 2.0 ports, A firewire port, LAN and Phone ports, a 4-card reader (can read SD cards and Sony memory sticks...both of which I have), DVD/CD-Burner, Display Monitor port, Convenient 802.11G outside on/off slide switch.","The screen is great, very bright and clear, much like a desktop hgh end LCD monitor and the 17 inch size is great as you can see a full two pages of info, great for looking at two web pages at once.","I got 2GB and the machine blazes! I now use my MacBook as my desktop machine as well - it sits closed behind a 20\" monitor.","A word to the wise: I used what I believe to be a very screen-friendly screen cleaner on the Sony (I\u0027ve used for the past 5 years to clean CRT and LCD monitors and laptop screens.","A real sign of intelligence on this design is that when you close the monitor the speakers are then still located outside the case.","I love it! I purchased apple\u0027s \"mini DVI\" to DVI adapter, the apple bluetooth mouse and keyboard and use this laptop (with the clam shell closed) with my Viewsonic VA1912wb 19 inch monitor when I want more screen real estate (I didn\u0027t even have to install drivers for the bluetooth mouse, bluetooth keyboard, or monitor...the computer recognized those devices and they just worked.)","I travel a lot and take lots of digital pictures, so this is perfect in terms of portability and performance.Pros:Small form factorHuge hard driveGreat battery life (avg. 3 hrs)DVD burnerSD/MMC card readerExternal monitor supportCons:No floppy driveNo manual or support documentationNo original discs for installed software (for backup)No IEEE 1394 ports (FireWire) I own a dual core laptop with 2 gigs ram and a fast hardrive and was looking for something to take notes one, a small tabletthat was small enough to carry in my laptop bag with my laptop, but large enough to take notes on.So far this device has exceeded my expectations.I have taken notes on it for 2 days now with MSFT\u0027s onenote loaded.The machine keeps up with my writing.I loaded all of MSFT office enterprise edition on it for the fun of it and Lotus notes 7 for my corp email.I am trying the new windows live mail instead of using outlook for my personal email.","It started right up out of the box and is also great with the mini-dock and a monitor.","The vaunted Blu-Ray DVD player will absolutely not function if the computer is attached to a remote monitor/tv/projector.","On the one occasion I spoke with Toshiba to look for updates they were EXCELLENT!As a desktop I have connected a 17 inch Samsung LCD monitor and wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse along with a USB hub making it a simple matter of connecting or removing 2 plugs.All in all a great machine, my only complaint was( No Track Ball ); a left over issue from using and IBM but solved by carrying a optical mouse in my bag.","How odd that HP Support will tell you that they don\u0027t have the drivers.While I had XP Home for a couple of days the one thing I did notice is the Wireless network \u0026quot;Monitor\u0026quot; would not report a connection correctly.","I\u0027ve had to reformat the hard drive 9 times since owning it and now the monitor no longer works.","I imagine that it will not cut the mustard with 3D games for very long (32MB is certainly on the low end of video ram), but I shouldn\u0027t think that many people will buy this computer to play games.All in all, this is a great choice for students or executives who want a stylish, powerful computer to take with them on the road (In fact, it has some sort of proprietary monitor-switching technology for presentations, but I haven\u0027t tried it out yet).","It obviated the need for a separate monitor.","My only gripe about the volume and brightness buttons are that there is no on-screen meter for either -- so you don\u0027t know how low the volume is, or how bright the monitor is, you just have to hit min or max.The 3 usb ports are sort of scattered around the machine.","It worked with a remote monitor, so the problem was obviously the laptop screen.","It isn\u0027t a huge problem for me, but the iBook does not have the extended desktop feature, when using an external monitor, that the Powerbook enjoys.Overall, the iBook 1.07 GHZ G4 system is an amazingly portable notebook computer with acceptable performance.","The operating system is beautiful and runs smoothly even when multitasking.When I\u0027m at home, I connect the PB to a Dell 21\" LCD monitor running at 1600x1200 resolution, and a wireless keyboard and mouse.","He\u0027s got space for more inside his casing, which is more than you can say for newer machines, that are just meant to be thrown out after a year.Another bonus is the full-size keyboard, the two types of mouse (a touchpad and the pointing stick, the latter of which has a middle button which I\u0027m sure does SOMETHING but I don\u0027t know what), the very sturdy mouse-buttons (they\u0027re loud but push down satisfyingly), the status lights at the bottom of the monitor, and the little white LED on the top of the monitor, that illuminates the keyboard in the dark.","Just connect your monitor, wired or wireless keyboard/mouse and everything you should connect to USB/Firewire ports and you\u0027re done!- The keyboard as well as the computer itself it\u0027s veeeeery well designed to be used with your thumbs.","Pop out the keyboard, set-up the mouse and essential turn the rest of the laptop into a monitor.","The monitor is excellent and even bright enough when I am in theoffice or outside.","When you connect the replicator to a LCD monitor, you do not get video on the monitor when you play video files using real-player.I won\u0027t not buy any VAIO laptop computers in the future.","2 years later the monitor went out of it, so I went on line and ordered a 17\" Dell computer.","Again, shame on you Apple for not anticipating the need to output to something besides a computer monitor with a laptop.4.","DVD viewing is a wondrous experience even at full screen; who needs a big screen TV? And while I will probably never mate my 1905-S301 with an external monitor, it\u0027s nice to have the ATI Radeon video card with 16MB of DDR video memory at my disposal.","Then again, the MacBook Pro comes with a graphics card that can drive an external (additional) 21\" monitor without breaking a sweat, and that *is* enough for most coding needs.","The real test will be producing music on battery power which will be much more CPU intensive.The wide screen monitor is beautiful, and I had no trouble setting up my old CRT for using dual monitors for added workspace.","- Great size, form factor, weight, and performance- I use the laptop for pre-sales demos, development work, and services work- The screen and keyboard are a bit small so a monitor and keyboard are necessary when at your desk Great size for travel, lightweight and fast.I upgraded from a previous portable Sony Vaio and it is worth the change.","I\u0027ve already have a P4 desktop with two 19\" monitors.","On the PoweBook, however, it is spring loaded, so that it automatically retracts into the monitor when not in use.","This makes this laptop a real pain to plug in to an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc on a regular basis and even when you do, you have a lot of unsightly cables shooting out from the sides.","Also when you connect the dock to an external monitor you would get a \"widescreen look\" with black bars on top and bottom.","The DVD capabilities are awesome for trips or to watch movies at a desk, beyond that you might want to get a seperate monitor so you can see the image a little bit better from a distance.","The second time, the monitor developed vertical colored lines due to another hardware problem.","For example, I recently started using speech recognition software to speed up my work (a very large program), and the program would not even load on battery power, though it loaded and runs fine on AC power.Also, as another reviewer has mentioned, I too have had a problem with the monitor hinge cracking.","This notebook is really amazing.The only thing may fail is that it starts to break, specially if you hold it with only one hand on the corner.Also the backlit of the monitor may fail after some years of use (the flexible cable ruptures).","The keys have a nice typing touch, screen is excellent although I don\u0027t like the glare from a shiny plastic face on the monitor that disturbed others during a meeting.My little cell phone has wi-fi and that was another thing this had with a radar sensor that will look for a signal.","I have a averatec 5110H model laptop.PLEASE DONT BUY anything from averatec.The laptops monitor had a problem only after a week i bought.The customer service is VERY VERY bad.They take 2 weeks time to repair/replace anything.This is during the warranty period(1 yr).Thereafter,if anything goes wrong you have to ship it back to them,as they dont sell any of their parts outside.Now, this time they took 4 weeks time to repair.Compare this with DELL/MAC.its a 3 days reponse time.","The powerful processor, graphics, memory and the arsenal of connectivity options make this a perfect contender for that spot where you monitor now sits.","There is indeed a setting for 1600x1200, but this merely allows the 1400x1050 screen to pan across the larger area.You may also want to know that the 2715 has 16M video RAM vs the 2710\u0027s 8M, which woudl be important if you are expecting to use dual-monitor desktop mode. for those who long for a small, light, beautiful, powerful laptop like me, apple ibook g4 by all means satisfies all the needs! it is extremely beautiful, with a very human approach.","Buy a good LCD monitor for about $500.2.","big screen so you definitely don\u0027t need to hook up an outside monitor and very clear screen.","Toshiba tech support will not talk to you unless you give them a credit card and I have found that to replace the monitor (part alone) is $400 +.","IBM Software does a decent job monitor the system for you.","wiped with an alcohol prep pad, and good as new!switching between regular output/dual monitor output/external monitor is *too* easy..","Compared to my desktop my desktop monitor looks dim.","However, the image on the laptop itself is the best image I\u0027ve ever seen on a laptop computer and way better then the image on my viewsonic flat panel monitor! The machine is whisper quite.","The large monitor is great also! I bought this computer for my Mom use.","I was severely dissapointed when, a few days after I had begun using it, I noticed that the \"metallic\" outer shell over the monitor had already become terribly scratched up by rubbing against a plastic binder in my bag.","What a joke!

If you have to have ONE computer you probably want to strongly consider a PC.","I also occasionally notice a momentary slight flicker on the LCD monitor as the computer is thinking hard.","Web pages and computer programs load faster than ever as well.I had my doubts about the 13\" monitor when I bought my MacBook, but I have to say that they have been disproven.","After reviewing offerings from Dell, Ibm, HP and IBM determined that for the money the Toshiba was the best if my budget was less than $2000.Good features: (1) speed, (2) everything works, (3) good screen; (4) very good video card, I run the native screen plus a 24\" dell monitor with no problem.Poor features: Keyboard layout is strange.","The Widescreen Monitor is beautiful, Widescreen movies playback crisp and in Widescreen; the size makes web pages look better, my Web Site looks pretty sweet in Widescreen.I just bought this for work and have taken it on the road, so far so good however I will update the review it things change.","It has every feature and port needed to meet all your entertainment needs whether it\u0027s downloading music or playing videos and the widescreen HD monitor looks as good as my Samsung HDTV.The only negative is with getting a 17-inch widescreen you also are getting 8 pounds of weight.","I bought it like 2 months ago and I\u0027ve been using it and it just works great, the 2.0 GHZ processor is awsome, really fast, and the dvd/cd burner and the 120 gb are great too !! the monitor size is perfect and really cool graphics, really recommend buying it , the prize is worth it.","I wrote my doctoral dissertation on it, using the docking station to hook up to a large monitor and standard keyboard after coming home from the university every day.","The review would have been more favorable earlier, but you got to consider in terms of today\u0027s technology, would people want to get this laptop, so that is what I based my review on.Pros:------decent speakers for notebook speakers-decent sound quality on headphones-fast enough processor-great feel on keyboard \u0026 touchpad-external monitor support-PC card expansion slot-screen is bright and sharp-decent budget laptop I guess...-fairly rugged and durable, reliableCons:------glossy screen glare annoying in bright places-uneven backlighting becomes annoyingly obvious when watching DVD movies in a dark place-wireless card in the laptop is intermittent, not much of a problem when just surfing the web, but a major issue when using streaming video/audio content, or playing online games, which both require a constant connection-short battery life even on minimal use-slow \u0026 limited RAM really drasticaly affects performance, lots of page file usage (over 500MB at times!!!) makes things slow when loading or switching applications.","I also have a dock and a 21\" widescreen monitor.","The touchpad requires very minimal pressure to operate, and the left and right control buttons are large and well placed.Three USB ports, one Firewire port, a parallel port, external monitor port, PCMCIA slots (2), and standard audio ports are provided.","I am very gentle with my laptop and the monitor went out.","It has all the depth and color richness of a regular monitor.","The large 16\u0026quot; screen and high resolution (1400x1050) is great, and with an extenral monitor we can go to 1600x1200 which is is essential for us.","Not a big deal to me b/c that the setting I keep all my monitors at.In conclusion, I strongly recommend you purchase the deluxe extended warranty which will cover all issues.","Lets just say I have this laptop on all the time and it does not get hot!I can notice right off the bat the dispay is beautiful and bright when it is home I hook up a monitor and turn the laptop screen off.","supported dual monitors (your laptop screen + another monitor) right out of the box without a hiccup.","It should be on the side.Third: If you work on the go -- like off your lap, the distance between the power transformer and the laptop is too short.Forth: If you work on the go -- like off your lap, the power plug on the side of the computer looks like it could cause some serious damage to the laptop if hit slightly the wrong way.Fifth: If you work on the go -- like off your lap, the hinge for the monitor does not go back far enough.","I use it both with and without a docking station, and with both single/double monitors, both 10BASE-T and wireless.I spilled half a bottle of Orange Crush all over the keypad while it was running (YIKES!), turned it on its side to dump out as much liquid as I could, and it just kept on going as if nothing had happened! Turned out to have a clear plastic membrane underneath the keypad.","Controls for the laptop LCD are also very limited, which made monitor calibration really difficult.Another major problem is the battery life.","They even sell notebook monitor protectors for upwards of 10 bucks if you look around the net.After turning it on, you get asked to register some products such as Symantec Antivirus and other stuff.","Every time I would use Windows Explorer in any way, the stupid WINDOWS program that supposedly \"protects my computer by monitoring how each program is using memory\" notice that my memory was being used \"incorrectly\".","The monitor alone will amaze you and you will NOT find anything better..","I haven\u0027t had any monitor problems like other users have stated and I hope I don\u0027t run into that problem!*Speakers:I can\u0027t really say much about the speakers except that I like their location which is at either side of the keyboard and thus gets out of your way when you lay your wrists on the laptop.","I know it is recommended not to leave the laptop plugged in while not in use (It can damage the monitor).","The 15.4\" (diagonal) screen, actually 13\" x 8\" (1.625:1) has to be navigated using a 60mm x 45mm (1.3:1) touch-pad, which is about the aspect ratio of my old desk-top monitor.","Also for a time I had SuSe Linux 8.0 dual booting no problems except it ran very hot, uninstalled it because with a 20GB hard drive things got cramped real fast.I started out with 8mb video and 256mb RAM and upgraded to 32mb video \u0026amp; 512mb RAM, bought the port replicator and a PCMCIA-USB 2.0 Card and have been using my 2700US as a desktop relacement for a little over a year now flawlessly, except for a problem using an external monitor until I upgraded the video driver for dual monitor support.","The receptivity level is great! The note taker is cool...you jot down a note and record as well if you wish.The additional side buttons on the monitor are great alternates for the regular function buttons.","I have been told that the monitor is often the first thing to go on a laptop, but less than a year and already having problems???? Also, the paint that is used does not hold up very well.","The widescreen monitor is beautiful to look at.","You can check the packet flow in the Activity Monitor in Utilities to see what works best.(9) Wireless reception does not seem to be a strength of the two Airs that I use.","If you are curious go check out this notebook or Sony\u0027s desktop LCD monitors in your local electronics store.","When I work at my desk and write documentation and presentations, I will prefer to have the Sony plugged into my 19\" monitor, USB keyboard, USB mouse and Ethernet.","So Not sure if its bad design or just Vista being a hog.The notebook also NEVER remembers my dual monitor settings and have to reset it after each and every reboot (And I\u0027m up to date with a new driver that came out last week - go figure)So bottom line is you get what you pay for, I guess Great price \u003d absolutely terrible HP support + sub-par performance.This will be my last HP purchase - I made a big mistake shopping solely on price and features.","After several calls and interminable hours to prove that the problem wasn\u0027t fixable, they sent me a box by overnight shipping with return paid, and within a few days I had it back with a new motherboard.I put a temp. monitor program on it, and found that the CPU was running about 35-40 C, and occasionally over 60 or 70 C, which is way too high.","But when you can easily augment the onboard hard drive with a USB external drive, what difference does it make?The biggest asset here is the 15.4\" display, in a word used by another reviewer, AWESOME! Even better, I\u0027ve plugged my old display into the video port, using it to extend my desktop across both monitors.","I am able to browse the Internet in any room of my house - well worth the extra $100 or so.I have the 12-inch monitor, but that was because Apple hadn\u0027t released the 15-inch in the new style when I made my purchase.","The solution offered by HP Service was you could buy another monitor $200.00 but oh gosh since the problem apparently was the heating up problem those also went belly up because the real issue was not admitted to or ever resolved by HP.","If anyone knows how to use monitor-out port to make it tv-out port, please let me know at boevik9000@hotmail.com I really like this tablet.","It left a scratch on the monitor when closed.","The resolution and quality of the image of the monitor is excellent, probably the best feature of the computer.HP support is good for really inexperienced users but can be very frustrating for people who know about computers.Take home message: This is wonderful for people on the go who will use this product for about a year and then replace it with a new one --\u003e expensive palmtop I bought this computer in January.","Now I almost never use my desktop PC.*Dual Monitor Support:This is great for people who want to make power point presentations from there laptop.","Actually, the outer glass of the screen seems to be only a protection, while the real monitor is below, so you have no direct contact with it.There is no bluetooth on this fellow, but I bought a plug-and-play pccard adapter and installed it to the external slot available on the Toshiba R15.","Also, the second monitor connector is loose and the colors get screwy.","The thing is sexy.4) Monitor - X-Brite and wide screen.","I am able to browse the Internet in any room of my house - well worth the extra $100 or so.I have the 12-inch monitor, but that was because Apple hadn\u0027t released the 15-inch in the new style when I made my purchase.","Graphics appear with more presence, ambience and continuity, making the TFT superior to CRT monitors.","When using the PB as a desktop, I would prefer to have the monitor port and power port available in the rear.","The problem is obvious on mine, I have a good eyesight - and depend on my PowerBook for graphical work, and earn a living... so scrolling diagonal lines on light grey backgrounds behind text, scanline texture surimposed to any graphic, is not an option for me and is giving me headaches literally as well as figuratively (pun intended) and I sincerely don\u0027t know what to do as refund, resale, switching to a 17\" is not exactly what I want to do if it is even an option with Apple for me at this point.And contrarily to what some say no, I don\u0027t need to be two inches from the screen to see them, and I am looking at the monitor perpendicularly.Other than that, small problems with the USB, it seems that I need to unplug and plug my external mouse for it to be recognised when the computer wakes up from sleep.","The laptop automatically switches the desktop resolution when you plug the S-Video cable in so I didn\u0027t have to fiddle with monitor settings to get it working.All in all, I\u0027m pretty happy with the performance and happy with the price.","I have a Sony SXRD HDTV panel, and after connecting the panel to the Vaio via the HDMI port and selecting external monitor I am happy to say that the Blu-Ray movie played just fine at 1080 on my HDTV.The Nvidia 7600GT graphics chip is advertised as HDCP HDMI compatible and if you dig enough you find that it also has the encryption chipinstalled.So the review on this site saying that the AR290G does not play Blu-Ray movie titles is either out of date, or just inaccurate.","While the location is a bit weird, it\u0027s great having them for flash cards, scanner, a mouse, etc.The PC can also support great monitor resolution... another perk if you\u0027re using it in an Office setting with a larger monitor.Another downside is the fact it lacks a normal Printer cable connection.","I bought a G4 Powerbook a few months ago now and it is a fine laptop; very useable, very attractive, superbly designed and very expensive!BUT:I had my first Powerbook replaced within a month due to a faulty screen and now the one I have has developed a dark area on the monitor and the hinge is sticking.","I did notice that when configuring the Vaio video out, the external monitor is labeled as \"Sony HDTV\" so maybe there is something unique that requires a Sony HDCP HDMI compatible HDTV, but I doubt it.","Yes, it weighs more, but the display is fabulous (better than my old monitor at home), the keyboard is large enough to allow me to work all day, and the wireless connectivity is great.This computer is good for a desktop replacement.","The only thing I do not like so much is the screen size and shape, It is not square, it is kind of retangular, maybe because I am used to squared screen monitors that I find it weird.","What I got was an enormous headache with hardware and software problems within 2 weeks (e.g. I could NOT load Photoshop Version 7 on the machine or use my 19\u0026quot; Viewsonic monitor with the laptop.","Everyone was looking at my monitor instead of the plane\u0027s.","The monitor is great and the 4.5 lbs makes this my best purchase ever.","Also, check out newegg dot com (sorry amazon), where you get a better price and the choice between TR2A, TR2AP1 (the latter comes with WinXP Pro, otherwise it\u0027s identical).The battery lifetime is good, in part due to power manager software, which turns down monitor brightness, regulates CPU / fan, shuts off optical devices (all options can be tuned as one so desires).The screen is crisp, however, I would not recommend working with it for many hours -- it\u0027s still rather small, and strains one\u0027s eyes a bit.Wireless is very sensitive.","Later on, I started to have system crashes intermittently when connecting the computer to an external DVI monitor while in sleep mode and then bringing it up from sleep.","I still have it nowadays but it needs repair - the LCD hinges broke because I kept using it on the subway and abused the monitor hinges pretty badly (always bending them back and forth, leaving them vulnerable to bumpy roads, train tracks, etc... when I rode transportation of any kind).The other issue is that around the same time the LCD issue was arising, my HD burnt out.","The sound is terrific, plenty of USB ports, and an iLink port (Firewire) are available, as well as a monitor output and a parallel port.At 512 MB of RAM, memory is a little on the small side, especially in light of the fact that the VGA card uses some of it.Now, Sony support is easily the most disappointing ever.I cleared the hard drive in order to upgrade to Windows XP professional (it came with Home edition), and realized too late that there were no drivers included.","I\u0027m not certain if damage is as result of it being refurbished by seller(monitor parts), or if the screen is showing early signs of malfunction.","Had some trouble getting dual monitors with this resolution configured, but all did work when Dell monitor was configured as 2nd monitor not primary.","I am the author of two books (available from Amazon) that I wrote on a PC hooked up to a 15\" monitor.","The big, beautiful monitor is the best feature.","And the power! 2 Ghz of Pentium muscle, 512 MB of RAM, all tucked into a svelte case with a 12\" LCD monitor and built-in wireless.","What I realize when I get my computer back is the fact that they did not re-assemble the computer properly and hence, my monitor does not work.","After a good deal of research, including spending time customizing and pricing a variety of models online, I settled on the Toshiba Satellite A135-S4487.Here are some of the pros of this laptop:+ Runs the new Windows Vista perfectly well, including the Aero interface (and I must add that I have found Vista to be a solid upgrade from XP).+ Nice big widescreen monitor.+ Toshiba support is quite good, both on their website and over the phone.+ The fingerprint reader is very cool, and especially good for multiple users.+ Switches between multiple windows and programs very easily and quickly.+ Start up time and logging on is very fast.+ The computer is very thin and feels even lighter than I was expecting.+ The 4 USB ports provides for a variety of uses and flexibility.+ The sound system is suprisingly strong for a laptop; I\u0027ve watched a couple movies on it so far and the sound was perfect.+ The massive hard disk space is quite nice.+ Runs very quietly most of the time, even quieter than my desktops I\u0027ve had at home or work.+ Was able to easily and seamlessly connect to my wireless router.The only two negatives I can think of are:- The battery is pretty weak, with charges lasting about 2 hours.","Both models are nice and compact, have tons of inputs (card reader, IR w/ remote, 3 USB ports, RGB monitor out, and Firewire).So the laptop has it\u0027s weak points, and it\u0027s strengths.","The notebook DOES have a max resolution of 1400 x 1050 on the Intel Graphics card, but the larger resolutions will require a VGA monitor to use.All and all, for what the notebook is worth, it\u0027s not bad.","There is such a significant difference in clarity that it is better than my stand alone LCD monitor.","LOVE IT\u003eand the SERVICE as well! Elizabeth August 2008 Ordered the E510 with several upgrades like 1GB RAM and GeForce 7300LE video card, and 20.1\" WFP widescreen LCD monitor among others.","There also is an S-video out port, so you can show a DVD or other video on a TV set, and not just on a computer monitor.","OSX is fantastic, and the next purchase will be Macbook Pro or iMac where I\u0027ll run VM Ware with XP Pro and a dual monitor.","This is my third Gateway laptop using the same form factor, and the monitor hinge is rather weak, and I have experienced serious cracking with my first one.","Monitor/Video: 14.1-inch TFT 32MB video memory6.","With the exception of screen damage and minor dust, I would describe the overall condition of the unit as \"good\" as everything else appears to be in good working order.The minor damage to the screen monitor concerns me, but not enough to return at this time.","Plugged in, the monitor is at its brightest, but unplugged it automatically switches to the \"VAIO Ultimate Battery\" setting, which dims the monitor a bit.","So if the hardware doesn\u0027t get you, Microsoft\u0027s incompetence will.Would a Mac be more reliable? The operating system is certainly light years ahead of Vista in terms of reliability, but a very big part of that is due to the fact that there are way less programs to run on it and even less peripherals to connect to it; and Apple\u0027s track record with the hardware is equally abysmal.Linux was my great hope, but it has been quashed by the many things that still don\u0027t work - no sound, no external monitor...","On the right, we have 2 USB 2.0, external monitor output, card reader, and DVD-writer.Bundled Software (mostly trial bloatware junk): Yahoo! Music Jukebox, Google Desktop, eBay (for some reason, theres a shortcut to an eBay executable file), Intervideo WinDVD, Microsoft Money Essentials, Microsoft Office 2007 trial, Microsoft Works, Ulead DVD MovieFactory, McAfee Internet Security trial, Protector Suite (for fingerprint reader).Strengths:- Compact \u0026 Lightweight- Built-in microphone (contrary to a previous reviewer, there IS a mic)- Built-in fingerprint reader- Glossy ScreenWeaknesses:- Is fairly thick for a compact notebook at about 1\"+- Keyboard layout isn\u0027t that great- Weak speakers, no bass.","Loved the monitor display but hated just about everything else.","It really doesn\u0027t matter to me though as I have a small backpack-like case that I carry it in, along with keyboard, mouse, AC adapter, extra batteries for all, dongle for wired Ethernet/monitor output/NTSC video out, headphones and even an AV cable for connecting to a TV.","In fact, it\u0027s almost like looking into a 15\" CRT monitor (slightly smaller).","I tend to use a second monitor whenever possible and the dual screen functionality works very well (as it does on Windows machines as well.)","I have an hp desktop that I purchased last year and ive already had to get a new monitor and the tower turns off on its own.","I have a monitor for this thing and I use a cooling pad with it when it is on my desk, and I have a mini cooling fan that also tilts the computer at an angle more conducive to typing...so, overall, I only worry that it may shorten the life of the computer.2.","The Vaio is tucked under the external monitor shelve - and I got miles and miles of space to junk up...If you\u0027re still thinking - stop... just go for it and follow the popular advice about the extended life battery and the bluetooth peripherals - you\u0027ll be VERY happy with this computer!! I\u0027ve had this Macbook for several weeks now.As soon as they updated the low end model with a Core 2 Duo cpu and 1 GB of Ram I couldn\u0027t resist to replace my 1gz G4 iBook any longer.I can understand why x-windows start raving about the OS but I\u0027m not going to go in to how great Mac OSX is.The Good:Quality, it\u0027s fast, good looking and I LOVE the glossy display.","The monitor is bright, crisp and color is great.","My requirements for a notebook was at least 528MB ram, 60GB hard drive, DVD-R +/-, wireless card, a decent monitor, good brand, and most of all light.","DUAL MONITOR support is wonky, unreliable and ultimately useless.","Fortunately, I don\u0027t generally have to use the drive outside my home.Edited to Add: After about 9 months, the motherboard died (with no warning from the hardware monitoring feature of Windows Vista!!).","The monitor doesn\u0027t turn on, and there are no signs of life to it.","Also use an external monitor with screen spanning.","self corrects, travels like a dream runs a couple of old huge Hitachi monitors, a ten year old HP desk jet 895cse printer, a newer scanner.Strong hinges, screen still very good, three years later, still using it.","It surely is not the lcd monitor you might expect from Vaio.","I also maxed out the RAM at 2 gigs, which has helped tremendously.I added a bluetooth keyboard and mouse (apple) and use my existing 20\" flatscreen, with the laptop\u0027s screen acting as a palette monitor while I am in the office.","The large screen means you really don\u0027t need to worry about hooking up the machine to a larger monitor even when you are working for long hours (though the resolution is an issue).While the detachable keyboard and wireless mouse may seem like a novelty, they are notable for one reason.","There is a monitor port, TV out, a SD card slot -- absolutely all kinds of little goodies.","It seems though, that you need to set it up each time you want to use dual monitors, but I could be wrong.","i must say, i have never found it simpler to integrate wireless browsing (including wireless print server), an external dv monitor (for expanded desktop space), and a home network of 5 wireless peripherals.","This attempt on improving monitor resolution seems to be a standard on all Macs.","The 17 inch screen is the best I have seen to date on a notebook or a monitor and a double bonus of getting the new XP pro media version - - for the people that don\u0027t already know media version - - its just XP PRO with new media built in, so you still get the great XP pro.","IF YOU CAN GET AN EXTERNAL MONITOR/S-VIDEO CONNECTION EVEN WORKING (TAKES A LOT OF MESSING WITH) THE ASPECT RATIO ON THE LAPTOP\u0027S MONITOR WILL NEVER BE THE NATIVE RESOLUTION.Forget gaming, the best game I could get to work was GTA: Vice City.","Of course the 14\u0026quot; TFT screen only supports 1024x768, but I have it configured now to simultaneously drive an external monitor at a total of 2048x768!

With AMD 2000 Mobile processor with Power Saving Mode. -- not bad for games, internet, also for some video editing4.","This notebook also packs a lot of power with it\u0027s Pentium 4 processor, which makes it quite loud, however.Some drawbacks:1.)Loud (emabrassing when you are tyring to access wireless at the libary)2.)Poor battery performance (only 2 hours at most)3.)Poor sound system (Definitely get a set of decent speakers and an external sound card if you can afford it.)4.)Only 512 MB RAM.","The fastest I\u0027ve ever seen the processor run has been in the 300 Mhz range, even when doing memory intensive applications.","When I first got the machine home and turned it on, it went through a short configuration routine in which the AirPort card automatically detected my wireless network and had me on the Internet in minutes -- no loading PC card software and setting parameters and entering system ID\u0027s.I\u0027m seriously thinking of getting a dual-processor 1.42ghz Power Mac as my next desktop.My only reservations center on the relative paucity of native OS X software.","The big screen, accurate colors on the screen, DVD burner, and powerful processor make this a fantastic machine to write code/design websites/edit multimedia files on.","you can use a realtime cpu clock like wincpuid or amd\u0027s dashboard to monitor the processors speed The recent reviews are all dead on.","I have not once taken it in for a tune-up, repair, inspection, ect.The only minor hindrances are as follows:The keyboard doesn\u0027t light up which makes typing in the dark difficult.For some reason my hard-drive is almost full so everytime I search for something in the search bar, it runs really slow.It doesn\u0027t use an IBM processor so I guess you can say it is a true blood mac, which makes some programs incompatible.Now the good stuff:I actually think that if you consider it was made 5 years ago, it is a better computer than what apple makes now.","By touch it seems the processor is runing very hot and automatic power management (ACPI) is slowing it down so much that apps crawl or is shutting the system off completely at random timesI am dreading sending it to Sony given the reviews below.So ultimately for such an expensive machine, relaibility has been poor - its nearly unusable now that the slowness and shutdowns have begun.","Great for traveling with an awesome screen for DVD\u0027s and a fast processor and 2GB memory for work intensive applications.","It makes it a little more difficult to upgrade.While it has a Turion 64 processor, it doesnt come with a 64 bit version of Windows XP.","After this experience, I will don\u0027t think I will go back to Sony again.PROS:* Stylish looks, all aluminum palm rest (but cheap lid design)* Weights 4lb 3.4oz (I measured it with my postal scale)* Intel Duo Core @ 1.83GHz* 1GB of DDR2 RAM* Huge 120GB HDD (5400RPM)* First dual graphics laptop* GeForce Go 7400 (top of the line \"thin-n-light\" graphics processor from NVIDIA)* Nice little built-it webcam (but very low quality videos and pics)* Very bright screen (but had 3 defective pixels in a row)* Runs very cool and very quiet (even when playing 3D games)* Can play Dungeon Siege II at 1024x768 with medium setting at around 40-60fpsCONS:* Cheap looking lid surface (feels like sand paper)* No locking hinge for LCD screen* Annoying external Wi-Fi antenna (even without GPRS option)* Makes loud-whining noise when playing DVDs with labels (i.e. Memorex, Neato)* Battery jiggles and doesn\u0027t feel secured in place* Huge AC adapter weights exactly 1 pounds and is bigger than Dell\u0027s normal adapter* Battery life is a little disappointing (2h:45m on performance mode and 3h:15m on stamina mode) Let me start with a simple disclaimer, first I worked for Apple (a long time ago) for 11 years, I also worked for Microsoft for 6 years and I\u0027m pretty comfortable in both camps but I truly love Apple for it\u0027s design and combined hardware/software implementations.","Performance is more than adequate when I run Macromedia\u0027s Dreamweaver and Fireworks applications, Microsoft Excel, Word, few browser windows, and Outlook email at the same time.Here are few complains; AC adaptor is bulky, tiny printed user guide with all instructions and help files online, no recovery or software disks included, but instead the recovery files is saved on a special partition on the hard drive and you need to create the recovery media yourself using the provided utility, one blank DVD and one blank CD-R, battery life under 2 hours, hard drive speed is only 4200 RPM, the 2100 DDR-Ram speed is only 266 Mhz, and finally the video memory is shared with the default being 64 Meg(user configurable to 32,64, or 128 Meg through the BOIS), but with 1 Gig of Ram, sharing won\u0027t disappoint.A word about Hyper Threading or HT processor, while it is a promising technology for tomorrow\u0027s fast memory and HT aware software, for today\u0027s user there is a little gain.","Both lack the PC Card (PCMCIA) slot but can accommodate AirPort Extreme wireless network.Other than faster G4 processor, just about the only reasons to consider 12\" PowerBook are:- Larger memory capacity on the PowerBook (1.25 GB vs. 640 MB)- Larger hard disk (40 GB vs. 30 GB)- PowerBook can drive an external display (dual display) up to 2048-by-1536 via DVI port; iBook can only mirror up to 1024-by-768 via VGA port- SuperDrive (DVD burner) is optional on PowerBook; it is not available on iBook- Bluetooth is standard on PowerBook; it is optional (built-to-order) on iBook- Marginally faster GeForce FX 5200 graphics card on PowerBook (vs. Radeon 9200 on iBook)- PowerBook is slightly lighter (4.6 lbs vs. 4.9 lbs) and slightly smaller (10.9-by-8.6-by-1.18 inches vs. 11.2-by-9.1-by-1.35 inches)- You like the PowerBook\u0027s anodized aluminum allow chassis betterThere are sufficient reasons to get the iBook instead:- Costs almost 50% less- It is not dramatically slower- Longer battery life (up to 6 hours vs. 5 hours)- Polycarbonate plastic chassis is more scratch proof and offer better wireless network (AirPort Extreme) receptionHow is the iBook in itself? For a little over a grand, you get a beautifully designed notebook (similar to iPod) packed with features: combo CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive, optional 802.11g AirPort Extreme wireless network, beautiful LCD, sensible keyboard layout, snappy performance under included Mac OS X Panther 10.3 -- all in very portable form factor.","In that particular case, the solution worked.)Cons:Power hog...battery lasts only 2 hours because its processor wasn\u0027t designed for a notebookFan is loud (because it gets too hot)Gets extraordinarily hotSlow spinning HD (4200 RPM)...","Here are the pros and cons of this laptop:PROS:*Performance:The laptop comes with a 2.2ghzs celron processor, which is more than enough for the average student.","I purchased my 4030 for 1290 when dells sold at 799 with better features.Problems:Its slow! My Inspirion same processor etc. is faster by a long shot.The mousepad stops responding constantly! It apparently happens to many HP;s Google it.Order it with Broadcom Wireless.","This MacBook Pro is the second fastest Mac notebook ever, only slower to the more expensive model of this same release.When Steve Jobs announced the new Macs, with Intel Core Duo processors I was almost certain I wanted to buy one.","I have always been extremely satisfied with Toshiba\u0027s Satellite line of laptops.The T7200 processor is one of the fastest mobile available now.","Highly recommended!!! I have the dv1040 which is the original model of the dv1000\u0027s with the centrino processor.","Why? Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch.","Great Notebook for a bargain price.Bigger processor means more heat and more fan.","But in many other ways, you can see how you get what you pay for:1) The \"mobile pentium\" must be one of the slowest processors for the given clock speed.","The only real reason I bought it was because it was on sale for like $650 or something.I really liked the processor, built in wireless (it\u0027s not in the way), plug ins, keyboard, bigger screen.The 256MB RAM it starts off with is pretty terrible though; you REALLY need to upgrade it to atleast 1GB (2 500MB chips,) or 2x1GB chips.","Perhaps there is a compability problem between the new intel processors and apple.","With the core solo processor and mediocre graphics card, I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s much I can do except disable some of the start up tasks.* Doesn\u0027t handle transparent Aero well - the computer gets choppy when handling this cosmetic feature of Vista so probably need a Core Duo Processor to run Vista to maximum ability.","What this means is, when I play Battlefield 2 ONLINE with this machine, I need to remove the battery (or whatever modular bay is on the right hand side) and put in a \"COLD COMPRESS\" ice pack (used for bruises and such), wrapped in two ziplock backs (to reduce condensation), because the video processor (a chip, not a card like in a desktop - the cooling method is different) will get hot.","In fact, there\u0027s only one.* The battery is not replaceable.* There is no integrated Wi-Max.* The battery life is on par with current generation Apple laptops.* It\u0027s \"underpowered\" in this generation of overpowered desktop-replacements.Consumers who worry about the above, but still want to run a variation of OS X may purchase this:Apple MacBook MB063LL/B 13.3\" Laptop (2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, 8x Super Drive) BlackOr this:Apple MacBook Pro MA896LL/A 15\" Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive).Or simply get the Thinkpad X300 and run it on a last generation OS.But I gave this 5 stars, why?* It\u0027s beautiful.* The build is solid.* I can carry it in one hand with no effort.And here\u0027s the thing about the lack of ports.* Peripherals will eventually all be wireless.Bluetooth peripherals are already in the marketplace (obviously where Apple hedges its bets on).","Hopefully vistas drivers will be released soon and this problem will go away, but for now this laptop is a very expensive movie player/ word processor.","The transition hasn\u0027t been a smooth one.If you are a designer or photographer (after all, isn\u0027t that who Apple supposedly builds these machines for?) you will immediately notice that Adobe has not yet rewritten their suite for the new Intel processors.","This processor is also mobile so you can connect to a wireless network and not have to plug it into an ethernet port.Connections on this laptop are as follows2 USB ports (one on each side)1 PS/2 port1 VGA port for connecting a monitor1 ethernet port1 moden port1 PC card portIt comes with a DVD Rom/CD-RW combo drive as well.","The Celeron processor is about what I expected considering 256 M ram.","256 mb of memory makes the 2.4 GHz processor seem really slow.","The 1ghz processor is spiffy and it\u0027s perfect if you need a thin light notebook.","It encodes movies blindingly fast compared to my old P4, and even if it\u0027s a lower-end core 2 duo processor, it still does a fine job.","One note is to see the units with dual-core processors...they\u0027ve dropped a few hundred in the past month since I bought this.","About the heat, It\u0027s not a problem, I work a lot of hours with no problems, well only when you put a CD/DVD it makes a lot of noise, but that is because the quality of the disc.I have to problem with my VAIO, when I make a clean format I have problems to find some drivers, but after that It works very well.So, if you like the big screen and the better quality in image and design, Buy a VAIO AR Series...!GrettingsJC - From Per\u0026uacute; I Have nearly the exact same laptop, mine instead has only 3 gigs Ram, and the Intel Core 2 Duo t9300 which is the newer penryn 45 nano meter processors, the processor in the displayed laptop is the 65nm cpu, smaller cpu\u0027s offer longer battery life by using less electricity, in using less electricity it produces less heat.","It features two cores on a single die, which effectively gives you the performance of two processors.","Why?

I can\u0027t download flash player or html5 or antything! I can\u0027t watch videos or do anything that requires flash plugins! The internet goes slow and I can\u0027t get anything else because it has a powerpc processor and here\u0027s one thing you readers should know: Don\u0027t ever get a powerpc processor, you can\u0027t get chrome, flash or anything.","This graphic processor will work well for most gaming, and it is great for viewing back complex H264 movies, including high definition videos.","I did not want a repeat of the graphics card failure, so I ended up putting the laptop on a wire dish-rack ($5 in the housewares section of your local discount store)and it lifted the laptop enough to give adequate ventilation.Also, the power supply is a huge brick, and the battery life is terrible, not surprising for a 17\" laptop with a desktop-type processor, but I mention this because the laptop itself is heavy, and if you plan to travel with it occasionally, the power supply is going to add weight.Also, I had wanted a 17\" laptop because I wanted a separate numeric keypad built into the laptop - the ZD7010us delivered and I really liked the keyboard - great feel and good key placement and size -- much better than the DV9910us I am using to write this review.","Very fast processor.2.","The processor is a 2.4GHz mobile celeron and I installed 1GB of Ram (system max).","The Apple MacBook Pro with 2.33GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 17-inch TFT widescreen display (1680 by 1050 pixels), 2GB DDR2 SDRAM, 160GB 5400-rpm hard drive and SuperDrive is almost everything one could ask for in 15.4 by 10.4 by 1.0 inches package.","I e-mailed Averatec about this discrepancy, but never heard back from them.The computer has an AMD Sempron 2600+ CPU (processor) so I went to the AMD website and, with a little effort, found that the processor did have a specified 1.83 GHz clock speed.","It also sports an Intel Celeron M processor with a not too impressive 1.60 GHz clock speed.","That added to a $...Toshiba mail-in rebate, drew down the final cost to ...!

but read the cons bellow)- fast 100GB HDD and 1GB RAM- carbon fiber casing - light!- durable - I actually dropped it once from about a feet - no trace/problem whatsoever- looks stylish, but not too flashy- love the keyboardOk, so there are notebooks out there that match some of this:- You can get Asus barebone and stick _almost_ all you want in there, which is what I seriously considered, but if you match the features closely Asus becomes more expensive, while delivering LESS (and it\u0027s harder to get).- Dell\u0027s are just too expensive.- Toshiba, Sony, LG don\u0027t use AMD\u0027s processors (silly buggers) and while Pentium M is close in performance area and goes easier on the power/heat it\u0027s not 64 bit, and P4 is way worse in that respect than even non-mobile AMD 64.Now the disappointments:- I worked for a bit on an HP notebook and I have to say, its screen performed better in terms of color reproduction.","A bright, clear screen, large hard drive, speedy processor, wireless LAN, smooth touchpad, and longer-than-average battery life all tucked into a tight and inexpensive 12-inch package.","It wasn\u0027t much, but usually refurbished computers won\u0027t have anyone\u0027s old data at all.Keep in mind that by current standards, the disk drive is small and the processor is slow.","More resolution, more RAM, and a bigger processor is definately needed.","I especially like the 1.7 ghz processor, the 80 gb hd, and the DVD burner.- Pen writes very well.- Screen resistant to scratches.- Good looking.- Well-designed keyboard; responsive and smooth, keys well laid out.- Good screen resolution.- Expandable memory (I added another 512 mb to make a full gb: helps a lot!).- Customizable power settings.","If they tell you to send the computer, do it and they\u0027ll repair it for free.The only downside to this computer that I found is that the processor runs at a very low speed, even when not idle or hibernating.","The dual core processor does it`s work very well and the 1 GB RAM is more than enought to do all jobs I want.","I can\u0027t tell the difference between this and my room-mates who spent hundreds and hundreds more for the bigger screen and the bigger processor.","Why?

The processor is plenty fast enough for me and although I plan to use an external drive for my mp3s and videos, the hard drive leaves plenty of room to work with if I don\u0027t have the external handy or if I need to work from the drive.Performance wise, Vista has a built in ranking system and grades the PC in various areas on a scale from 1-5.","I received my stock MacBook Pro with 2.0GHz Intel Core Duo processor and 100GB hard drive last night, and this thing has completely blown me away.","The PB\u0027s graphics processor has no trouble driving my monitor at that resolution.","But the popularity of THIS notebook is completely undeserved.With my money back I got a fully loaded notebook with double the HD capacity, 4 times the RAM, a newer (presumably faster processor -Intel Core 2 Duo), dedicated graphics card, double layer DVD recorder with lightscribe, bigger and brighter screen, and most importantly: superb, friendly costumer service.","Like the screen and keyboard layout but processor is slow.","With it and the underlying Intel processor, you can be compatible when you need to be, which these days isn\u0027t often.","Gotta like that!

AMD has PowerNow! technology, which automatically controls the processor speed in relation to its usage.","The AMD Turion 64 processor seemed as functional as any Intel product.","As far as raw processor power goes, I found it a bit slow at first (though much faster than a 1.33GHz PC).","You can get gcc on your system if you download Xcode, but you have to sign up for a (free) Apple developer membership.As far as the hardware goes, there\u0027s a lot of FUD going around about the switch to Intel processors.","Others, even some in the $1800 and up price were VERY hot running the dual core processors.","Routing surfing will give you around 4-5 hours depending on the screen, volume, wifi, and processor settings.","Although it has a 1.86 GHz processor and 1 GB RAM, it is very slow compared to a slower model.","The biggest shortcoming is battery life--tops is 2.5 hours; less of course if you\u0027ve got the processor and screen at their highest settings.","But the processor sucks, the battery life stinks, and multitasking is so so.","I just purchased the newest Powerbook G4 with a stunning 17\u0026quot; display, a blazing fast 1.33GhZ processor and I just haven\u0027t been able to put it down.","Just for your information, we have at home Toshiba notebook with Pentium MMX processor (Pentium 1 in other words), which is probably more than 10-15 years old.","The two main problems with this low-priced Mac iBook is that it has an operating system (Mac OS X 10.4.11) that is too old to support any basic download (Flash, Adobe, Foxfire...); and with a processor of G3 and below 900 Mhz, it will not support an OS upgrade (even if you were willing to pay $100 - $450 for the upgrade disc).If I was to say something positive about this item, This makes a very nice \"Word Processor\" .","Which I think is not too bad for a 15.4 inch.My friend has the bigger brother of this (Acer Ferrari 4000)My laptop vs his on 3dmark 2005 I scored 100 points lower than his, (which is not a big deal, I think it\u0027s more of the processor speed than anything else since he has a 2.0ghz turion)After a week have 1.5GB of DDR ram, this is a very very game worthy machine for 1200$ Battlefeild 2 used to stutter is 512mb of ram, it runs fine.","Is it a compromise? Well I guess for those who don\u0027t mind carrying around a 6 lb portable with all the bells and whistles or an ultraportable with slow processor, small keyboard but with more ports, I guess the MBA is.Where there is no compromise is in the speed, full sized keyboard, screen clarity and battery life.","The processor (1.33 GHz) is plenty fast enough for this computer.","The Dual Core processor in this instance is not a low voltage, and drains the battery-Integrated Graphics-Slow processor - 1.6GHz is not thrilling, and the benchmarks, although outbeating the HP and Winbook, are not incredibly impressive-Heavy - 4.2lbs is heavy for a 12\" laptop-Terrible customer service - and Avaratec are infamous for not holding up-Lacking in media controls-Lacking in external outputs-Terrible speakers - Just ugly, weak, and tinnyBOTTOM LINE: I good starter laptop.","I will be writing my second novel on this computer, it\u0027s really all I needed and I think the processor runs better than intel.","I also upgraded the hard drive to 100GB, which the system handles with no issues.Despite the fact that the processor is the older single core vs. the newer dual core intel and AMD models, the performance is still comparable.","I got this laptop back in 2007 for graduation and it seemed like everything I would want: Fast processors, large memory, large screen, full loaded media.","So, here are things that make this laptop stand-out or stink-up.Pros:- The Centrino Chip clocks at 1.5MHz; I have heard that this translates to a P4 2.5MHz processor.","The newer Thinkpads have Core 2 Duo processors (marginal performance increase over the Core Duo in this laptop), and are Vista Ready.","After 4 months of use, here are some things I consider notable:+ Clean exterior lines, glossy-black exterior with sharp-cut edges contrasting with simple, polished silver interior+ No annoying, high pitched capacitor whine+ hibernation/sleep/wake is flawless+ sweat from your palm does not permanently stain the enamel finished palmrest+ fan noise really low after April 2006 BIOS release update+ included Microsoft OneNote 2003 is quite useful with great UI+ LCD: LG Philips LPG6500 15\" XGA TFT+ HDD: Toshiba MK4026GAX 40GB 5400RPM with 16MB cache+ Takes power efficient DDR2 4200 Memory (compared to DDR) (Hynix DDR2-533 1.8V 256MB preinstalled)+ Optical Drive: TSST TS-L462C- Noisy optical drive (unless you set the quiet drive utility manually, which always defaults into \"noisy mode\")- Celeron Processor does not throttle down even when doing nothing- Left palm area warm- BATTERY LIFE (~1hr, 4 cell 29 Watt hour basic pack)- no card reader or IEEE 1394All in all, Toshiba really packs some high quality components into this nicely designed/built \"budget\" notebook.","Intel Core Duo Processor 1.8 GHz3.","What else can I say abou tthis laptop besides its just great! No crashing, voice command that can even tell you knock knock jokes, an impressive processor, beautiful design, illuminating keyboard, great bluetooth capability, and even the touchpad works beautifully.","AC adapter), same processor (the new Intel ultra-low-voltage Pentium M 733 (based on the Centrino, not Pentium IV, running at 1.1Ghz but with an amazing 2MB level-2 cache!), same screen, and same hard drive (slow-ish 4800rpm 40GB shock resistant drive).The differences among the models are as follows:- The 140 and 160 come with a DVD-ROM/CD-RW drive, so you can\u0027t burn DVDs.- The 150 and 170 come with dual-format DVD burner/CD-RW drive, so you can burn both the plus and minus formats of DVDs.- The 140 and 150 come with 512MB of RAM.- The 160 and 170 come with 1GB of RAM (max the T-series can take).- If there\u0027s a \"P\" after the model number (e.g., VGN-T150P/L), it means the computer comes with WinXP Professional installed.","I am quite sorry but I have to admit that AMD really cannot do the same job in processors for notebooks.","I bumped up the memory to 2GB just to give Windows room; it may be possible to run with just 1GB, but I did not mind spending the extra $140 for the memory.Plus points: powerful processor, big big screen, nice enough keyboard, quiet fans, nice speakers, bluetooth integration, price is competitive with other PCs.Negative points: DVD drive died and replaced under warranty in the first week, big screen means more weight, and hot machine (don\u0027t put it on your lap unless you are sitting inside an igloo).Intangible point: a Microsoft consultant said to me: \"Your laptop is really cool; who makes that?\" Ha.","To surf Internet, make powerpoint presentations and word documents, its just great! Also, it\u0027s great because it has a DVD burn drive!I give 4 stars because it has a slow processor.... so, it has a slow performance, Everything else is what my Mom need!!! I bought this computer for my online graduate education but have ended up using my four-year-old desktop instead for most of the work.","I bought mine on sale at Wal Mart for 950, so it seems like a powerful laptop with the centrino processor, DVD superdrive, and Xbrite screen for a cheap! price.","Strongly advise buying one if you need a reliable, inexpensive computer and you don\u0027t need a lot of processor speed I bought one of these a few weeks ago to use for presentations to clients while on the road.","I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day.","I was impressed with the specs - and especially the 8O GB HDD and DVD burner.But the Athlon processor was a turn-off.","I got this notebook for the configuration, the processor, memory and XP OS.","It does not pass the video on to the processor, so it doesn\u0027t work like a video capture source.","When the processor is working at full blast, you can hear the noise, but it\u0027s still much quieter than my IBM Boeing-747-take-off kind of noise.","The things I like best about this laptop are its screen, sleek look, but more importantly great processor speed and good battery life.","I am disappointed that the intel processor will not run os 9, denying access to my favorite old applications and files.","I will never by or suggest anyone buying from them this compaq notebook is real fast and has many other functionality like wireless networking among others like 512 ram, 2.4 Ghz processor, 60GB harddisk and many other.","What do you expect when you have a fast processor and graphics card in such a small unit.","It terms of how the computer feels, this is the lowest quality product by Apple I have owned.This computer is fast running applications built for Intel processor.","I would have to lift my Dell off the bed about every 30 minutes to makes sure the pent M processor \"cooled down\".","(I read so many other reviews suggesting that Vista was too taxing on the processor and 1 GB of memory).","Pros:The NVIDIA 7600 is a great video card.Windows Vista Experience score of: 4.5 (Very Good) low item is hard drive 4.5 and top item is processor 4.7.Great case design.Cons:Too much software junk from HP.Touch pad isn\u0027t as responsive as my old Toshiba.","First off you get the 64 bit processor..an ATI graphics system...dvd/dvr and plenty of memory and hd space.","There are a few minor inconveniences, like no expansion slots, the DVD drive only being capable of CD-RW burning and not being able to upgrade the processor, but hey, you get what you pay for.","Altough it is not designed for that kind of work, the processor works pretty good and has enough RAM for almost any application.I am happy with my purchase, no problems at all: silent, powerful \u0026amp; fast (not the best PC of course), not heavy, well made, clean screen, nice touchpad and keyboard, great connectivity (WiFi, VGA, Ethernet, USB, FireWire, you name it!) and super value.","It\u0027s not natively run on this computer so it runs a bit slow but in due time new software will be compatible with the dual core processor.","Since there are eight different models here to choose from I\u0027ll restrain myself from talking about any specifically and try to help you tell the difference between the specs of each.Processor: Core 2 Duo processors are better than the slightly older AMD Turion technology.","The memory, processors, wide screen and capabilities far exceed what I had on my desktop.","It is a 64-bit processor (which is required for the Ultimate Vista), but low benchmarks makes the price not so suprising.RAM - 512MB, for a Vista laptop, you need a 1GB minimum, no questions.","Which is sold separately :) PROCESSOR/RAM: Out of the box, it ought be good enough for most application development for the next couple years.","I clicked on system icon in the control panel and was surprised to see that the processor speed was only 798MHz, not 1.83 GHz.","Windows XP will run natively on the Intel processor and on a separate hard disk partition with Boot Camp.","Why not AMD? Well, I have nothing against AMD but this one has a 64bit Turion processor.","It took 2 hours on the phone and three supervisors to get the warranty-covered repair authorized.When it was working, the computer ran much more slowly than one would normally expect, even taking into account slower-than-average processor than is usually found in notebooks now.","I have heard from a few sources that this is a common problem with Compaq Laptops.Overall, not very good for processor intensive games (Like Unreal Tournament or Warcraft 3), but great for sound editing, picture tweaking, internet applications, and just fiddling around with.My roomate got a Hewlett Packard laptop with just about the same specs, and for about the same price, if not a little less.","This \"official\" fix cuts battery life by more than 50% and likely will result in the premature death of the processor.","AMD is getting a good piece of market share with these new processors.","The new processors have some other improvements to include some power saving ability, but my limited understanding is that the improvement in speed is very slight.","The only frustrating moment was when I worked on Office 2004 or Creative Suite 2, and it was because of the PPC to Intel processor translating thing, but only before I upgraded it to 2GB RAM, then I never complained again.","The speed for this processor is not decreased as it is not designed to do so like the true mobile-version processors that are available now.With that being said, this laptop really can replace a desktop easily.","Nice fast processor.","Therefore, unless you are going to use linux, the extra registers and stuff characteristic of a 64bit processor are wasted.","When Apple came out with the duo core Intel processor, I still wasn\u0027t convinced that I could happily move to a new system.","Look, if you\u0027re looking for blazing processor speed, look elsewhere.","This Core Duo Chip will outperform 3+ GHZ Pentium 4 processors.","Maybe it has to do with the Duron processor because the machine tends to get very hot sometimes (a lot hotter than my other Pentium-based laptops).Compaq lists only a couple of drivers \u0026 updates on their website (mouse and modem drivers).","I wanted a laptop that was relatively compact, had a one gigahertz AMD processor, at least 256 megabytes of memory, and a DVD/CD-RW combination drive.","Processor is extremely fast, RAM is top of the line and hard drive is plenty big.","If you want to go to a P4-M, you might have to spend 150 bucks off Ebay to buy the processor and spend 45 minutes of your time to install it (I\u0027ve done this before, if you want to know how, email me at frombloodtosnow@softhome.net).","They always made great machines based on AMD processors, and this seems to be no exception.The 64-bit Athlon64 cpu delivers roughly the same power as a 3.2 Ghz P4, and not only that, it can run today\u0027s 32-bit applications as well as tomorrow\u0027s Windows for AMD64 (currently in beta) and today\u0027s 64-bit SUSE Linux 9.1 (which includes a fully ported 64 bit kernel).The video chipset is a \"real\" one, using dedicated video memory instead of \"shared ram\".The screen seems lovely for DVD playback, and the HD space is enough even for splitting in two and installing XP + Linux in a dual-boot configuration.Good-bye P4 notebooks...","Or something HP Pavilion dv9330us 17\" Entertainment Laptop (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T5300, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)Once you buy from Elecsurf, you will never hear from them again.","The screen is 12-in and is actually much more comfortable to work with than I thought it would be.The features this unit has are the ones I wanted and I only settled on three (3) things:1- Processor is AMD instead of Intel.","The keyboard feeling is great, the setup out of box is superb.I would only say the when considering this machine with others with Pentium 4-M, the main tradeoff is between 1.5-2 pounds less versus computing power for processor-intensive uses like MatLab or Engineering software or advance digital work.","You can buy 4GB for under $100 nowadays and have a laptop that will be ready and able to run most of the software you want for a good long time.The only people I wouldn\u0027t recommend to buy this are people who want to play graphics-intensive games, since the graphics processor in the macbooks is pretty weak.","It became more attractive to me as Apple redesigned the look and a necessity when Apple FINALLY put a G4 processor in the iBook.I purchased the iBook G4 12\" 800 MHz in early December 2003.","Of course, since the intel processors have higher clock rates, you can concoct tests that will favor them, but these have little bearing on reality.","Professionals will see the new processors beneficial in any professional photo editing, video, or music work.One downside is that due to cost, the machine still comes with a spinning hard drive standard.","Not being familiar with this non-Intel processor, I was a little hesitant, but the price/size were just too good to pass up.","The 797Mhz speed reported is a result of the AMD Powernow! capabilites of the processor.","1000 words just isn\u0027t enough to express my love for this baby.In point form then :: floppy\u0027s out cd-rw is in.: Every software

than the slightly faster Core 2, and like many machines on the market has the GMA950 video card.","The processor speed is fast enough to do a good fast job in PhotoShop.","The keyboard was another unexpected treat with quiet but firm action.The Intel Pentium 4-M processor can use SpeedStep and other power saving techniques.","But finally I decided to go with only this model of Toshiba due to following reasons:*Processor: Its nothing special but yes its has 1.6Ghz Core Duo from Intel.*Its very ligth in weight, very thin, wide screen.*Fast in response as it has 1GB of RAM and 120Gb of HDD*Secured data and laptop: Its has Finger print scanner which secure your data perfectly, nobody can hack your data until you specify dual mode (with password option), also you can quickly log into your machine by just swiping you configured finger.*High Spped wireless: it can handle all protocols for wireless till now, 802.11a which can give you upto 108 mpbs of speed.","I read the reviews about how noisy it is and how hot the processor gets.","If you routinely create and work with large layered files in Photoshop as I do, plan to stay late at work more often.Another major issue has been the heat of the processors.","I wanted something smaller and lighter than my desktop replacement with a 15inch screen at 8.5LBS.While the centrino processor doesnot make me want to do cartwheels, I can say that it is more than adequate for downloading pdfs and backing up movies/music.","The fan is frustratingly noisy and it goes off every thirty seconds because of the heat the processor generates.","ProsDesktop quality processor and hard drive.","Here are the big comparison points I considered.(Note, I am not an expert on computers or components - but all of the following information is correct to the best of my knowledge.)The XPS 1330 uses the newer of the Core 2 Duo processor lines with 800 MHZ front side bus, while the SZ processors have 633 MHZ front side bus.","The summary of what you\u0027d be getting is a single core processor, half of the notebook standard memory, a decent hard drive, and a tack on DVD drive.There are no advanced features of this laptop, this is a laptop designed for mobile travel, and really doesn\u0027t even do that extremely well.PROS:Price - At $600 you can\u0027t be to picky at the laptop you want.Screen - Decent, but still, not up to par with more expensive laptops.CONS:Underpowered - At least put a Dual Core in there, Celeron M is from like 2000, and it was the basic processor for those that couldn\u0027t afford the Pentium.","I, like to many other people, bought this Sony laptop...The DVD-RW never really worked that great but after 1-year it died completely...My girlfriend also bought a Sony Vaio a few months after I did and the DVD-RW died on hers too...Its amazing how things like this happen right after the warranty expires...Almost seems like the Sony engineers design them that way...My laptop overheats like some of the other reviews have stated...I find that if I continually blow the processor fan off with compressed air to keep the dust down it helps a little...Sony Technical support is a Joke...My suggestion...Don\u0027t buy Sony...Go with Toshiba...You will be much happier...As for me...I will never purchase another Sony product again...","Super sleek, really light , great 80GB HDD , built in

problems.Pros:a)When it works, is a pretty decent, basic computer.Next time I will go with pentium or centrino, with a bigger hard drive and DVD-R. Considering all the planned obsolescence and the fact how fast are the new models brought to the market and then replaced with the \"newer better\" versions, I was surprised to see this laptop still being sold.I have owned it almost 3.5 years by now and have sort of mixed feelings about it.It definitely is powerful unit with plenty of storage and high enough processor speed, and I have used it instead of desktop all this time, and have, of course, grown attached to it and rely on it heavily.","It\u0027s a Mac, in spite of the Intel processor, with all the usual simplicities and convenience.","Why? Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch.","It is screaming fast with the Core 2 Duo processor.","After my Gateway toasted itself, I needed to pick up a good, cheap computer to replace it, and the Aspire fit the bill: for what I paid for it at Walmart ($740), I was able to get a lot of features that you would only see on higher end machines- which I\u0027ll sum up with the obligatory pros and cons:Pros:-Dual AMD Turion64 processors-100 GB HDD-Gig of RAM-Looks nice-Integrated camera niftyness-Touchpad based navigation clicker is useful (little silver square between the mouse buttons)-It\u0027s really light- about a pound or two lighter than other notebooksCons:-New product line- might not have the support structure of Dell or HP-The 100 GB HDD is actually two 50 GB HDDs- while that\u0027s a neat feature- the computer cannot recognize them as the same drive: not sure if I like that or not yet*Update: After about 3 days I ran into an issue with the graphics card (software issue, not hardware), and had to get help from customer support: it turns out as I predicted that they have a pretty poor support structure.","HP should have used a better processor and chipset.","Fast processor(s), lots of memory.","I\u0027ve had more parts fail in my desktop computers than I have with this laptop (which is actually a desktop replacement system given it\u0027s got a 2.4Ghz Pentium 4 processor, 2GB of RAM, 160GB HDD, 802.11g/b wireless, CD/DVD burner, four USB 2.0 ports and a FireWire (1394) micro port, and an ATI Raideon Mobility 9600 with 64MB Video RAM).","It really is an amazing breakthrough, from Intel.Video CardThe new MacBook Pro 2 GHZ model features an ATI Radeon X1600 graphics processor using PCI Express 128 MB of GDDR3 video memory.","The processor is a super fast 2.0 ghz quad core i7 great for gaming on bootcamp or on lion (2x-3x faster than previous generations).2.","Newer Intel \"M\" processors get significantly better battery life.","(the upgrade to Vista was a bit of a nightmare, but it works great with the default memory and dual core processor configuration).","The powerful processor, graphics, memory and the arsenal of connectivity options make this a perfect contender for that spot where you monitor now sits.","By that I mean it has the Core 2 Duo processor and comes with Windows Vista.","Good battery, fast processor, plenty of memory both hard drive \u0026 RAM.","I can\u0027t explain it any better than that; you must use the Mac operating system to understand.Many users may be concerned about speed, by which I mean that the iBook has an 800 MHz processor while a similarly priced Windows notebook might have processor between 1.6-2.4 GHz processor.","It has pretty fast processor and 512 Mb Ram, DVD RW+- and 60GB HDD - this is a good thin, but the Graphic Card is not good - if you want to use this item for games - this is not your choice, but for wark and watching movies- perfect laptop.","I would recommend this computer - the only thing I would change for other users might be a faster processor because it slows down a bit when multi-tasking.","Add to that the Pentium 3.2 HT processor with 533 front side bus, large 80 Meg hard drive, very fast wireless B/G adaptor even though my router is an old Linksys 11 Meg B standard, and the dual layer 8X +/- DVD writer, the rest of the specs are large 15.4 brilliant screen, full size keyboard, 56K Modem, 1 Fire wire 1394, 3 USB 2, Ethernet adaptor, 1 A/V out, Microphone in, Audio out, and a lot of multimedia and authoring software.Set up is a breeze, the laptop is unpacked, hooked, and run in 5 minutes, you better have things to do right away.","it would be better to spend a little more and get a better configured laptop with more memory.startup takes forever, closing a window takes a minute (computer hangs during that time) and there is absolutely no feeling of the dual core processor.","If you need help with that, go to Apple\u0027s website, click the \"OS X\" tab at the top, then \"Switch\" under that tab and it will tell you how to transfer files, etc.I got the mid-level MacBook with the 2.0 Ghz Core 2 Duo processor (it\u0027s very fast!), 1 GB RAM, and 80 GB storage.","The unit was lightweight and stylish, the processor speedy - all in all, a favorable first impression.Unfortunately, this relationship quickly turned sour.","I wanted to get the ThinkPad, but it was an estimated 2wk wait, plus it uses a non-duo core processor.","Amazon must ported other laptop data right into this one.This one only weighs 4.9 pound, man!! Amazon won\u0027t let me lower the rating, I wouldn\u0027t give it more than 2 stars...For all that the tx1220us should be with the fast dual-core AMD processor and 2 GB of RAM - the system overall seems to be very slow.","With the purchase of this ibook, however, all of my feelings about Apple\u0027s computers were reiterated and magnified.I feel that this review would be more meaningful if a comparison was drawn between the ibook and a similar high-end laptop offered by Dell (the Inspiron 600M Celeron) Please note that this is not a true comparison because the Dell Inspiron 600M has a 1.3ghz processor while the ibook (14\") has a 1.42ghz processor.The Dell Inspiron 600M at a price of $1,623:1.","Their solution? Alter the power management feature and jack the minimum processor power state to 100% While this seems to solve the black screen issue, it\u0027s effectively turned my laptop into a very hot-running desktop.","4GB RAM max, 64 bit processor which may allow the laptop to upgraded to a 64bit OS in future, Vista or Linux (drivers, BIOS permitting) 200GB drive size.Not an inordinate amount of shovelware.Battery life at just over 2 hours, now that I \"trained\" it.","It is the same G4 processor, but I have a 60 GB hard drive, airport extreme card, bluetooth module, and I upgraded the iBook to 768 MB of memory.This iBook is a great way to step into the world of Mac.","First I\u0027d like to say my unit is the 14.1\" Wxga model, but it has the Celeron M 1.6Ghz processor, 512mb ram, and a 5400rpm 80gb HDD.","Fast dual core processor with centrino - having lots of applications going on at the same time doesnt heat up the laptop when compared to the earlier one I have.3.","Particularly with my iPod and iPhone showing me how superior Apple products could be compared to the competition.So I bit the bullet and purchased my first Macintosh laptop, the new MacBook with glossy screen, dual core Intel processor, and a gig of RAM.","Great processor speed, plenty of memory, no glitches with digital photos, music, etc.","Back then, it represented state-of-the-art with 1\u0026quot;

4th added 1 GHz G4, faster graphics, and SuperDrive), we get more substantial upgrade.","Windows 7 removes this limitation.My computer is 3 years old, but now runs very snappy - far better than it ever performed as a new machine.The fact that it is a duo processor helps as well.I also added a Toshiba usb bluetooth adapter for about $35 that gave the machine bluetooth capability.The biggest downer to this laptop is the graphics chip which is embedded into the motherboard.","The HP had a better processor (Amd 64 x2 tl50), it was in stock, and I really needed a new laptop so I pulled the trigger and bought it.","The AMD 64 bit 1.6Ghz TL-50 dual-cpu processor isn\u0027t really utilized all that well with the unoptimized Windows Vista or Windows XP Pro 32 bit operating systems - but Windows XP Pro (32 bit) works well enough and does recongnize the second CPU/processor and utilizes it for some things.Battery life is good (2 hrs +) but could be better, as could the keyboard - which while good, feels somewhat flimsy.","While not as overall bright as my previous, M35-S456 15.4\" laptop, this is bright enough with a very warm feeling to it.The Intel duo-core processers (yup, there are 2 processors doing duty) is lightening fast.","This basically does what I want--with the optional keyboard and case, requires little space and weight in a suitcase when those are at a premium--major drawbacks are processor speed, battery life (maybe half an hour based on settings), and limited wireless distance.","The 2.0GHz processor is lightning fast and it has better graphics than I have seen on many PCs.","This is not true for processors under 2.0GHz (Intel is the champion above 2.26GHz with 533MHz FSB).","This is a feature of the processor, I knew, so it was overheating.","The bottom surfaces of this machine also become unbearably hot after prolonged use under a processor load.","It is only unfortunate that we could not have seen a small boost to the processors, however, it was evidently not something feasible in this update, so Apple made up for it, with updates to other areas!Screen Resolution - The biggest improvement to the 17-inch Powerbook is an increase in screen resolution.","I can\u0027t say the price here.originally aim for presario 1520us. it has faster processor, more RAM, bigger hard disk, and firewire port.","The keyboard layout is very comfortable.I can say in this price you won\u0027t find any model with Centrino processor and with the quality of Toshiba..","Therefore, if you have any concern, you might want to see if you can special order from Apple online, or in many situations, you will find the standard hard drive to be acceptable.After the processor advancement, Thunderbolt is the other great new technology included in this revision to the MacBook Pro.","The large screen makes surfing sweet and this laptop has FIVE harmon/kardon speakers so MP3s sound GREAT.So based on what I use my laptop for, my buying criteria was:-HD DVD player (preferably a SuperMulti)to watch HD DVDs and burn mps and photo and video DVDs-Minimum 2 GB of Ram which helps speed up processing times-HD drive of at least 120 GB for large amounts of photo and mp3 files-Duo processor with at least 1.8 GHZ to speed up batch processing of photo files-SD card reader for easy transfer of my photos files from my camera.I looked first, of course, at Dell, then looked here at Amazon.","It\u0027s very lightweight and easy to carry, but still powerful enough to be a desktop replacement.Pros: Lots of computer for the money: Core Duo processor, 120GB SATA, 1GB RAM, beautiful widescreen display, Vista Home PremiumCons: Keyboard layout is odd to make room for the never-used multimedia control keys, difficult to downgrade from Vista to XP (took many hours to find correct drivers), headphone jack in front makes it hard to use in cramped spaces such as an airplane.","You can probably get another laptop with a faster processor for the price, but if you are like me, and a new laptop is a major purchase, buying a Sony and not having to worry about quality and reliability is worth it.","Firstly, I would like to explain that my T60p has slightly different specifications from the one listed above; I have a Core 2 Duo T7200 processor, 3GB or RAM, a 320GB HDD, and the ATI FireGL V5250 graphics card.","The processor drops down to about 850MHz (this is a unique feature of Mobile processors) and the LCD drops down to level 1 (at this level, the LCD is very dark).","Other than web browsing and some small Photoshop projects the card is utterly useless.Enough of the bad, on the flipside, the processor is fast despite HT, the keyboard is big and comfortable, the electronic touch pad is nice and responsive.","FYI, when you use this laptop, you\u0027ll hear a high-pitched buzzin/screeching/whining sound coming above the ZXCASD keys (\u0027coz that\u0027s where the hard disk or processor is found).","About the only really multimedia feature missing is a TV tuner.Powering the M115-S3094 is the Intel Core Duo T2050 processor.","I\u0027ll probably add an external Firewire 800 drive for the video work I want to do.- processor speed gets a minor upgrade to 2.4 gHz (from 2.33, or to 2.2 from 2.16 for the lower-end 15\" model - but this is the new Santa Rosa processor - with a faster bus speed of 800 mHz (although the memory speed remains at a max of 667 mHz).For $500 less, the lower-end 15\" model has 128 MB of video ram (instead of 256), a 2.2 gHz Santa Rosa processor (.2 slower) and a 120 GB hard drive.","If it wouldn\u0027t void my warranty I would Put Linux on this machine and at the very least XP Pro, if I could get away with putting either one on I would be giving it 5 stars.The Hardware though, is the most important.The processor is excellent, the 512Mb Ram makes the computer run pretty smooth and is upgradeable to 2GB (You should seriously consider getting at least a gig of Ram to really see what this machine can do!) The 60 Gig HD is fast and perfect for serious mobile users.","However, this processor is a much better processor than anything with netburst architecture.","If your short on money look around for the 1.83 ghz processor it\u0027s quite a bit cheaper than the 2.0 ghz but has the same exact pheriphials.","It solved the issue, but it\u0027s simply not productive to use it to store handwritting as text.It also feels heavier than it looks like.Be carefull I own a very similar model that was sold at ALDI foods and the only difference I can see between the two models is the processor.","The many features such as a CD-RW drive and a nice large screen make it a worthy upgrade from an old pokey desktop.However, the processor and perihperals use entirely too much battery power to be practical portable (to be expected in a fast Pentium IV).","It was great then but was I recently replaced it with a HP G7-1075 HP.***HP G7-1075DX Pavilion Laptop / AMD Phenom II Processor / 17.3\" LED HD Display / 4GB DDR3 Memory / 500GB Hard Drive / Multiformat DVDRW/CD-RW drive / Windows 7 Home Premium Edition operating system - Pewter I\u0027ve had this notebook computer for just under 2 years and in that time it has been nothing but problems.","Looked all over for sub-$900 unit with 1Gig and 100Meg+, and 64-bit processor.","the processor will run a little bit slower and give you a little bit less quality on x brite screen.","The only downside is that the processor is not strong enough for heavy gaming.","BUT, I did what the manual said and calibrated my battery, now battery life lasts about 3 and a half hours, now thats much much better if you ask me!Oh! I almost forgot! The most important thing, I can\u0027t even tell that there are INTEL PROCESSORS in the MacBook.","If the little fan bothers you you can set it from the power panel to where the fan is off all the time - but bare in mind that if it gets hot then the processor speed drops automatically.14.","Processor: PowerPC G4 1.42 GHz2.","For example, the power cord comes out of the right side.- The 64 bit processor runs Windows and other programs at the same speed or slower than an equivalent Pentium Mobile at 1.86ghz.","The T2250 processor in this computer is Core Duo.","I have been using the C140G for a few weeks now.The biggest pain out of the box was all the additionaltrialware and other Sony proprietary programs.The laptop is running much better after a clean up and install of commonopen source stuff- (firefox, thunderbird, vlc, audacity, etc)A good bonus was that I had an old extra capacity batteryfrom an old Vaio that was compatible with the C140G.The laptop does not come with Gigabit Ethernet (1000mps)-which was surprising considering it is positioned as amultimedia laptop.Gigabit Ethernet *is* available on the docking station- butthat will set you back another $200.00For the CPU- it is a great 64 bit core 2 CPU (I have a full 64 bitlinux distro running on another partition) - BUT I wish I wouldhave checked the processor version more closely.The 5500 Core 2 CPU does not support virtualization (VT)- so I can\u0027t runsome of my 64 bit VMWARE virtual machines while booted in XP.The 5600 Core 2 and the 7XXX series do support the VT feature soI miss this feature.Overall - the laptop has a nice form factor and good value for the money.","I bought this notebook a week ago, it is a good notebook, great performance, great processor huge hard disk and the intel turbo memory is really good.","heavy little thing but thats why its a tough book (a) Best keyboard ever made for laptops, (b) Decent speed, runs Office 2007 O.k., (c) Acceptable graphics (ATI

As a 19 year Mac user who goes all the way back to the Mac-II and even before System 7 OS, this newer model Intel 2 GHz Core 2 Duo processor-based MacBook is light-weight, slick-looking, wonderful portable computing.","Apple\u0027s iBook was the last holdout to G4 processor.","So, as long as you\u0027re not looking for the performance of a dual-core processor, you\u0027ll be able to run your basic office applications and stay productive with extended use times.","The brightness does vary as I tilt the screen, but it\u0027s very easy to see from any reasonable angle, it just varies a bit.The Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T7200 gives a crisp feel of speed, and the 5400 rpm 160GB hard drive seems to load files quickly.","You can play DVDs even when the processor is off, by pressing a separate button that just activates the DVD player.","With and Intel Core 2 Duo processor this laptop flies.","it will actually make it a fantastic notebook.additionally, u can actually upgrade the processor to a turion 2.2ghz, and that also makes the unit run a lot cooler (go figure), the memory up to a gig and the hdd to watever is available on the market... and for the real sucky wifi that is included.","I\u0027m not sure if the problem lies with the processor or is related to RAM (comes with 1 GB), but Vista does not function well with these specs.","After calling Sony I found out that this is a stepped processor and does not utilise the full 733mhz unless needed because of the amount of heat it would generate, also 16 of the 128 MBs of RAM is reserved for the video card.","I purchased this ibook so that I would be able to have a portable word processor and it does that.","I think the 1.13Ghz processor and 384 (I recieved an upgrade) RAM make a great combo.","The second generation of this version has a faster processor, a larger hard drive, and still looks great.","My current laptop is a Dell Inspiron 8600 with the then revolutionary Pentium M processor.","If you are looking for a mobile wireless peripherial, this is perfect because it has a mobile pentium four processor and integrated 802.11b wireless so you don\u0027t need to buy a card.","They are also not difficult to replace, but require a little more time with a screwdriver in order to replace.The core duo processor is very fast for its clock speed, so do not let the low frequency (1.83 GHz) fool you.","I\u0027ve had several laptops, including brands like Toshiba, Compaq and HP... and this one has the same or more arguments to compete against all of them, but at half the price....I\u0027ve always been an Intel guy, this is the very first time I ever had a computer with AMD processor.","Needing to address an envelope I opened the word processor, set up the printer, cliked on print and received a window that says this edition doesn\u0027t support printing, but if you click on \u0026quot;Buy\u0026quot; the real edition (for $200+) will print just fine.","I am a teacher in a high school and we just got ten of the small white plastic IBooks with the G4 processor and three of them had the display screens go to black right out of the box.",";-)The processor seems quite fast; Vista takes some getting used to but is pretty user-friendly from what I\u0027ve experienced; built-in wireless capability seems to be working great.","The machine has a fast processor, lots of connectors, surprisingly good battery life, and an excellent wi-fi antenna.","Processor/chipset technologies have also evolved somewhat.","I searching the net I too found the minimum processor fix and have\u0027nt had a problem since.","Witness the 2.8Ghz P4 processor (not the mobile version), which is screaming fast especially for gaming and video/audio editing, as well as 512MB of fast RAM and large screen.","This laptop had everything I needed right out of the box: email, web browser, word processor (text editor), along with the iLife package.","The 505dv is packed with memory (comes with 512, can be upgraded to 2 gigs) and a very fast processor for a computer this small (1.4 mhz pentium M).","The laptop I got was in good condition and had extra memory, hardrive and processor power but it\u0027s not what is advertised.","Only difference is the size and the processor speed which is negligible .","These days I have trouble getting access to it when my daughter visits!!

I recommend this brand over Dell\u0027s and HPs for the price and form factor Bought the computer on my trip to Honolulu Hawaii on Oct. 21.","Every once in a while it slows down but that is because it has a slower processor compared to the computers of today, and I have begun using a lot of graphics software.","I found out it is a common problem with the DV6000 series containing AMD chips.I sent it back to HP and they returned it in about 5 days and I thought everything was good....not so fast.They upgraded the bios to a version that makes the fan run at a slow speed non-stop (VERY ANNOYING) because the processor runs hot and kills the wireless adapter and system board.","(Surprisingly, it wasn\u0027t Vista\u0027s fault at all; swapping Sony and Intel for different brands but the same OS, processor, and RAM eliminated the problem.","The specs were so impressive; 32b Vista 250G hard drive, 2 gig Ram, DVD burner w light scribe, Intel dual core processor high def graphics, fingerprint security, remote, TV tuner, the works.","Once the computer is loaded even though it has a Celeron Processor it is very fast.- The Integrated Wi Fi card is very good, I tried it at the office today and only entered the key for accessing the network and it was off and running.","Sure, they both come with the faster 2.66 and 2.8 GHz processors respectively and are coupled with 512 megs of Ram.","PROCESSOR - The intel Core 2 Duo running at 2.16 GHz is just as fast as I could hope for in a nice little 13\" body of a computer.","And WORST of ALL, the fans are not strong enough for the big processor that Toshiba put in the computer.","All of the NV series notebooks that use the Intel processors are QUIET.","Screen resolution is excellent and the processor speed can take quite heavy loads (such as MS Excel, MS Word, MS Powerpoint, all opened and printing, while Itunes plays internet radio and also checking email), something that i could never do with a PC before.","I\u0027ve never heard of a Pentium M processor before, but I hear it is equivalent to a P4.","With the launch of Vista, Microsoft has developed a new rating system for all computers which rate your system\u0027s processor, memory (RAM), graphics, gaming graphics, and primary hard disk.","Not the Toshiba and I have it configured the same.Performance:I use the laptop merely for surfing and simple word processor/spreadsheet applications.","Haven\u0027t tried 2 screens yet, but moves very well sharing 128MB (max can be shared) with 1 screen.Only enjoyed it for a couple of days (Aug-14-2007) but it has been a fun-filled couple of days.The screen is not as BRIGHT as others, but it has something to do with the fact that it is a \u0027touchscreen\u0027 because it\u0027s a Tablet PC.If you are concerned about the AMD processor speed or the screen size (12in) like I was... you can take the leap - so far I\u0027m very glad I did.","Unfortunately, HP does not stand by this product, as they state it is not a \"known issue\" (for this series, despite having the same processor/nvidia graphic chip combo) and they offered to repair it for an additional $400, after already suggesting I have it evaluated by an authorized repair center for $70.","It is slower than even a 1 GHz processor, of which is standard even for a single core of a modern-day netbook or for an ARM Cortex mobile! With that said, do not expect to dump tasks like video streaming, or games that go beyond simple re-drawing--the 8 MB ATI chip also complements this statement.","New Low Voltage Mobile AMD Athlon XP-M Processor Low Voltage \u003d Longer Battery Life (up to 3+ hours).\"","I like the speed of the laptop which contains a centrino processor.","I\u0027m told that the Intel Duos are the fastest processors, but for gaming I prefer AMD, and any processor will run my college programs.","The cheaper laptops typically use Intel Celeron processors which do not include \u0026quot;Speedstep\u0026quot; technology.","I talked to an Indian who I could barely understand and all she told me was that the only thing she could think it would be was a Defective Processor...Great!

It\u0027s because the computer runs so hot! The processors generate an incredible amount of heat (which is fine), but the system is so poorly designed and unventilated that the bottom of the computer is not warm, not hot, but scalding.","At 1.83GHz and running at fast bus speeds, the processor is a maniac.Screen - Sony always does good here.","On November 28th, 2007 I purchased an HP Pavilion Notebook DV9260US 17\" Entertainment Notebook PC (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T7200, 2 GB RAM, 240 GB Hard Drive, HD Super Multi DVD Drive, Vista Ultimate).For a week or so I wasn\u0027t sure if I would have my purchase completed because of the inept people that work or answer emails at Amazon Com.I had earned 21 gift certificates for purchases thru my Visa Chase Cardamounting to $525.00 Since I live in New Hampshire, gift certificates never expire because of the New Hampshire State Laws.","I have always used the latest Intel processors in my machine and I just was not sure about the AMD Athlon processor.","Good HP Pavilion dv6365us 15.4\" Entertainment Notebook PC (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T5600, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium) GOOD:I was very happy with light weight and keyboard feel.BAD:It was unbelievably slow to boot up on Vista.It died in the 11th month, after relatively light use.ANY LAPTOP USED FOR BUSINESS:Always back up current files on a thumb drive and back up to a portable hard drive regularly.","Most of us really only have these two options.... we can look at RAM, memory, processor speed and a variety of other indicators - but to be honest what characteristics really matters? Hopefully, this review can help make this as painless as possible for the non-tech savvy (The power users already have their preferences).","I use a transcend 512meg CF I card with it and find that it works the best for transferring my text in and out of the word processor to my desktop.","Here are my results (note I did modify the power profiles and brought the processor down a little more - and yes, this can be done because this is a feature of the Mobile processors):Without Docking Station: 3.5 - 4 HoursWith Docking Station: 3 - 3.5 HoursWatching DVD: 2.5 - 3 Hours (Level 9 LCD Setting)Burning CDs: 2 - 2.5 HoursThe graphics on the notebook are not bad.","And most importantly, the Core Duo processor is really fast.","I have been impressed and throughly satisfied for the following reasons:1) It has a fast processor, P4 2.8 GHz which completely satisfies serious computational needs.2) Attractive display.","The dual processors are amazing.","Plus, the screen can be made so much brighter than my iBook, that makes a huge difference in visibility in a high-light environment.I love everything else about my MBP - the better screen resolution, the backlit keyboard, the speakers, the speed of the processor (even though it\u0027s only a 2.2 GHz), and everything else.","You might even say it\u0027s cute...Second, the processor and memory seem to actually be adequate to run Vista.","To get rid of it (at least in order not to hear it unless you are sticking your ears above the hard disk or processor),a) reboot your computer.b) press F10 to enter the boot setup menu.c) go to systems configurations.d) Disable the CPU C4 function.e) Save and exit.That should do the trick.","The big improvements over the past versions are, the speedier processor, Leopard, better graphics card and faster frontside bus.","You\u0027d be surprised by how much faster even web browsing is, when you have a processor as powerful as the Core Duo.","If 2100US fits your requirements then it\u0027s a good buy for its competitive price! Compaq Presario F761US 15.4-inch Laptop (AMD Athlon 64 X 2 Dual Core TK-57 Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Vista Premium)I bought my Presario after an incident with a roommate which involved a glass of water spilling across my old laptops keyboard.","It is only unfortunate that we could not have seen a small boost to the processors, however, it was evidently not something feasible in this update, so Apple made up for it, with updates to other areas!Screen Resolution - The biggest improvement to the 15-inch Powerbook is an increase in screen resolution.","First, the processor in this MacBook is definitely no slouch (and an expensive upgrade for most PC laptops).","The gloss coating probably makes the details more crisp though.* The fingerprint reader works well and I\u0027ve become very accustomed to using it.* The processor is quite fast, so the operating system starts up in a reasonable amount of time.","I can\u0027t believe it..!!! After a while my notebook begins to work slowly, since I\u0027m a technical guy I understood that there is smthng wrong with the main processor..","I\u0027ve just ordered a cooling pad and hope this fixes the problem.The processors and graphics card aren\u0027t top notch but they will suffice for most tasks.","The two major weaknesses of this product are the tiny amount of RAM (if you try running more than one application at once the thing is unuseable) and the short battery life.I also agree with previous reviewers that if you add another stick of RAM to this, it rips along quite well.I purchased this as an entry level machine and use it for web-access, MS Office, watching DVDs on the go, uploading and sorting through digital photos while away from home.The Celeron processor really struggles if I try any heavy photo editing but I generally try save that stuff for my desktop machine.","I had no problems at all with the computer.Goods: The computer ran fast with 2.0 Ghz Pentium 4 Processor and 256 mb of Ram.","For the applications I use (spreadsheets, word processors, net, games...) you cannot tell there is a speed difference between the P4 desktop.","Tempted by the better specs (Intel Core processor, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB HD, better sound, Windows Vista, etc.), I thought I\u0027d get a faster PC for about the same price I paid two years before.","(My VAIO has the 2 GHZ T7200, while the Dell 2 GHZ processor is the T7300).","Also 512MBDDR RAM is a big pluse for multi tasking when you want to surf the web and run othe applications at once.2.4GHZ is as fast as the come at this time in laptops and the processor really moves for all aplications I have used it for.Take my advice spend the little more money for more than you need for latter when you want faster in the laptop world it is hard to upgrade you almost have to buy new.","This is the notebook for you if you want to be able to run all the native Mac apps and run them fast, all conveniently ready to go where ever you are.Battery life is ok. for having a Dual Core processor, it lasted longer than I though at about 2 1/2 hrs. on non-battery save mode (less if running more intensive programs).","On Vray (a renderer) you can see it calculates as if there are 2 processors with 2 rendering buckets.What I\u0027m sure of ..that I\u0027ll always get amazed each time I discover something new about this beautiful Machine.For people talking about short battery life I don\u0027t even use the battery, I remind them this is not a laptop this is a REAL desktop replacement.We went for a vacation, A friend of mine brought his Digital camera but he forgot to bring its USB port! No problem the P25 has a build in SD card reader!Can\u0027t even describe how I played Spiderman II on the wide screen needless to see the original movie :)There are more stories to tell about this Amazing Machine make me give it 10 stars not only 5!!I 100% recommend it for users who never accept less than the best.","Duo core processor - The power doesn\u0027t show up unless you\u0027re doing intensive graphics work or programming5.","Sony even with hibrid memory video and best processor ( 2,00 X 1,66-TOSHIBA ) , run a little bit slower .","This is the tool for a person who needs power, but the actual physical requirement needs to come second to their ideas and creativity.The only con is the battery life, rendering and using this processor takes a toll on it, but when I do most of those type of things, it\u0027s near a wall socket, so it isn\u0027t a big deal.","when i called toshiba, they say my laptop motherboard, screen and processor died.Its amazing that within 2 month all majour part of the laptop is dead!!!!above all toshiba is not able to fix this problem in 3 month!!! how people can trust toshiba in future??? i put negative infinity point for this laptop as well as toshiba.i\u0027ll never buy any toshiba product in future....","I\u0027ve got the extended warranty, so I\u0027m sure that it will be fixed.If you\u0027re doing processor-intensive tasks, and need a machine that can be carried from workplace to workplace, and you don\u0027t necessarily need to be working from your battery all the time, I\u0027d highly recommend this machine.","The processor (CPU) seemed to run a little slower than the published 1.83 GHz.","I considered getting the model right above this (P105-S6114) which had 2GB RAM, 160 GB hard drive and a finger print scanner, but decided that this would be all I really needed since the processors on the two are identical.","I selected this particular laptop because it had a duel-core fast processor, lots of RAM, WiFi, built in CD/DVD player-burner, a decent size hard disk, screen and keyboard - all in a package that weighed only a bit over 4 lbs.","I ran same program in my other Compaq laptop that has 1.4Ghz Intel Pentium IV Mobile processor (with 512K L2 cache memory) + 768mb RAM.","Hence, you will not get any performance enhancement with this processor unless you upgrade everything to pure 64 bit.","It really is an amazing breakthrough, from Intel.Video CardThe new MacBook Pro 2 GHZ model features an ATI Radeon X1600 graphics processor using PCI Express 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory.","It is heavier than many Wintel laptop with low volt processors like Pentium M.11.","If you\u0027ve anxiously awaited the arrival of your Powerbook, you will not be disappointed, when you start to open it up!

I much prefer the Athlon processor to the pentium.","The processor gives me a 4.9 and the hard drive a 5.1.","The worst thing is AMD TURION PROCESSOR - absolute disaster to choose for your laptop! I have always preffered AMD over INTEL but now I see that the quality gap is still very very considerable.","It boast a dual core intel processor and a 100GB hard drive.","It offers two hard drive bays internally, so you may add extra storage without the need of a external hard drive.Also, overclockers will love this machine as you can stably overclock the 1.8ghz processor to 2.0ghz with no adverse effects (aside from lower battery life).There is a built in IR sensor for the little remote control that comes with it, but according to a recent HP BIOS update, this IR sensor will also work with the Media Center Edition remote, although I have not tried, since I do not own XP MCE.I have not had any problems with my hard drive in this computer.","The 2.66ghz processor with 512m ram will be more than enough for anything she can throw at it for years to come, the machine is well suited to her needs.","It isn\u0027t powerful enough to play DOOM3 without lags on the lowest gameplay resolution, but DOOM3 is an increadibly demanding game for graphics processors and CPU\u0027s.","Another thing I discovered about the Presario 2190US is that the processor is upgradeable.","Beautiful design, not too heavy for a 17\" notebook, massive hard drive, BLU RAY DISC DRIVE, fast processor, plenty of RAM... it\u0027s all good.","Again, good for what it is, but it\u0027s time to upgrade, Toshiba.Out-of-Box Quality deductions: -4 for annoying bloatware, slower processor and not enough RAM.Price deductions: -0...this is the BEST OF THE BEST in it\u0027s price range.Design: -2 for a cramped keyboard.OVERALL: 8/10 Being a technician on many products, I\u0027ve come to learn that computers are tools.","Sony VAIO VGN-FZ180E/B 15.4\" Notebook PC (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T7300, 2 GB RAM, 200 GB Hard Drive, Vista Home Premium)I own a 1st generation Powerbook Aluminum.","It\u0027s a shame because it\u0027s one of the most remarkable and interesting features of Leopard.If of your interest, I installed VMWare Fusion to run Windows Vista and it barely works, the 1GB RAM of the notebook seems to be reasonably insufficient (Leopard is recommended with no less than 512Mb, Vista too and the graphic processor uses 144MB).","The only place where the Powerbook SEEMED to lag behind was in the processor speed.","However, it is so slight that I am sure most people won\u0027t even notice.As for performance, without running benchmark tests, it is only subjective, but this pentium processor with the faster RAM and front side bus does seem to run a little faster.All in all, I am still happy with this purchase! Although, it could have been better, I feel this model is another WINNER for Toshia! I\u0027ve owned 3 of these.","It had a hot processor, but the DVD drive died completely just two days after it arrived.","The fast processors in these machines generate a good deal of warmth, no matter what, however.","The processor seems really quick and without fatal errors/crashes or lock ups.","I have an aversion to spending over $1000 on a laptop, but gritted my teeth and ordered a MacBook from Amazon because they had a great price and I trust them.What a computer!!!

Having looked around a bit and learning of Vista\u0027s memory requirements, I was convinced that I needed 2 GB of RAM... well, I think it was a wise move....","These machines have a higher incidence of motherboard issues than the statistical average for laptops.","This can be avoided by muting the motherboard speaker by pressing a button on the keyboard.The palm rests feel great, the screen looks great (although don\u0027t plan on taking this outside in broad daylight - unless you\u0027re in shade.)","I wasted about a month on their incompetence and deception before they called me and said I have to pay for the motherboard because the motherboard is not under warranty.","After a year the hinge mechanism broke, destroying my display and apparently a portion of the motherboard.","On one, the backlight went out, and the other the motherboard and/or CPU went on the fritz.","The only problem that I\u0027ve had with the system was a motherboard problem, which Gateway fixed without issue.","It has new Inspiron 9100/XPS motherboard, Radeon Mobility 9700 128 MB video card, 1 GB DDR @ 400 MHz, and Pentium 4 HT at 3.20 GHz 800MHz FSB, 512KB L2 caches.","I played all those games though without updating the video card drivers, newer drivers are available for the motherboard/video card on nvidia\u0027s website.","They had to replace the motherboard, so I though it was fixed.","8 hours of battery life for ~$150 is the deal of the century.My only issue is when you turn on, wake up, sleep, or take power in or out, the motherboard speaker makes a LOUD beep.","If you buy one of the higher-end models, say the one with the DVD drive, you may find that watching a DVD on this small screen is not exactly the cinematic dream that you find on the amazing Titanium Powerbook G4 (with its glorious ultrawide 15.3\" screen.)Enjoy! Almost a perfect laptop....I owned 4 IBM laptops prior to this Macbook Pro 15, 2.4GHz, 2GB Ram,160GB HD.I used my Thinkpad X series for 3 years and finally it is now experiencing random blue screen of death (due to faulty aged motherboard or memory modules), which I am reluctant to buy replacement parts or repair (old 1.8GHz Centrino).This is my second Mac (I bought an iMac 20\" one year ago and really love it).","this acer ferrari beside the nice design it does not deserve any penny,i will never buy such item like acer ferrari ever,acer are one of the most low quality computers,i got one 1 year ago and crashed when i was recover the system operating,it is down and acer are not able to help me,they ask for more than a half of the computer value to replace the motherboard when the problem was with the bios flash......","However, we have had no issues sending them back in for repair...usually new motherboards.","After 13 months of using this computer the motherboard died and as someone else already said, it costs over 400 dollars (if you are in the USA) to repair it.","HP DOES NOT HAVE THE REPLACEMENT MOTHERBOARD FOR A COMPUTER THAT IS PRACTICALLY NEW.I bought for my daughter a similar laptop but with a smaller screen.","Sony not only will require you to buy expensive external equipment to diagnose *any* problems (of which there are MANY-my motherboard died horribly, took out most of the guts with it) causing you to spend almost $500 more to do *their* jobs for them.Don\u0027t even think about spending money on an extended warranty, its just a way for them to get your money and then, again, they make you purchase more expensive hardware to do any diagnosing before they will even talk to you on the phone.Sony is not a company I will be dealing with ever again...buy ANYTHING but a Sony... you can\u0027t afford all the parts you need to do THEIR job for them.","Power adapter socket is soldered directly to the motherboard -- over a period of time, bumps and tugs to the plug work the connector loose from the motherboard, as opposed to being connected by a wiring harness.","Needless to say they did not send the detail.I sent the $1300+ laptop to an outside repair shop that replaced the motherboard for $300.","Better a cheap power supply than a cheap motherboard I guess.","Google Hp tx1000 wifi or motherboard and you\u0027ll see they use bad parts.","If HP successfully (and enduringly) mends my wireless problem, I\u0027ll update further.Overall, this is serviceable, but the jury is still out.XXXXXXFollow-up, April 5, 2007: HP returned the repaired machine, complete with a new motherboard, within a week of my request for repairs under the warranty.","I have always liked Toshiba but after wasting so much money on one I will never get another.Pro\u0027s- Very nice looking machine loaded with features, nice sound (for a laptop), and very clear and bright screen.Cons- noisy fan, runs hot which probably contributed to the short lifespan .Power supply also gets very hot.Toshiba mobile services NZ wanted to charge me $1500.00 for a replacement motherboard and provide just a three month warranty on the repair.","The real disappointment is Sony\u0027s reaction to this: we have never seen this before (a lie) and it will cost you $700.- for a new motherboard.","And for less than $150! Just 5 months after purchasing my laptop, the motherboard just stopped working.","They replaced the motherboard again, but the machine only lasted another couple of weeks before the keyboard went again.","The repair technician recommended that I replace the motherboard and/or CPU, but was unable to fix it otherwise.I found this 66-page thread too late... but it\u0027s enough to keep me away from purchasing another Vaio to replace this broken one:http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/5449/?o\u003d0 The laptop is very light which makes it great for students or others who shlep their laptop a lot.","Screen lines and motherboard.","My parents bought me a Compaq Presario on my 18th birthday and a little after a year, while I was away at college, the motherboard was fried.","I will have to mirror the comments of other people here and on other sites: The motherboards on these are inferior, last 12 to 14 months, and HP will not stand behind their mistakes.","I read forums and found out that this model and other models have a common problem with the motherboard and video going bad.","Sony took back the laptop and replaced the motherboard for free as it was under warranty.","It was replaced.- While my laptop was in \u0027shop\u0027, having its motherboard replaced, the loaner, somehow, had its display damaged in a New York hotel.","They apparently had to replace the entire motherboard.","Very disappointing! I sent the unit to Acer for repair and their turn around was good and they said they had to replace the motherboard.","To add more memory later on, you will need to toss out one of the memory modules (the other memory module is soldered onto the motherboard) Light, easy to use, good looks, I\u0027m very happy with my first VAIO so far.","And now the motherboard, which by-the-way, has to be sent in to be replaced.","Got it when it first came out and I\u0027m happy! I have this computer at work - and in the two years we have used it, the motherboard has gone out, as well as the hard drive.","This may be restricted to the models displaying the Toshiba motherboard defect but my experience matches the others.","I am very upset and aggravated that after 1 1/2 years it would not even power on! I had an e-machines that lasted almost 4 years before the motherboard went bad on it.","The keyboard had to be replaced twice, replaced the processor and finally the motherboard.","I have the last model, the MX35 and in the first year it had 3 motherboards replaced and various other issues that sent it to the shop over 8 times.","This time they replaced the entire motherboard.","Our local Apple dealer took the motherboard out, dumped it in water, let it dry a couple days, put it back together, and it started up just fine.Anyway, great machine.","Two weeks later, my second L2000 arrived and all seemed well until THEY VERY LAST DAY of the 30 day return period, when the motherboard died-- the BIOS wouldn\u0027t even load!Needless to say, I returned it posthaste and have not purchased a third unit, despite their offer of $75 off of any other laptop.BTW, HP has shortened their return period from 30 days to 21.","Turns out this is due to the defective GPU soldered right in the middle of the motherboard.","twice.- The motherboard had to be replaced- Occaisonally when I plugged in the power cord, the laptop froze completely- Lots of whimsical freezing in general, actually- The final nail in this coffin was the hard drive inexplicably ceasing to work just today.I was floored when I was told that lap tops are actually DESIGNED to last a measly two years... this one barely made it to that, and there were tons of problems on the way! I will never buy a Toshiba product again, and I don\u0027t advise anyone to buy a lap top with the brand attached to it! Lemons like this should NOT be forgiven.","They had to replace the motherboard, a fact my repairs slip did not record-- I found that out talking to a Sony tech when I was hunting it down.","It gets really really hot, it fries the motherboard, first wifi disappears, then the whole thing shuts off and it turns into an expensive and fancy paperweight.HP technical support is neither technical nor support.","i have had this laptop for 3 years now, and during the 1 year company warranty and 3 year with compusa, i had the WORST cooling problem...like the other users on this review forum, I had to ice the heat sinc in order to keep my laptop from shutting off abruptly (note folks that this is a security for your computer, if it continues to increase in temperature while it remains on, your hardware may be destroyed due to intense heat)...thus i had compusa replace the whole cooling system...it was a breeze and on a couple occasion had it it abruptly shut down on its own with the new cooling plates (for the new users without a warranty, the best way to maintain the cooling system is to blow straight into the exhaust while holding a damp cloth up to the fan screen, thus you will catch all the dust build-up)...also while i had my laptop hanging from my shoulder, my mustang door came swinging back at me knocking my laptop to the ground causing the hard driv to fail....this is typcial once excessive shock has been encountered...i simply had this replaced...for the next year and a half i had no problems and with all the things filed such as my library of 1500+ songs and music videos i still havnt filled up the lovely 60GB HDD...it is however as we call it today, a good desktop replacement according to its weight...its weight is on the rim btwn laptops that stay at home and laptops you can lug around at school...lately however iv been using a 3rd party ac adaptor and my ground needle snapped off...eventually i believe the temporary solder work i did to charge the unit caused the lcd backlight to short...after much research NOTE* even though your power jack supply is fused to the motherboard, you can have someone professionally un-solder that jack and replace it with another one at http://laptopjacks.com (which is about $25)...and if you can spot what has caused your backlight to go out like mine, (connections, lcd, bulb, etc) generailly it is bound to be the whole screen...all you need to do is go to a site like http://screentekinc.com and they will provide you a brand new screen (with available extra options like XBRITE in sync with the tech today)for roughly around $250 - $300 brand new...","Fortunately, I don\u0027t generally have to use the drive outside my home.Edited to Add: After about 9 months, the motherboard died (with no warning from the hardware monitoring feature of Windows Vista!!).","To make a long story short, HP phone support confirmed that I had some sort of hardware problem (most likely a bad motherboard or overheating issue) but they would not let me ship them my laptop for warranty repair because they could not confirm the date of purchase, despite the fact that I provided them copies of my receipts several times! I wound up taking the unit to a authorized HP service center - CompUSA - and they were able to get the unit fixed.","It\u0027s even fast (see its motherboard frequency with respect to CPU\u0027s one).But having it all the time with me doesn\u0027t feel comfortable - it\u0027s 3.5kg heavy.","My motherboard died after 15 months.","What does THAT tell you about the people on here writing these reviews! NO ONE mentions the HDMI out and mixed with the fact that it has the 256MB NIVDIA graphics card, I keep this thing plugged into my 50\" Plasma via the HDMI and watch EVERYTHING on there! I haven\u0027t even had cable for about 18 months now! Using the windows media center function in Vista, I have a true HTPC! I use the included remote control and never have to leave my couch! I\u0027ve NEVER had any stupid hinge problems, NOR motherboard or wireless problems.","They\u0027ll take weeks just to replace a motherboard and return the thing.","They wanted me to pay $800 for a new motherboard! I refused.","My IBM built T40 was just inside the 3 year warranty when the motherboard cracked (a design weakness common to all the T40 series Thinkpads) and that was the only service call I had in the 4 years I used the machine.","3 months into the ownership the motherboard had to be replaced by a friendly lenovo technician.","A few months ago, one latop suffered from the \"motherboard\" disease.","I also had the problem of the \"blown motherboard\".","BUT BEWARE, THEY BREAK RELENTLESSLY! I had a problem from the beginning, the sound stopped working, needed major repairs within 6 months of owning! Then Just after my extended warentee ran out the thing died all together! Out on nowhere the motherboard just crashed! This was after only two years of ownership on a pricey laptop.","I know that is an odd comment but I\u0027m a clutz and the plug prevents me from flinging the computer across the room.Also the independent video card (seperate from the motherboard) allows me to play games online (my current favorite is World of Warcraft).The screen is large and has beautiful picture.","For the motherboard and the hard drive I was on the phone several times a day for a month and still got no response from them.","I spent over an hour deleting it and installing real anti-virus software (AVG).- The video card is integrated into the motherboard, meaning you CANNOT UPGRADE the video (I confirmed this with Gateway.)","Since then, I\u0027ve researched this model and other Sony models on the net and found that lots of people have the same issue and Sony expects them to pay $800 for new motherboards.","It has been back to Sony twice and has finally crashed with its third bad motherboard.","Contact HP support via Internet of course because I could never find their help number and they had me flash the motherboard with a new Bios.","when i called toshiba, they say my laptop motherboard, screen and processor died.Its amazing that within 2 month all majour part of the laptop is dead!!!!above all toshiba is not able to fix this problem in 3 month!!! how people can trust toshiba in future??? i put negative infinity point for this laptop as well as toshiba.i\u0027ll never buy any toshiba product in future....","I\u0027ve owned it less than a year and the motherboard already had to be replaced.But my main gripe is with the Toshiba Tech Support people.","Laptops from HP suffer a fatal design flaw and the motherboard will DIE.","The motherboard will fry shortly after a year.","It\u0027s well known that it\u0027s abysmal at best.After the second laptop motherboard issue, I\u0027ve learned my lesson -- and it cost me quite a few dollars.","The motherboard on this machine, which has been sparingly used since it was purchased in October 2002, failed in November 2003, a date approximately one month after the expiration of the manufacturer\u0027s warranty.","I put the computer in, they picked it up, and I receive the computer back the next evening, with a new motherboard.","The card wired into the motherboard.","The repair shop repairman advised me that the motherboard interface with the Wi-Fi card is defective and he will now ship the computer to an official HP repair facility.","I took mine to my main nerd to make a backup of my hard drive (which I couldn\u0027t very well do after it died) and he confirmed that \"yeah, your motherboard is toasted.\"But since this is a known defect in the NVIDIA chipset, HP will take care of you, right? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH not really.","So it was taken to HP where they replaced the motherboard and everything was back to normal.","There are several workarounds for this problem, ranging from the field-expedient of inserting a folded piece of paper over the problem RAM slot (this is said to hold down the DIMM enough to make it contact properly) to outright replacement of the motherboard with a properly working unit.2) The LCD front bezel is rather flimsy.","The unit I bought spent more time in the repair depot than me using it.Today I sent it for repair for the 5th time in less than a year.You name a problem - it had it - faulty motherboard, hard drive, keyboard,motherboard again.Customer service is not better than computer - they refuse to exchange iteven after so many times being

Come on, guys!), average soundcard (but this is no problem with the plethora of USB and PCMCIA soundcards now available), and not the maximum graphics RAM (64MB... would have expected 128MB in an extreme machine like this).When all is said and done, though, I\u0027m stoked!

Don\u0027t look here.Need a PORTABLE PC...?Get an Averatec ! I had been researching on ultramobile PCs for quite a while and even looked at the Asus Eee PC, which is cheap but has a terrible low-res low-quality screen (and weighs a hefty 2 lbs, the same as my Sharp PC-MM20 *real* laptop with more memory and a 40GB hard drive).","Lies! The hard drive after \u0026quot;replacement\u0026quot; has the same serial number and it is the same old defective modem ( though they replaced the phone jack!).","Also after less then a year the hard drive breaks, not to mention it gets very hot very quickly.","So I can only say once installed with Windows after I reformatted the hard drive it is FAST, reliable, and I find myself using it at home even with my dekstop quad core sitting about 6 feet away.","MACS have alot of ram, kick butt graphics/video cards, and have more hard drive space than any other laptop from gateway, intel, compaq,Spartan, Toshiba, or Dell.","With Windows XP, in lieu of Vista, only 16 of the 60 GB hard drive is used...and that includes the full suite of Microsoft Office 2003 and several other larger programs.","Of course, at this point we\u0027d reformatted my hard drive several times, also to no effect.Finally it was sent back to the factory, ostensibly fixed and sent back to me in April.","It would also not play movies from your hard drive- No AccuPoint (or similar) device, only touchpad.- Touchpad\u0027s scroll area sometimes would let-the-scroll-loose- Very little functionality could be added to the touchpad (I would like to see tapping on the corner open some program or maximize the window)Overall, it seems to be a great notebook (I will use it for Office programs, some strategic games, movie watching, etc) for my purpose, and will update the info if something else comes up.","I got like 2 hours off the thing with the screen turned down.)Hard drive was the typical slow loud sony hard drive.intagrated video card.","Hard drive setup.Default is FAT32 on the hard drive split 50/50 onto two partitions.","Within 3 months of buying it the hard drive went out.","And just like the Satellite Pro, (I bought both directly from Toshiba btw, but this doesn\u0027t grant you anything), the motherboard/Hard drive had significant problems, only with this one it occurred only a week after I purchased it.","I chose to purchase this over the Compaq 1720US because of the addition of an extra USB port, PCMCIA slot, and better graphics card.Unfortunately, I have had the same problem with both machines, a loud whirling fan and a clicking hard drive.","The other 20GB of space is strictly for back-up \u0026 recovery \u0026 not user accessible.For a nice reasonably priced laptop, it\u0027s not bad set up the way it is originally, \u0026 if you\u0027re not that tech-savy the split FAT32 hard drive may be a life-saver for you with the extra back-up.Norton Anti-virus is no big deal, is extremely buggy, resource hungry, \u0026 will bog down your system.","Anyway, this one is certainly a powerhouse, with a bigger processor than most home systems today, coupled with a mediocre sized hard drive (especially when one considers this PC is designed to be a media center, with its very good graphics and CD \u0026amp; DVD player) and a very crisp display.The drawbacks here are important:1) The 2.8 P4 processor is not ideal for mobile use.","It only has a single hard drive, yet somehow it\u0027s set up as some sort of RAID configuration, or at least that is what it is meant to think.","I called customer service about this and they informed me that everything i needed was backed up on a 2nd partition on the hard drive.When i buy a computer with a 60 gig hard drive, i expect to have a 60 gig hard drive, not a 40 gig with 20 gigs that i can\u0027t use because its reserved for backup space.","The laptop started freezing up half a year ago, because I kept it on all the time and it would sit there and bake, so replacing the hard drives again did the trick.The laptop is huge but it sits on my lap without burning my legs.","This secret is only available when one locates the PDF manual on the hard drive.","And the hard drive could be bigger.","While the second, the 5105-s501 had some issues with the hard drive, installing the fix recommended by Toshiba resolved those issues and I still have this laptop working in top condition!Now, the M45.","My hard drive crashed and i had to spend like 200 dollars to get it fixed.","The huge 200 Gig hard drive is suitable for the masses but I wanted a faster spinning HD which I got.","If you have any questions about it, click on my profile and send me a e-mail.UPDATE: After 14 months, the hard drive started making noise and system performance got slow and I couldn\u0027t run as many programs as I used to.","sound disturbance, restarts with our wanrning, got problem with mother board 4 times in 2 years, needed to change hard drive 2 times,needed to change the DVD drive.i bought this laptop with COMPUSA and all the products i brought with them sucks.","I wasn\u0027t sure that it was really all that High-Def, but when I watched the trailers for Hitch and Resident Evil 2 on the disc (in the extras), they were also in High-Def, but MUCH clearer and look amazing.Pros:+Very fast Processor T7400 (2.16Ghz x 2, 4MB cache)+2 GB of RAM+Blu-Ray+15.4\" Widescreen with WSXGA+ (1680x1050 resolution)+Light-weight at only 6 lbs and barely a inch thick.+Battery life is over 3 hrs, sometimes 4+ hrs when on max battery save mode+ Barely ever uses the HDD in regular use, has so much RAM it just stores everything there.Cons:-Tons of ACER crap that comes with it (it takes about an hr when you first turn it on, to install of the ACER stuff, it does it automatically)-Hard drive is partitioned into two 80GB FAT32 partitions, which sucks for big files over 4GB, which don\u0027t work, unless you uninstall it and then use the backup DVD you make when it boots to install the drivers and special software.-ATI driver is proprietary and huge! 500+ MB-Speakers are very high pitched, squeaky and poor in comparison to my 8 yr old laptop-Acer website is slow and no drivers on it yet for this laptop-Screen is dark compared to my other 2 laptops, even on highest settings, the screen is only about half as brightI also bought the 3 yr Total Replacement warranty which makes my laptop insured until 2010, when I can upgrade it again.Overall, I am VERY pleased with my purchase.","SO...Break out your old Windows 98 disks, format the hard drive to one big C drive and then load your own version of XP on it to upgrade.","And I\u0027ll be getting a 320GB hard drive by then, too.ADDENDA (last one, for sure!)I DID upgrade to Windows 7 and am glad I did! Very easy installation for the 32 bit version.","They put a new hard drive on the machine after and fixed a broken key.","I had to have the hard drive replaced with a brand that was not HP and reinstalled all the original things from it.","My workis based on computers, and I have never experienced a bettersystem.(+)-Always dependable, never fails to run properly.-Small \u0026 easy to transport.-Interface is extremely easy, good for people new to computers.-Display is great, pictures and videos have never looked this good.-Widgets are really useful!! i.e. Maps, Sport scores, Weather, etc.-iLife has great apps, iDVD, iMovie HD, etc.-Supports: CAT5, FireWire, USB(2), Monitor-output, 56k!(-)-The OS takes up over 10GB of hard drive space, reallypissed me off when i discovered that.-If you\u0027re running it with the standard 512MB of RAM, it\u0027sprobably a good idea to go up to 1GB-fragile keys! when i went to install RAM, one of the slide-outkeys snapped off!! had to fight with Apple rep. to get fixed underwarranty :(-gets hot pretty quickly, its a good idea to be a well-circulatedarea when using.-PC users beware, you\u0027ll discover finding some Windows appscompatible with Macs can be quite difficultdon\u0027t be discouraged! this is a great product \u0026 if you\u0027relooking for a laptop..","It is also important that you remember to backup your important files to either another external hard drive, or DVDs.","Its hard drive never crashed, and hope it won\u0027t because I want to reformat it soon.","For me, however, this is not a problem - I am rarely away from an AC outlet, and having Pentium 2.8 Ghz. speed makes up for the battery life.Secondly, nearly 5 Gb. of hard drive space is used by the recovery partition.","The screen resolution is excellent, the memory and hard drive are substantial for the price and the workmanship and features are good.","So I am left with a hot piece of plastic, Toshiba has now stopped even reformatting the hard drive though they are willing to send again a box to take this this back to Memphis- where I already know what they do.The one star is for audio/video if you want to listen to music or watch movies.I think I have a lost cause but I am posting this review so that people who buy Toshibas with their hard-earned money know what they are facing.","This is one of the greatest pieces of electronics ever created.Wish there was more hard drive memory, but if you store files online you dont really need all that much hard drive space.I also wish the battery life was better.But other than those two things its a must have.Joel Simkhai It\u0027s a good computer, for sure, but the battery....","The Hard drive is big enough to hold all my music and video\u0027s.","I have not once taken it in for a tune-up, repair, inspection, ect.The only minor hindrances are as follows:The keyboard doesn\u0027t light up which makes typing in the dark difficult.For some reason my hard-drive is almost full so everytime I search for something in the search bar, it runs really slow.It doesn\u0027t use an IBM processor so I guess you can say it is a true blood mac, which makes some programs incompatible.Now the good stuff:I actually think that if you consider it was made 5 years ago, it is a better computer than what apple makes now.","Still never worked properly and ever since they replaced the hard drive they will not do anything else, claiming that the motherboard and hard drive are the computer and that there couldn\u0027t be anything else wrong - except for the user.","The original hard drive is still functioning 5 years later.","If you have the money I\u0027d upgrade to a larger hard drive, and if you already own iLife 07, there is no need to update to iLife 08.","Performance is more than adequate when I run Macromedia\u0027s Dreamweaver and Fireworks applications, Microsoft Excel, Word, few browser windows, and Outlook email at the same time.Here are few complains;

does it reformat the hard drive and ship it back the same day.","Overall - I love this machine and will use it for a long time Here\u0027s why I\u0027d rate this computer a 5 out of 5:First off, the specs aren\u0027t too shabby for less than 900 dollars, IE, Celeron-M 2.40 Ghz, 256 Megs of Ram, ATI Mobility Radeon 7000 (this thing gets 128 megs of shared video memory if you go to half a gig of Ram), 1024x768 at 15\u0026quot;, 40gig hard drive, DVD/CD-RW drive, Firewire, 2 USB ports, 5-One Touch buttons, Touchpad On/Off button (very handy if you are typing something lengthy and constantly have to rest your arms on the touchpad), VGA port, Serial Port, Parallel Port, PS/2 Port, built-in 56k Modem/10/100 LAN combo, Mic Port, Headphone Port, mute button, volume controls on the side of the machine, and an S-Video Port, all weighing just around 6.5 pounds and getting a LONG 4.5 hours from battery.","I ended up losing everything on the hard drive without any warning that there was something wrong.","This was -the- deciding factor against a larger Powerbook.Overall, I was super-happy with it, except that I had a couple of hardware problems: Within 60 days of my purchase my hard drive died and had to be replaced.","The 80GB hard drive provides plenty of space for most users needs although don\u0027t expect to put too many digital video files or else you might fill it up quickly.","Best buy for everyday and student use!

gone down in two years, HD-DVD was very expensive two years ago and is now no longer even relevant, and the two (yes, two!) hard drives that come with the unit are slower than mollasses and MUST be replaced.Detailed review:I\u0027ve owned this thing for almost two years--it around June or so in 2007 I think.This laptop has been a true workhorse for me as a software developer, gamer, web surfer,

I immediately upgraded the memory to 4GB; although I knew with vista I could not take advantage of the entire 4GB.The Duo processor does support 64 bit , so I\u0027m upgrading to Windows 7 to finally use all 4GB memory and most of my applications should perform fine.I did use my extended warranty twice this year for damage I caused! The only issue I have is the fact it does not support the installation of a 2nd internal hard drive although the space is available but no connectors.But for the price I paid, I\u0027m happy! Got it from local CompUSA, the last week it was in bankruptcy business!One discrepancy, the laptop has 6 USB slots not 4 as indicated in the technical description.Toshiba Satellite P205-S6347 I purchased this laptop not too long ago, and so far, it\u0027s proven to be very nice.","The fan and the hard drive.","The new iBook is my first Macintosh and portable computer..and to say the least I now feel both portable and well equipped in my computing needs.My version of the iBook comes with 1GB or memory and 60GB Hard drive, custom built.","So I don\u0027t regret that I purchased this laptop because it is very light and performs great on 3D games.3DMark score was 768 which is about the same as Desktop intel 2.4GHz with Geforce 4 Ti 4600 can perform.I could play Unreal Tournament 2004 Demo (yes, demo just came out!!) w/o lag @ high resolution.Only reason I gave 4 stars is that its hard drive is noisy.","When I took it in, they said the hard drive was gone.","A remote would make it nice to use as part of an entertainment center.By the way, Amazon\u0027s specs aren\u0027t quite accurate - This laptop has 2 120gb hard drives for a total of 240gb, not 200gb.Another nice touch about this laptop is that this laptop\u0027s keyboard includes a separate area for a numeric keypad, which is nice - many laptops have a smaller keyboard with the numeric keypad where the letters are.Another thing I like about this laptop is that the HDMI output allows you to connect to modern high-definition TVs, and with an HDMI-DVI adapter, you can use a PC monitor with a digital connection.This laptop comes with Windows Vista installed.","If you are into collecting videos of concerts, a DVD-R is a must.I\u0027d recommend upgrading to at least 768 MB of memory and the 80 GB hard drive.","Of course, the quality of a burned CD or DVD is only as good as the media used - check the AfterDawn forums for media recommendations.Although you will be able to upgrade the MBP\u0027s memory to the 3GB maximum by swapping one of two 1GB memory modules for a 2GB module, Apple does not allow you to upgrade the hard drive yourself.","I think the hard drive started going bad after I reformatted it so many times.","So, I purchased a new hard drive, installed it, and now my recovery cd\u0027s won\u0027t work because the graphics don\u0027t allow me to see the first window of the recovery process.","But its very apparant that this PC can\u0027t handle it which is why it locked up all the time.If you want the PC to run reliably, do yourself a favor and format the entire hard drive and reinstall windows on a clean drive.","My only complaints about this entire laptop is the hard drive speed, and lack of OS recovery discs.","While the notebook has an 80GB hard drive only about 69GB are available for use.","You need to increase Ram (512 isn\u0027t much anymore), a faster hard drive wouldn\u0027t hurt.","There is advertised a 40 GB hard drive.","This hard drive will hold thousands of songs and photos, but you won\u0027t fit much video on here.Even More Wireless - Airport Extreme, for wireless networking, continues to be standard, but Apple has also made bluetooth technology standard, with this iBook.","Personally, I feel the black Macbook is worth the extra $200 since it won\u0027t get dirty and need it\u0027s front panels (where you rest your wrists) replaced and for the larger hard drive (80GB instead of 60).","I own this piece of garbage but I have no one to blame but myself!

I wouldn\u0027t recommend this PC or any PC formatted in FAT32 if you don\u0027t plan on converting it to NTFS... unless you want everyone to have access to your PC!... so... after the easy fixes, it is a 4 star computer... before it is a 2 star... but for $1,000 less than a Dell with the same specs, its worth the 10 minutes you\u0027ll put in converting the hard drive and removing the partition, if desired.","Mine has 40 GB hard drive (it boots in either Windows XP, or Red Hat Linux), and 1 Gigabyte of RAM, the maximum amount this model can be upgraded to.","It is the easiest computer to upgrade a hard drive or CD drive on that I have seen (in fact, with some computer hardware experience, switching out the insides of the CD-ROM module for a more powerful DVD drive is simple.)","I used both hard drives just as rigorously so I think it\u0027s safe to say that Mac builds a good hard drive...or at least uses sturdy reliable third party hard drives in their machines.","Now those figures are from one extreme using it constantly, defragging the hard drive, playing games, wireless on, to the other extreme, wireless off, quite a bit of idle time between tasks, etc.Hibernate mode works awesome as it should, with saving and resuming each taking less than 20 seconds.If you don\u0027t mind using standby mode however you can get much more battery life and not really impact the availability of the machine.","This computer is great and easy to use, and it now has WINDOWS XP!!!

The huge hard drive is great for so small a machine, and it turns heads in public every bit as much as the beautiful Powerbook 17 did.","After all, it\u0027s a fall from almost seven feet high; surely the case is cracked, or the screen broken, or the hard drive knocked out of whack and my data lost -- or all of the above.","The package is cute, the hard drive size is enticing, but this is not a product I would recommend.","I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone thinking about making a new laptop purchase.This laptop for the money has more Memory then most, lots more goodies, larger hard drive, fingerprint reader, webcam, etc. then others for the same money.","Especially given the fact that they put a 4200RPM hard drive! Upgrade to 1GB of RAM is strongly recommended but for general tasks as web surfing and typing 512MB is ok.","Second, the hard drive starget going bad.","Great for DVD copying or system backup.OTHER POSITIVE COMMENTSQuiet: The sound of the hard drive is surprisingly low - I barely hear any noise during start up.","By the 18th month, the hard-drive crashed completely - beyond repair.","Hard drive size is good at 240GB, multi-card reader is a great feature, and the AMD TL-64 chip seems to be pretty speedy but all that power runs awfully hot so you won\u0027t want to work with the computer on your lap for too long unless you\u0027re out of hot chocolate on a frosty winter day.","I did have my harddrive crash but I took it to the place I bought it and my warranty did cover the hard drive.","With the exception of the hard drive failure, NONE of the failures were catastrophic \"I cannot do any work right now\" type of failures, so the system is robust.The IBM repair manual is fantastic so I buy new parts on ebay and repair it myself.","The lower-end MacBook Pro hard drive is a 120GB, 5400RPM Drive - this, oddly, is smaller than the 160 GB drive that is in the top line MacBook that is several hundred dollars less.","There are a few other nice touches such as the touchpad quick launch feature (quicker access to certain features without returning to the desktop and/or Start menu), the wireless \"mapping\" utility (for identifying available wireless networks, including bluetooth devices), and movement detection (which causes the hard drive heads to be \"parked\" in a safe location to avoid accidental damage).The screen is adequate, without being anything to get excited about (no improvement from a previous Port\u0026eacute;g\u0026eacute; bought way back in 2002).","I use this notebook as my desktop replacement.- Hard drive space: 20GB is huge for what I do.- Little scroll button: quite helpful.- Speakers: JBL Pro are absolutely the best.- Combo DVD/CD-RW Drive: more convenient than swapping like Gateway.Things I dislike:- Little buttons at the top of the keyboard: Can\u0027t figure out how to change what they do.- Windows XP: Takes a while getting used to compared to Windows 98.- The stupid sticker that came on the screen: A bugger to get off, I still have a little stickiness on the screen.- The stickers advertising AMD and Windows XP on the corner of the keyboard: I have scratched my arm several times.That\u0027s about it.","You\u0027ll find that the 60GB hard drive may not be enough.","A bright, clear screen, large hard drive, speedy processor, wireless LAN, smooth touchpad, and longer-than-average battery life all tucked into a tight and inexpensive 12-inch package.","(ok, rant over.)- 200GB Hard Drive?

will turn on but not find any networks when I am right next to a router; will find networks with good signals and not connect; will connect but not send anything)- Hard drive is non-standard (can\u0027t replace it with non-Sony drives)- Hard drive is often very slow- Battery life is terrible (less than 1.5 hours at full power, less than 2 on power saver mode) - whoever said it got 4 hours was either lucky, wrong, or using an upgraded battery- CD/DVD drive is *loud*- Integrated speakers are terrible- Integrated microphone is terrible, even by laptop standards- Laptop gets *EXTREMELY* hot, even in standby.","The video performance will be limited by the speed of the RAM which, as mentioned above, is not very good for DDR.Hard Drive: Hard drive performance is a bit weak.","I have not test ran the DVD writer yet but I have managed to slip about 30 GB onto the hard drive (it always baffles me how hard drive memory gets away so fast).","But I learned that the Mac comes with the ability to make a hard drive partition for Windows, and the drivers to make sure that Windows recognizes all the hardware and makes it function properly.","This computer has a 100gb hard drive, which is quite spacious for one in this price range.","An ample hard drive (160GB) and 2 Gig of memory (this was must for me; I wanted it to handle the applications I was running smoothly, and that was about the max you could find in an out-of-the-box machine at the time).","I would prefer it to be set opposite that, and at the very least it should be user definable.Second: other removable drive systems allow for a secondary hard drive, and so far as I can tell this one does not.","Besides that, the system comes with a poor selection of cheap softwares and games, which in the end eat up 7GB of your hard drive.","The hard drive is to small to add anything, but for my purpose its great.","The hard drive also has plenty of space at 100GB and seems to be fast enough running at 5,400 rpm with SATA interface.The Sony software for audio and video and editing seems pretty good and I haven\u0027t had any problems so far.","You\u0027ll find yourself more productive with its high-resolution display, double layer superdrive, bigger hard drive, and fantastic video output options, with its capable video card.","I\u0027ve had this laptop for about 3 years.I installed Windows 7 Home Premium and added an extra 1 Gb of Ram on it and it works great.The only drawbacks that I\u0027ve encountered are:-The trim on the laptop isn\u0027t very durable (plastic fades easily).-The fingerprint reader/software won\u0027t work with Windows 7-Battery life is lacking (less than 5 hours)The Pros:+Easy access to Hard Drive and Ram ports+Made in Japan+DVDRW drive+Lots of USB ports (5 total)This laptop is faster and more usable than a netbook.","Our tablet pc arrived in a timely manner but shortly there after the hard drive locked up.","By the help of 1GByte memory , enough hard drive and , thanks to AMD , Athlon 3200+ CPU , the computer successfully handle all the hard works .","I was more than a bit disappointed in my new Vaio FRV26, but not for the reasons stated by the other reviewer.My biggest beef is the misrepresentation of the size of the hard drive.","but if you can live without the bells and whistles, this is a fine little machine.out of the box, you get a 15\" monitor, a dvd-cdrw drive, 256mb ram, and a 20gb hard drive.","even with everything wrong with the new vaios, they are not as bad as the hps, they are better-looking, and they were around half the price i paid for the hps about a year ago.i will probably buy external hard drives for these, and hope vista will send me patches for some of my stranger problems, but i think you could do worse than this vaio (you could obviously do better, also.)","The 25 has 1GB RAM and 80GB hard drive, the 27 has 2GB RAM, 100 GB hard drive, the 29 is the same as the 27 except it comes with a carrying case and the exterior has a sleek special shiny coating.","First I had problems with the sound drivers, then I had problems with windows ME program and finally with the hard drive.When the hard drive totally crashed (only 3 months old) I spent almost two hours trying to get help from technical support.","The hard drive came with a 30 GB partition, the extra 10 are unaccessible (unexplainable with such a small drive.","Then the hard drive starting acting up, clicking and sputtering along.","I recommend you buy a 60GB firewire drive to make clone backups of the hard drive.","This time, I wiped the hard drive to eliminate any unseen driver conflicts.","I WAS ON MY DELL D600 (1.6GHZ, 40 GB HARD DRIVE, DVD/CD-RW) YESTERDAY AND A BIRD CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND FLEW AWAY WITH IT.","I sent him the hard drive to see if the novel I was writing on it could be saved; it couldn\u0027t.","I suspect Win XP is a resource hog and the 4200 rpm hard drive is not as fast as the 7200 rpm in a desktop.","I also upgraded the hard drive to 100GB, which the system handles with no issues.Despite the fact that the processor is the older single core vs. the newer dual core intel and AMD models, the performance is still comparable.","Not only will the price fall, but the speed and quality will undoubtedly increase too.I\u0027ve had every laptop hard drive fail on me throughout the past 5 years.","I\u0027ve replaced the battery after it didn\u0027t take as much of a charge, and a couple of years ago installed a larger hard drive.","Let\u0027s hear it for the service plan!

Considering all the planned obsolescence and the fact how fast are the new models brought to the market and then replaced with the \"newer better\" versions, I was surprised to see this laptop still being sold.I have owned it almost 3.5 years by now and have sort of mixed feelings about it.It definitely is powerful unit with plenty of storage and high enough processor speed, and I have used it instead of desktop all this time, and have, of course, grown attached to it and rely on it heavily.","2GB if you want a smooth run these days, but anything under 1GB is going to give you headaches.80GB HD - Vista-related programs are probably going to take a huge chunk out of that, DirectX 10 programs will be heavy, and with hard drives becoming cheaper by the months, you\u0027d expect 120GB from a budget notebook.nVidia 6150GT - Normally this is a good thing, but it\u0027s a battery killer.","As for the available hard drive space... there is a recovery partition (Drive D:) which takes up about 10GB.","1000 screws on the back to undo, undo hard drive, wireless card, memory, keyboard.","Ours is a Core Duo and since i\u0027ve upgraded the memory to 1 Gig total and a 100mB Hitachi 7200 RPM hard drive.","i have read from others and am experiencing myself, the hard drive clicking about every 2 minutes or so.","Hard drive crapped out6.","I would recommend this or the models with a lesser hard drive to save money in a second, I love it so far.","I thought about selling it before another hard drive goes out, but I like this way too much to get rid of it.","It is in repairs and being repaired since 2.2.2006 with the same problem for 6 times now.This laptop has 4th hard drive, 3rd motherboard, 2nd graphic card, 2nd cooling fans and who knows what else.","I have no idea if HP changed the computer structurally but HP did upgrade the hard drive memory and other smaller features.","My solution: I bought a Western Digital external hard drive.","HARD DRIVE SPACE: This is my only true gripe.","The touch sensitive media buttons offer quick media access, lower the volume, mute, pause rewind etc...The laptop is finished in a high gloss finish but surprisingly doesn\u0027t show finger prints much, using the provided microfiber cloth will remove any once visible, the screen is also a glossy finish and is very reflective to remedy this simply increase the screen brightness by holding fn and pressing f8, with the screen on maximum brightness any glare is gone, lower the screen brightness while in unlit rooms by holding fn and pressing f7.Vista Premium on this laptop is extremely fast, I have played both Gears of War and Resident Evil 4 on high settings very responsive, no poor frame rates, photo editing is wonderful as well as video editing, windows Media Center is wonderful again Vista has given me no issues and I love it, waiting to see what the SP1 update offers, you can get either the advertised laptop from amazon which is very similar to mine 100mghz faster cpu won\u0027t be noticeable but the lower heat and better efficiency my 45nm cpu offers makes me happy.The laptop is very thin, sleek well designed and light being a 15.4 inch screen, 250 gig hard drive offers amazing capacity and I already have several games on my hard drive as well as hundreds of pictures with about 1500 songs still 178 gigs left, I highly recommended this laptop and have been using mine bought from Hp for one month now only problem I encountered was when I left my 4 gig usb flashed drive plugged in and tried booting my laptop it froze simply removing the drive and restarting worked.","It freezes and I have had to erase the hard drive multiple times.","Good battery, fast processor, plenty of memory both hard drive \u0026 RAM.","I wish they could dumped the hard drive info on to a refurbished 2710 system that has a better track record.","This laptop has two 100GB hard drives, allowing for 200GB of storage at a steadily quiet 5400rpm.","The powered external drive is not elegant, but if you ever need to do a full restore (and you might because your Air will lead a hard life, especially if it is a student\u0027s life), it will save you a couple of hours if you use a powered external hard drive.","It is clicky and responsive, Key size takes a bit to get used to but is not bad.This laptop is an excelent performer for hundreds less then the comperable dellienware I purchased this laptop for my friend.He wanted to have all the current features(core duo,DVD burner,1GB RAM and 80 GB hard drive,XP professional) in around 1000$.This product gave all these with mutiple other features and also working on it was great.With good after sales support and stylish looks,I have got the best deal.","The aluminum case is un-dented and as tight as ever; the screen unblemished; the hard drive unperturbed.","Maybe you\u0027re new to laptops, so here are a few facts.Sadly enough almost all laptops are tailored for Windows, that means that if you install anything but windows, well you\u0027ll have a poor performance.Also very important, the hard drive that is included with the computer is a 4200rpm HD which is QUITE slow for any standard.When the OS is paging or accessing the HD this speed is critical.I don\u0027t know about your computer but mine had 512mb of memory, and let\u0027s say the full 2Gb could really boost performance.I am a software engineer and I have found this laptop as a decent desktop replacement.If you use it with windowsXP 64, a fast HD and 1GB or more you\u0027ll see what I am talking about.","Add to that the Pentium 3.2 HT processor with 533 front side bus, large 80 Meg hard drive, very fast wireless B/G adaptor even though my router is an old Linksys 11 Meg B standard, and the dual layer 8X +/- DVD writer, the rest of the specs are large 15.4 brilliant screen, full size keyboard, 56K Modem, 1 Fire wire 1394, 3 USB 2, Ethernet adaptor, 1 A/V out, Microphone in, Audio out, and a lot of multimedia and authoring software.Set up is a breeze, the laptop is unpacked, hooked, and run in 5 minutes, you better have things to do right away.","Thanks, Gateway!So the question is, do I take a chance and replace the hard drive hoping that will fix the problem, or do I jusy purchase a new notebook? Decisions, decisions...","hp skimps on the hard drive and video card, but the bottom line is that this is probably the cheapest laptop with a 15\" screen out there.","I brought it to my computer care center at school when HP told me that my hard drive had crashed and been erased and said I had nothing left on the computer and they would have to rebuild it.","The first laptop we bought had a bad hard drive, however we called Amazon and you guys took care of the problem.","You will def need a external hard drive with this unit.There is no software so i suggest you down load open source or if you got copies of office you can use it.One of the best features is it has a long battery life.","After two years in its original configuration I\u0027m now upgrading the current 100gb 4200rpm hard drive to a deskstar 200gb 7200rpm, and the memory from 1gb to 2gb.","No freezing, no crashing, but a lot of rebooting for new or updated software.SPOTLIGHT, and instant finder of files anywhere in your hard drive, DVD/CD bay, IPOD or connected devices is fantastic and easy to use.","But you can always buy an iPod, or even better, you can get an external FireWire hard drive for $0.70/GB on which to store your media.I don\u0027t know why you would pay twice the price for a PowerBook just to get twice the hard drive space and an aluminum case.","Do not buy these if you carry your machine for hours at a time or need it to fit in a glovebox.The only possible upgrades would be to are move to a larger (80 GB) or faster (7200 RPM) hard drive.","Then, there was a repair needed, so I sent it back to Sony, who fixed the machine, wiped out my hard drive, and sent it back, guess what, reloaded with all of the crap.","It is the same G4 processor, but I have a 60 GB hard drive, airport extreme card, bluetooth module, and I upgraded the iBook to 768 MB of memory.This iBook is a great way to step into the world of Mac.","Well here it is, and you can get it at Amazon.com (when its available!) ...The Toshiba Satellite 1415-S105 can\u0027t beat the cheaper HP x125 on any grade except for sceen size (and there is a catch to that).Let\u0027s compare these two models:HP Pavilion xt125CPU: 1.6 GHz Celeron (Built on a P4 core with a smaller cache)RAM: 256 MB DDR RAM - Good20GB hard drive - Good enoughGraphics Card: ATI MOBILITY RADEON 7500C w/32MB - very goodDisplay Diagonal Size: 14 inches - FineLCD Resolution: 1024x768 - Good for a 14\"Toshiba Satellite 1415-S105 (cost 10% more)CPU: 1.6 GHz CeleronRAM: 256 MB DDR RAM - Good20GB hard drive - Good enoughGraphics Card: nVIDIA GeForce4 420 Go w/16MB - pretty goodDisplay Diagonal Size: 15 inches - GoodLCD Resolution: 1024x768 - Not great for a 15\"Summary: The xt125 has a better graphic chipset, and a smaller screen that uses the same number of pixels as the Toshiba.","amazon is always a 5-star in my book! this notebook is great! Model: Qosmio F45-AV412 15.4\"PROS:- Very clear screen.- Very nice sound system.- Huge hard drive (250 GB)- The 2 GB RAM, Intel Turbo Memory somehow make up for the slow hard drive (just 4200rpm).CONS:- HD is only 4200rpm.","Two hours later, when this is DONE and you have a fresh computer, it asks if you want to restore from a hard drive using Time Machine.","Very good product as all Apple products are.Wish it had more ram and a larger hard drive as standard.I like it so much I bought another one for my son.","I also had an 8gb kit of RAM I would replace the 4gb with.I sold my \u0027old\u0027 MacBook Pro with it\u0027s original hard drive and kept the 60gb solid state drive I had been using for a few months.","I purchased this iBook with a larger hard drive (60GB) and more memory, which I received yesterday.Before ordering, I checked with Apple to see if this iBook would support Thai script as I\u0027m moving to Thailand.","For a budget laptop, it is one of the few I have found with a 5400 rpm hard drive, and that has made a huge difference! I also added more memory (512 should be your minimum, but adding a 1 gig module is advised).","Add an EV-DO air card (if it\u0027s available in your area) and you have a broadband true portable that will handle any task.Pros: Good hardware selection (120 GB hard drive a plus), excellent performance, one of the best keyboards I\u0027ve used on a laptop.","I got this iBook, and it is really awesome with all of the software, and I am really impressed with MAC OS X, but I ran into a little trouble with my 30 gb hard drive a couple days ago, so I had to get rid of all my music, and clean out junk to get more hard drive.","These were problems even before the original hard drive died.","Add to that a slower 4200 RPM hard drive where the virtual memory is stored, and you can bog down pretty quickly.BUT, take heart, because this machine uses a fairly inexpensive form of DDR 2700 RAM (200 pin, 2.5 latency, unbuffered, unregistered).","Of course that is not a reflection on the laptop as much as it is on the battery - just get a better one or a spare one.Also need to warn buyers that what brings the price down markedly is the fact that it only comes (at least mine did) with a 6-monh trial of MS Word, Excel, \u0026 PowerPoint, but I solved this problem by backing up my 6-year-old Dell to a 300 gb Seagate external hard drive, and all those apps seem to run on the Satellite off the Seagate drive.","It is faster, has more memory, a bigger hard drive, and bluetooth technology built-in.","It came back again, and then the hard drive crashed within 1 day - hah! Not sure what the repair people are doing, but they seem to do more harm than good.","I\u0027ve had the notebook about 7 years now and it was bought to be a desktop replacement, but I rarely use it - I use my desktops instead.Exactly one month after the warranty ended (and after numerous system restores), the hard drive crashed.","The hard drive was large by laptop standards and there was plenty of RAM.","They were unable to transfer my data to my new hard drive, so I\u0027ve spent the past four days reloading all of my software and applications.","As you can see by other reviews the hard drives (which are made by toshiba ) go bad.","I agree that a 7200 hard drive would make this machine smoke.","But then, right before the one year warranty was up, I had to take it to Best Buy, because everything was going wrong with it (again)! Best Buy told me it needed a new hard drive and it probably needed one for a long time (like that\u0027s what should\u0027ve been fixed when I sent it to Gateway).","It did seem to have an issue with \"wobbling\" idling sound where the subwoofer \"wobbled\" while the computer was idle, but that issue was solved by removing and reinserting the subwoofer module.The hard drive internal layout is screwy.","I\u0027ve also had to replace the power cord, which took 6 weeks.My friend at school also bought this computer for portability, and has had the same trouble: our hard drives mysteriously go on the fritz and the \"Operating System not found\" message pops up.Overall, I wish it were a better system, because the portability is fantastic, the screen is sharp and colorful, and if it didn\u0027t randomly die on me it\u0027d be the perfect laptop.","Therefore, if you have any concern, you might want to see if you can special order from Apple online, or in many situations, you will find the standard hard drive to be acceptable.After the processor advancement, Thunderbolt is the other great new technology included in this revision to the MacBook Pro.","This one has more hard drive which he needs for making picture DVD\u0027s and video.","Expect about 2 hours on normal usage.Since then I have increased the operating speed by adding another Gig of memory (about $80.00) and replacing the hard drive with a larger faster 180 gig Sata 7200 rpm drive (about $120.00) and using the original drive in the second drive bay for video\u0027s and data.","The 100GB hard drive isn\u0027t huge, but on a laptop, it\u0027s not too shabby.","Pros:1- High performance (Video/Divx(coding/decoding)/Game)2- High quality screen (Bright, good contrast, not supporting many resolutions though, maybe because it has a wide aspect ratio)3- Good specification (Good size RAM, SATA hard drive)4- Good features (memory card reader)5- My favorite (Express media Player, no need to boot up the OS to watch a DVD, I love it)6- Reliable (to my experience in these past five weeks)7- Good Audio (Not the best speakers and power output, but it does produce clear sounds not usually expected from laptops in this price range)8- Good wireless reception(picks up neighboring networks well!, but I have my own)9- Good size and design, and not heavy in comparison to other laptops that I have had.Personally, I very much recommend this laptop (specialy to students and HomeOffice owners).","U know..I wonder if my laptop is defective or all v505dx hard drive is noisy but it is real problem in the quiet library.","I purchased the model of this computer with a 60G drive July, and on December 5th the hard drive broke.","If you are into collecting videos of concerts, a DVD-R is a must.I\u0027d recommend upgrading to at least 768 MB of memory and the 80 GB hard drive.","Can be replaced with a higher capacity hard drive later.11.","Variety of uses.Activity monitor- the Apple version of the Windows Task Manager, although this can show you the current status of every hardware component of your computer, including current RAM usage and hard drive usage.Grapher- Wonderful tool for algebra students.","Recently, when my computer became infected, I merely used the backup sector (which takes away 20GB from your hard drive) to reload everything - it was a lot easier than manually reformatting, installing Windows, installing the thinkpad drivers, etc.","I\u0027ll probably add an external Firewire 800 drive for the video work I want to do.- processor speed gets a minor upgrade to 2.4 gHz (from 2.33, or to 2.2 from 2.16 for the lower-end 15\" model - but this is the new Santa Rosa processor - with a faster bus speed of 800 mHz (although the memory speed remains at a max of 667 mHz).For $500 less, the lower-end 15\" model has 128 MB of video ram (instead of 256), a 2.2 gHz Santa Rosa processor (.2 slower) and a 120 GB hard drive.","And this thing actually has a hard drive! and, what\u0027s best: if you lose it or it gets stolen, you\u0027re not out $1300 --- the purchase price is very reasonable by comparison.","Aspyr also said I have 37gb available on the hard drive.","Might be an urban legend, but we lost a SuperDrive, possibly the same way.(6) Backups to Time Machine are more likely to happen if you use a Time Capsule as a wireless router + external hard drive.","And we have the latest revisions.Sorry for the layman\u0027s approach to this but a laptop with a 100 GB hard drive, 1.86 GHz, 504 RAM should be able to handle audio, video, business and Internet software.Remember, the same software works on the older two laptops.","This is a great machine for home users...dual-layer dvd burner is a plus, huge hard drive, but battery life is less than ideal.So if you travel and want a big screen, this is the one to get.","After several calls to Apple Support, it was determined there was a problem with my hard drive, they replaced my hard drive, all while I was traveling in Asia.","Coming from a RAID drive with two 7200 RPM drives on my old system, I can say a slow hard drive makes a HUGE difference.As you can see, most of my complaints are not with the computer itself, but with Vista.","I elected to remove most of it and I used my own personal registration info for the Office 2003 which comes preloaded on the unit.With the least amount of software loaded I\u0027m using about 10GB of hard drive space.","Overall the only other thing I will change is the hard drive, 40GB is pretty small for what I do.","I have a couple thousand music files and about as many pictures along with documents, games,etc. and still have plenty of room on my hard drive.","Anything more in this \u0026 most other average machines will actually slow it down... believe me, I\u0027ve done this before, \u0026 ran tests.The hard drive is dual partitioned in FAT32(which is split in half for back-up \u0026 recovery reasons), which will only give you 20GB of space... some of which is taken up by your XP OS \u0026 other things.","Nowadays, if I tilt the screen more than 20 degrees from vertical, the hinge will give out and the screen will slam down on whichever side it was tilted towards.After two years (i.e. right now), a component in the hard drive has either been broken loose or placed in a spot it shouldn\u0027t be, since my hard drive now makes extremely loud grinding noises if I don\u0027t place it at just the right (often awkward) angle.","Differences from the model here at Amazon: 80 GB 5400 rpm hard drive (faster than A290\u0027s 100 GB), 512 MB RAM, 9700 ATI Mobility, and added applications (Adobe Premiere and Elements).The unit is quiet and cool running.","I do games, audio, web and graphics development, work - until last month, I was all PC all the time.With that said, this is one of the most solid, stylish, functional and FUN - yes FUN - devices I\u0027ve ever owned! The performance, usability, feature set and reliability is peerless and I would be hard pressed to find such touches as a lighted keyboard, magnetic AC power, built in camera, hard drive drop protection, firewire 800, Express card, auto dimming LCD, Ati x1600 graphics, Wifi, Bluetooth, DVI, slot load superdrive, included media remote and the plethora of software features as standard in a portable, affordable PC package.","After working well for a few months, the hard drive and motherboard went bad and I had to send it back for repairs.","I got a Dual Core 2 / 2 GB / 120 GB hard drive.","It was great then but was I recently replaced it with a HP G7-1075 HP.***HP G7-1075DX Pavilion Laptop / AMD Phenom II Processor / 17.3\" LED HD Display / 4GB DDR3 Memory / 500GB Hard Drive / Multiformat DVDRW/CD-RW drive / Windows 7 Home Premium Edition operating system - Pewter I\u0027ve had this notebook computer for just under 2 years and in that time it has been nothing but problems.","(For those of you looking to burn copies of your OS, it\u0027s available through Help and Support\u003e Backup \u0026 Recovery (And scroll to the very bottom) Launch VAIO recovery center.Finally, they take 20 gigs of hard drive space for a backup partition and another 20 gig for the OS which means you have less space than you might think, you are minus 40 gigs.","The hard drive gets very noisy as well.","part of me is wishing i\u0027d blown another [money] for a beefier dell -- would\u0027ve gotten a bigger hard drive than 20gb, a faster video card, s-video out, and stuff like that.","I bought this model (Pentium 4, 512 MB Ram, 80 GB Hard Drive) this last year to repleace a previous notebook model that was stolen.","USB 2.0 and Firewire (a BIG plus for external hard drives) work at top speed.","(It would have been \"5 stars down to 3\", but the slow hard drives HAD to be replaced, they were unacceptable and alone converted an otherwise amazing laptop into a rather sluggish one.)If you are looking to buy this model, forget it, go look for a newer model that uses Blu-ray and takes advantage of 2009-level technical evolutions.But if you are just looking at reviews to find out if it\u0027s a good model--say, you\u0027re considering buying from a friend or from eBay at a lower price--overall, I am very pleased.","On running the vaio hardware diagnostic, I found that the hard drive has bad sectors.","I bought this computer in August and the hard drive has already died and the computer is completely unusable.","The hard drive was making all kinds of noises2.","The hard drive capacity is more than adequate, and easilly upgraded.The next thing I would say is that this little beauty is utterly making me lose interest in running Windows! It began with upacking it from the case.","Fast and smooth, higher end models are `loaded with a 7200rpm hard drive, 2GHz Core 2 Duo processor, and 2GB of RAM\u0027 at amazingly irrelevant expense to the weight-load.Ruggedly a creature comfort and conveniently built ultraportable, it is conducive for comfortable use almost anywhere.","About the only real faults I can find with the T30 are that there are no USB 2.0 ports integrated into the machine (you need to buy a PC Card for that, but they\u0027re easy to get and fairly cheap and will literally plug-and-play install with Windows XP) and that the factory-install 40GB hard drive is a bit too small and, at 4200 RPM, a bit slow for modern purposes.","The typical failure is a really bad/sticky key (1st), a failure of some buttons on the synaptics track pad (2nd), a hard drive failure (3rd), or a failure of the power-port male plug, making it difficult (but not impossible) to charge the unit.","I wanted a laptop with CD-RW and DVD drives, a minimum of 256MB RAM and 30GB hard drive space.","It is really quite, the processor runs really fast, and I love the HUGE hard drive.","I got an 80 gig hard drive, dual core processor and a gig of ram with Windows Vista for under 800 bucks.The speakers are really good for a notebook and the extra usb ports are nice to have.My only complaint is the Toshiba bar that comes installed but you can take that off.","First I had problems with the sound drivers, then I had problems with windows ME program and finally with the hard drive.When the hard drive totally crashed (only 3 months old) I spent almost two hours trying to get help from technical support.","I upgraded the 1GB of RAM to 2GB of RAM and changed the 120GB hard drive to a 200GB hard drive.","I am on my second hard drive and that one is beginning to fail.","I went through the hard drive tests with some \"India\" dude who had a 6 year degree in Computer Engineering, and we found the problem.","The unit comes with an 80 GB 5400rpm hard drive and a 512 PC2-5300 memory (I believe one memory chip only, there are usually two standard slots in the machine) and loaded with basic VISTA Operating System.","Then after I put on all of my photos, videos, and music, I was left with a measly 13.5 gigs, and with the rule of thumb to leave about 10 gigs available for system tasks, I imagine I will be upgrading my hard drive in the near future.The optical drive is pretty slow for a CD-R/RW only drive.","I reimaged the hard drive and reinstalled Windows, it began to crash again within a few days.","It had 16K of RAM, a painfully slow dial-up modem, yet it was so new, small and light, that even airline pilots would come over and take a look at it.My next machine was a Tandy 1400, I believe it was called, which did have disk drives, two floppies to be exact, but no hard drive.","I also opted for the 80GB hard drive, leaving me about 68GB of free space before installing other programs myself.","It has also gotten a companion External Hard Drive, An Upgrade to 2GBs of memory and a wireless keyboard and mouse.","The first arrived with a partially defective hard drive.","The shipping protocol of the computer is excellent, with prepaid shipping containers sent to you, but Apple will charge you an additional $50 to save your hard drive data in the event that it must be replaced, a cost that should not obtain in my judgement given the expense of the add-on policy.","of course, after clicking on this, the computer would not boot again, saying \"no hard drive can be found.\"","After contacting tech support (which is free for the first year) and unsuccessfully trying to re-format my hard drive with the included Restore Discs, I finally had to ship it off to Compaq to get it repaired (also free for the first year).","Wireless 54g was a breeze.The only cons about it for me (and I\u0027m knit-picking here) is the slow hard drive (sub 7200 RPM) which means slow boot times.","My friends father applied some lubricant onto it and it was up and running in a matter of seconds.Besides buying a new hard drive for this computer, I haven\u0027t done any other upgrades.","I am much happier with one 60GB hard drive.","I don\u0027t know why they partitioned the hard drive the way they chose to because it really does not make much sense in terms of backups.","The fan only comes on once in a while, and when it does, it only for a short time.The 200 gig hard drive is great to have.","If you buy one get the most amount of ram and hard drive you can afford.","The stated issues were enough for me.Dell Latitude CPX Notebook (650-MHz Pentium III, 128 MB RAM, 12 GB hard drive) I was suprised to find that people are having problems with this computer.","I had to buy the recovery CD to get the system back up after reformatting the hard drive but it kept doing weird stuff.","At the moment, I just download my photographs and short movies to the hard drive.","This is the safest way to get the system

Powerpoint is pre-loaded)+ Fit and finish are BMW-like (i.e., high speed, low drag)+ Extremely nice touch for Sony to have preloaded a decent anti-spyware application (SpySubtract)and Norton Security (3 month trial version)+ A couple reviewers have maligned the 128 MB Intel graphics card, but using an idependent test site (pcpitstop.com), the graphics card received extremely high marks+ Over-all configuration/performance are similar to machines costing several hundred more (somewhat unusal for a premium brand like Sony)+ Keyboard action is sweeeet -- so is the big and fat 100GB hard drive (can\u0027t ever imagine having the content to fill it up!)+ Comsumer\u0027s Union (publisher of Consumer Reports) continually gives Sony high marks for build qualityCons...+ Sony\u0027s knucklheaded bean-counters decided to save money by equipping the machine with a 7 foot power cord -- I have never (and I mean never ever) seen a machine in this price tier come with such a short powercord (my Dell that I use for work came with a 12 foot powercord); I now have to make a 2nd trip to the store to rectify this albiet small, but nevertheless disappointing shortcoming+ I am surprised that the built in speakers are just this side of acceptable (that\u0027s okay as I live for searching Amazon for fun peripherals!)+ I am also somewhat surprised that there are so few hot (a.k.a. quick connect) buttons for multi-media and internet apps (just two!) -- many other machines come with half a dozen or more+ Would like to see more free software preloaded (this seems to be an issue with most of Sony\u0027s machines: laptop and desktop; high end and low end)+ Touch pad takes a little getting used to (not quite sensitive enough at the default setting)Hope this helped with your search for a new machine! Never again will I buy anything Toshiba.","after installing my favroite programs i relize how much of a hard drive 30 GB2 really is.","Walkman... remember it only has 40 gigs and Microsoft Vista which is HUGE... but you can find 1.8\" toshiba hard drives from 100 gigs to 120 gigs and maybe when you read it 200 or more gigs that you could use to upgrade your Vaio.","I tried it with a Linux LiveCD and it flies!Overall, I\u0027m really happy with it anyways: a lightweight machine, good speed, great hard drive space and the extras that come with it (Yesterday I carried it with me all day and it didn\u0027t bother me at all, great, great, weight).","But the notebooks were supposedly great.)My TR3AP1 worked fantastically for about two weeks, until it completely stopped working -- XP Pro wouldn\u0027t start at all, System Restore wouldn\u0027t work, and I couldn\u0027t even get it back to a point where I could get any data off of it.Turns out they sent me a unit with a bad hard drive.","i bought one laptop and it lasted about 10 days before it had problems( hard drive) so i sent it back and they sent me another.","(At that point the restore process is finished with the DVD and you can unplug the SuperDrive and plug in your external hard drive, whether powered or not.","Optical drives and RAM expansion modules for this model are readily available, as are batteries; I\u0027ve already oomphed up my T30 by boosting the RAM to 1GB, which causes the Windows XP Pro SP2 installed on this machine to run very smoothly indeed, and putting in an 8X DVD+/- writer (I am intending to find a lightweight, portable scanner and a USB 2.0 hard drive next).","I had no problems and dvd runs and burns very well.Battery runs up to 7 hours (no kidding, at low brightness)Fast enough to do anything, 1gb ram is fantastic and 100 gig hard drive is awesome.","You\u0027ll also need to have a sharable Mac, or an external hard drive or external SuperDrive.","I called Fujitsu and Fujitsu told me they have nothing to do with the repair shop!!!

full networking; a built in CD/DVD drive; built in fingerprint reader; bright, high resolution screen; a seven hour battery life even when networked; more than adequate memory and hard drive suitable for all but heavy graphics; the ability to play DVD\u0027s without starting up Windows and a total weight of less than 3 pounds.My first concerns were: Can someone with \"older\" vision and reflexes actually read the screen and use the keyboard?I found that, although bright and clear, the screen is definitely small.","I know they will send cd, then they will probably agree that that\u0027s hard drive.","Newer, expensive laptops have huge hard drives, but 80GB is large enough for most people.","before the fan stopped, you just couldn\u0027t do anything but to wait out (and life is too short, don\u0027t you think so?}4) once the fan started, the heat exhausted from the laptop always mingled with some weird smell, like burning plastic or that smell is from the protective wrapping material around the hard drive? and why it\u0027s so hot? just because panasonic did an unique job to protect the hard drive from damage if dropped accidently from a 4-feet height? and why it\u0027s so hot? why the fan almost has to kick started so often, so randomly and so long? is it because panasonic wrappd more protective material under the keyboard from water damage? yeah, it maybe very tough, but it\u0027s also too hot to put on you lap or keep the fan quiet and not over worked.5) the screen.","But what\u0027s the point?

flash drive, it boots from G.R.U.B. to Openbox (in Gentoo Linux) in 21 seconds -- and this is using sysvinit/OpenRC, not SystemD.I bought an A.C. adapter and hard drive caddy (later on) for about $30 each, as well as a 160GB Samsung hard drive.","We had a hard drive go down on Monday, called Apple Support on Tuesday and arranged a (free) pickup the next day, they came and picked up the computer on Wednesday late afternnoon, they returned the computer completely repaired first thing Friday morning (again with free delivery).","Next, the hard drive crashed quite often in the beginning--Gateway sent me over 4 replacement drives.","I use my other laptop (with an external hard drive) as my media base (music, movies, games) so I should have at least 50 GB on this system for quite a while.","They apparently replaced the hard drive, but when it was sent back to us, it continued its previous behavior.","With the 1024 MB of Ram, it is a fast computer, and the 120 GB hard drive should be more than enough for most people.","The hard drive crashed after 6 months, and I spent many wasted hours with HP\u0027s technical support overseas, ended up having to pay for shipping for the orders I received, and they refused to send me a copy of the warrantly information.","There is alot of bundle software crap that def. can be erased if you want to free up more hard drive space.","it worked better and for a longer time but within 45 days the hard drive was not found by the computer so when asked to return it the company said that they replaced it once and wouldn\u0027t be replacing it again.i didn\u0027t get any answer from amazon about the problem.","I just bought this HP laptop for school, and so far I very pleased with the construction, design and functionality.Mine has 2GB of RAM, 160 GB hard drive, Intel Core 2 Duo, DVD R/RW drive and the built in card reader (very handy).","i\u0027m especially pleased with having a 120 gig hard drive... because having hobbled for so long with 10 gigs i don\u0027t have to constantly throw everything out.","I spent many hours reviewing the services and eliminating those that are unnecessary but that has not helped.I upgraded the RAM to 2Meg, but that did not seem to help much.I wiped the hard drive clean and reinstalled all software.","The Hard drive grinds forever on reboot, despite higher speed ratings than the other two laptops.","But the hardware is delicate.The hard drive failed completely 1 week after the 1 year warranty.","I purchased the 60 Gig Hard drive version of this computer in July, and on December 5th the hard drive broke.","My new (dec. 05) P\u0027book 17\" - fully loaded - is in for it\u0027s third repair.I am now getting my 3rd replacement logic board, 3rd replacement hard drive, and 2nd replacement display.","I wiped the hard drive and installed a fresh copy of windows XP, but had a lot of issues installing all the device drivers that were on the Toshiba restore disks, so I restored the hard drive image to it original out of box state and then just removed all the [...] one by one, starting with AOL.","Besides Sony\u0027s benchmark 13.3 inch XBRITE LCD display - top notch 4 MB cache dual core processor, 2GB of super fast DDR2 RAM, dual Graphic Processor Unit (GPU), fast 160 GB SATA Hard drive and Built-in-EVERYTHING, was all I needed to know.","The hard drive on my 680 did crash shortly after buying it, but close to the warranty expiring.","Its great for multimedia and even video capture,although i use it for game playing mainly and it plays BF2 and HL2 and FEAR without any problems all on high specs.A faster hard drive would be nice,but its not imperitive...I think this is a good value for money laptop, especially if you get it with a rebate.I think the other reviewer was unlucky with the modem, and i have never had a problem with Toshiba\u0027s service before.","I was sold on the great screen, but have had problems ever since.A warranty is getting me a new hard drive, and the customer service person I spoke to said that Sony has had major issues with faulty hard drives.The Sony software that they load on top of the operating system slows it down and cuts your space.","I did install a larger hard drive and it accepted the hardware with no problem.","4 individuals (one brain dead, one total indifferent, one telling my that my year warranty did not include the hard drive and one that disconnected me,) the last tech told me to send it back and it would be two weeks before I would get the machine back.","Great for digital pictures, great for home movies, although the hard drive is a bit small, I suggest buying the opitional 2nd hard drvie for the unit.","With the upgraded 200GB hard drive, I\u0027ve been able to hold all my MP3s, pictures, garageband projects and squeeze in a little World of Warcraft action!My gripes with this machine are very superficial and barely worth mentioning.","Another time, the notebook was returned missing all the covers from the bottom (hard drive cover, memory cover, etc.)This time, the whole computer is missing and the customer support reps do not know the status nor where it is.","Now facing Hard Drive issues + graphic chip (nVidia).Just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","The sound is terrific, plenty of USB ports, and an iLink port (Firewire) are available, as well as a monitor output and a parallel port.At 512 MB of RAM, memory is a little on the small side, especially in light of the fact that the VGA card uses some of it.Now, Sony support is easily the most disappointing ever.I cleared the hard drive in order to upgrade to Windows XP professional (it came with Home edition), and realized too late that there were no drivers included.","I also upgraded the RAM to the max capacity of 2GB and the hard drive to a 160GB drive.Overall, I\u0027d place the downfalls on this unit with the fact that it doesn\u0027t boot from USB devices, but then again, this laptop was made in 2003 and was no longer manufactured after 2005.","To me it sounded like the head of the hard drive hitting against something.","I have converted Macintosh formatted video files to AVI files my dad can use on his PC at work.One note, however; I would suggest upgrading to 1 GB of RAM and an 80 GB Hard Drive.","It is perfect, if all you want to do are the basics:-internet-email-word processing-taxes-watch DVD\u0027s-download music and create CD\u0027sIn addition, it has a 40GB hard drive, so you almost never have to worry about filling it up.","Plenty of hard drive space for music files.","The 505Dx really seems to be targeted at people who want to do digital video or media, hence the extremely large hard drive, relatively souped-up video card, and relatively large amount of memory capacity.","i have had this model since early 2007, and have babied it since day 1.even before i received the laptop, i had purchased the Applecare extended warranty, a Speck crystal clear plastic case, a full keypad/wristrest polymer protector...and besides the two times i openned the battery compartment (once to upgrade the RAM to 2GB, and the other time to upgrade the hard drive to 120GB), this laptop has been in its case.to quote a car commercial:\"every time i turn on my MacBook, it definitely turns me on!\" :o)it runs like a dream..., (i\u0027ve had a Mac performa 5200, fujitsu i-4xxx, fujitsu N-3010, and fujitsu-6231 laptops and this MacBook has treated me the best!)it\u0027s light, fast, dependable, syncs well with my Treo 755p, runs my school apps perfectly...the ONLY real setback is that it is an intel-Mac and as such, i cannot run any of my older Mac OS-9/classic apps.","I have noticed the Windows Vista Premium installed does have a few delays (as noted in other reviews), and this could also be attributed to the 4200 speed for the hard drive, but for my purposes this is an excellent laptop.","Apparently this computer has \"known\" issues, including a problem with the hard drive connector cable-- this is why so many of these laptops inexplicably shut down randomly.","After looking over several models of laptops and owning about 1 new one each year, I drifted away from the super small, lightweights and back to a work horse, this thing seems rugged enough, has enough memory and I just replaced a hard drive in an older Sony Vaio that I had running non-stop for a couple years at the office.So I\u0027m giving Sony another shot.","I think the display is very clear, the hard drive more than ample at 80 gigs, and with Win XP Pro, the final $876.00 cost after rebates from Amazon and Averatec made the deal unbeatable.","then a month later the entire hard drive is fried!! i dont use my notebook for anything other than email and typing notes for school.","There is the good sized hard drive (60GB) and plenty of memory (512MB, standard).","Turns out the hard drive was faulty and needed replacing.","I got a virus and had to reformat my hard drive, the computer takes 2 minutes to boot up fully even after reformatting, and now I am constantly worried about viruses.","But needless here they are.The bad about this ibook1) Lack of a built in mic port2) Lack of a built in IR port3) Lack of bluetooth4) Hard drive is way too small5) Internal mic is not the best6) No PCMCIA card slot7) Not much software or hardware on the Mac market and often companies dont make their mac versions as fancy as their PC counterparts.","The hard drive is a tad slow also, but gigantic for a laptop.","One disappointment is the small hard drive.","It has 1 GB ram memory, 1.8 ghz processor, and 80 gb hard drive.","The hard drive is a bit small at 80 GB, but easily rectified with an external USB/Firewire drive.","I feel that this is all around a very great deal.PROS:- Intel Core Duo T2400 - 1.83GHz isn\u0027t the fastest, but a sweet spot when it comes to performance and price- Massive 120GB HD - Very great brand hard drive, and pretty quiet- Beautiful 13.3\" TFT - I love Sony\u0027s screens- Hybrid Graphics Card - Okay, there is a VERY amazing feature on this laptop.","I think I will end up maxing out the ram, and the 120gb hard drive is a bit small for the type of photography (amateur!) I\u0027m learning to work with... but...the screen is amazing, Vista is less annoying than most people say and otherwise... life is good! It surfs the web and made my trip to Hawaii quite easily--although don\u0027t even try to open it up on most planes as it IS too large :) (It\u0027s pretty light for as large as it is!) I will say that the power cord is showing wear and will probably need to be replaced...","The chirping from the hard drive isn\u0027t too bothersome.","Got it when it first came out and I\u0027m happy! I have this computer at work - and in the two years we have used it, the motherboard has gone out, as well as the hard drive.","Not once has it required any repair.About hard drives: it seems that Sony received a batch of bad hard drives from a vendor, as I\u0027ve seen many S family notebooks in for repair.I\u0027ve used this computer to make \"home DVDs\" of impressive visual clarity (in combination with a Sony camcorder) as well as .wmv movies for web presentations.Pros:- Did a great job replacing a desktop computer- excellent screen... great (but not phoenominal) resolution- very sturdy construction- fast computer- does great multi media- With an invertor, makes road trips shorter via dvd playback- Mmmm, DVDs in bed, too!Cons:- Data reads slowly from DVD (but that\u0027s all DVDs...)- Kinda heavy to be lugged around all the time unless you NEED a desktop replacement.","The 3 USB ports will be sufficient for my mouse, keyboard, and external hard drive, and the computer itself is fast and reliable.As far as Vista vs XP goes: I haven\u0027t had any compatibility issues yet, though I\u0027m certain they\u0027ll come up at some point.All told, though, the widescreen display, 2gb standard RAM, and impressive hard drive all combine to make what is, to me, a very powerful and effective system, the only downside of which is its size, which is also a plus (screen size).","I can keep my entire photo and music collections on the computer, but the hard drive is not quite big enough for a video collection.Battery life is acceptable.","It never wrote to the hard drive and I couldn\u0027t copy to or from other disks onto any other computer.5.","Turned out that the hard drive slipped so I had to get a new one.","WowAnd yet, I have had this machine (with the upgraded RAM and faster hard drive and such) and I still contintue to say wow.This is my first notebook computer, and being a high school student, i needed something fast, reliable, strong, and light.","No idea why the hard drive went.","If you need cellular, I\u0027d say wait.So what don\u0027t I like,Some usability nits with the key positioning, a tad more spacing would be better, rubberized keys perhaps and the most popular extra keys positioned on the outside (like the esc key).Of course I\u0027d love a faster CPU, more ram and a faster hard drive, but I\u0027ll always say this ......This device is usable as it is, when a faster one comes out I may chuck my laptop away for good.","Hard Drive: 80GB4.","Are they admitting that this one is not good?!?Although the laptop is light and sleek, these physical characteristics are overshadowed by its unreliable hard drive and Sony\u0027s unhelpful customer service.","HP Pavilion DV2210US 14.1\" Entertainment Laptop (AMD Turion Processor TL-52, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)is very good HP Pavilion DV6105US 15.4\" Widescreen Laptop (AMD Turion MK-36, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, Super Multi Drive)I contacted HP for warranty work on this item.","My hard drive had just died.","That screen would work very well if not the critical design flaw with the screen cover that bends easily.The Portege\u0027s hard drive also seems to be very well protected: they used a smart sensor that detects abrupt laptop movements and parks the hard drive\u0027s head to avoid damage to the disk.","I did a complete full restore once also and reinstalled Windows but all the problems continue.I have run the hard drive test and it said hard drive was fine but it continues to make the noise and I can\u0027t even take it to lectures anymore.","I ordered my book from the Apple Store with 768MB RAM and 80 GB on the hard drive.","How much of a premium can Apple get away with if you\u0027re looking for a work tool and not a fashion accessory or a new religion? 100 bucks? 200? 300? Certainly not triple what this computer cost.In the end the question is how much is your work, communications and entertainment worth? A lot more than the cost of this computer, but it\u0027s something no PC manufacturer has been able to address: We need reliability and ease of use, not more bling.My solution thus far has been to diversify the risk and buy cheap and somewhat reliable computers, so the chances of all of them failing *at the same time* is lower; that will probably mean trying with anApple Mac mini MB138LL/A (1.83 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, Combo Drive)to see if it can integrate into the pool of computers and lower that risk; in the mean time I\u0027m disappointed by Toshiba and will keep them off my considerations, as well as anything more expensive such asLenovo 765802U ThinkPad T61 14.1\" NotebookorApple MacBook MB404LL/A 13.3\" Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) Blackor as promising asAsus Eee PC 4G (7\" Screen, 800 MHz Intel Celeron Processor, 512 MB RAM, 4 GB Hard Drive, Linux Preloaded) Galaxy Black.Do you have the means to get the best car?

This laptop has 2GB of RAM, but on bootup, the OS, demo software and HP tools take up 1GB of memory.- No restore CD/DVD: HP creates a 8.18GB partition on your 200GB hard drive for a \"recovery drive.\"","The reaction of someone who has never seen it to its size, sturdiness, and form factor is quite impressive.I ichatted with my family without problems with good quality video; the systems overall felt a bit more responsive than my 2-year old MacBook Pro with the first-generation Core Duo chip.If you want a light, thin, sturdy laptop with full-size keyboard, a gorgeous screen, MacOS X (10.5), and you don\u0027t necessarily need a CD/DVD drive (you can buy an external one, but somehow lugging this extra piece around somehow defies the purpose of the MBA), and can put up with not \"optimal\" hard-drive performance, then the MBA is exactly what you want!I would buy the USB-ethernet adapter, though.If you need high-speed performance, FireWire, a high-end graphics card, a built-in DVD/CD drive etc, then the MBA is not for you - but I guess then you would not be looking at this page...;)Honestly, I could not be happier with my purchase.","The hard drive had worked loose in shipping but once that issue was settled all worked well.","I was looking for something that can be a decent replacement for a desktop without paying $2000 for the privelege.This model has a very fast processor (it is Celeron, but if you are like most computer users, anything over 1 GHz is overkill!), pretty spacious hard drive and the ability to record CD\u0027s and watch DVD\u0027s.","The only drawback of this system is hard drive space, but that can be replaced easily enough.Buy one, you won\u0027t be sorry! I read once that Vaio\u0027s are the Holy Grail\u0027s of the notebooks...Indeed they are top quality machines and you pay the price for it...We must admit that there is a bit of Brand value to it as well...But you will be very satisfied with this one, specially if you demand more then just office tasks....By the configuration of it, you know you are looking at a fast machine, reliable, and light !! Definitely a plus..After reading lots of reviews on the internet and seeing it before buying I can account for three issues that Sony could solve at this top quality Notebook (yes, nothing is 100% perfect), things that are to improve something that is at the top of the tide, that does not require an extreme ammount of engineering...1) The fingerprint reader could be place away from the touchpad and buttons..","I have been extremely pleased with the unit so far: great screen, lots of processing power, ample hard drive...","Long story short, total hard drive failure and data loss.","I recommend replacing the hard drive with a Solid state unit since it is blazing fast then and extends the battery time to something realistic.","Are you serious? No where did it state it had no hard drive.","Also, the Windows button is on the top - for me not as big of a deal but other reviewers had an issue with that.However this laptop is a very good laptop other than this, and at a very good price... lots of memory and hard drive space, DVD burner, awesome widescreen screen, and Toshiba is one of the most reliable laptop brands according to Consumer Reports (Apple is by far the most reliable, followed by both Sony and Toshiba).After returning the product I purchased the Sony VAIO VGN-A250 from Amazon.","Mine is a dv4305us HP Pavilion, which has but an 80 GB hard drive, but 2 USB ports, and 512 MB of memory.","Or like in my case I wanted more hard drive so I bought a 100 gig to replace the main hard drive and by doing a little surfing online I found a parts place that sells an enclosure for a second hard drive that fits perfectly into the DVD slot, so since I do not need the DVD very often I have another 100 gig drive in most of the time, how cool is that!? Add to that that it has S video out, vga out plus a keyboard port in case you prefer a regular keyboard when at home.","This one has tons of RAM and a big hard drive, but does not run any faster.","Other than that this HT Pentium ROCKS! It also has a very large hard drive, wide clear crisp screen and a Dual Layer burner.","The issue I have with this laptop is the way the hard drive is partitioned, and the poor recovery disk setup.","They replaced the hard drive and sent it back.","It was even blown up in a humvee.Still going strong, only problem with it is a ton of dings and scratches, the lid doesn\u0027t quite shut right, and I think I might want to swap out the hard drive, for after 3 years, I imagine I am pressing my luck there with all the crap it went through.And it isn\u0027t too big.","With support for up to 16GB of RAM, an Intel i7 quad-core processor, and the ability to install a second internal hard drive and have 2TB of internal hard drive storage (with dual 1TB third-party drives) this latest generation MacBook Pro is serious stuff in an elegant, portable package.","Mine has 1GB R.A.M. and a 160GB hard drive.For a while, I ran it without an internal drive drive, booting from a U.S.B. hard drive or flash drive, or the built-in S.D. card reader (the B.I.O.S. doesn\u0027t recognize the S.D. card as a boot device, so I used G.R.U.B. on a small flash drive to initiate the boot, pointing it to the S.D. card).","I bought this computer thinking that it would be a great tool for bringing to college (the 200 GB hard drive was the main sell), but the screen keeps going blank and the touchpad does not work well.","I took it in to Frys Electronics to have them look at it and try to figure out what was wrong with it, and the hard drive was bad.","As a result, while scrolling the cursor, it becomes jerky when the obnoxious polling happens on the hard-drive.","The brightness does vary as I tilt the screen, but it\u0027s very easy to see from any reasonable angle, it just varies a bit.The Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T7200 gives a crisp feel of speed, and the 5400 rpm 160GB hard drive seems to load files quickly.","twice.- The motherboard had to be replaced- Occaisonally when I plugged in the power cord, the laptop froze completely- Lots of whimsical freezing in general, actually- The final nail in this coffin was the hard drive inexplicably ceasing to work just today.I was floored when I was told that lap tops are actually DESIGNED to last a measly two years... this one barely made it to that, and there were tons of problems on the way! I will never buy a Toshiba product again, and I don\u0027t advise anyone to buy a lap top with the brand attached to it! Lemons like this should NOT be forgiven.","Easily fixed with a Microsoft wireless mouse and the touchpad turned off.The ability to scale up is pretty limited to the hard drive, and at 8O GB and a high spin rate, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be needing much more.The DVD-WR drive is a little noisy, but there is a system utilty that dampens the spin rate/noise when it cranks up.","It took me 4-8 hours to wipe the hard drive, re-image it with a clean OS, and install the Toshiba drivers.","It improves performance greatly.The hard drive is not so great at only 40GB, but I bought a 120GB external hard drive and I\u0027m alright.It\u0027s well rounded for gaming, photo works, music, work-projects (power point, word, excel) or personal-projects (making music files, editing photos, etc...)It\u0027s a pretty good primary computer because of it\u0027s a little bit larger; easier to read the screen, and the keyboard is nice.Toshiba can be difficult sometimes, but if you take care of your computer like I do you\u0027ll be fine.I highly recommend buying the extra warrenty on ANY laptop you buy, because you never know when you\u0027ll spill coffee on it or drop it one morning.I guess if I had say the things I DIDN\u0027T like about this laptop...The screen seems overly reflective at times, seeing things behind me while I type or watch movies can be distracting (seems a little more reflective than other computers)The screen also seems a little floppy, so when you fold it up and walk around it seems to kind of bend and be wimpy... though it\u0027s not, it\u0027s just kind of awkward.The 40GB hard drive is not enough space for me, as I do a lot of advanced computer work and have massive files, along with photos and movies.It\u0027s a little bit bigger than other computers, as nice as that is when you\u0027re at home typing on your desk, it\u0027s a little awkward carrying it to other places and feel like a tank taking up a little more of the table.","I don\u0027t abuse my equipment, but constant repetitive motion of the door popping slightly ajar, and me having to pull it out the rest of the way with my fingers, and then press the CD into the spindle is a recipe for disaster IMHO.The sound from the onboard speakers is anemic at best, so unless I\u0027m using headphones, I won\u0027t be able to enjoy my CDs or MP3s (and with that skimpy hard drive space I doubt I\u0027ll be collecting very many and storing them on the computer).The packaging was sound, the laptop arrived safely with all parts intact, not a mark on it."],"aspect":"hard_disc","keyword":"hard drive"},{"responses":["That\u0027s great if you\u0027re into memory sticks but of little use to those who have cameras with CF slots or USB disk drives.All that being said, if you are someone who has a small home office, or a desk that you use for both writing and email.","I don\u0027t recall what it came with for memory but I almost immediately replaced what it had with 2gb.","Its a nice laptop for its price, with a fast processor and plenty of really fast memory.","Don\u0027t just buy it because it is a sony, as sony means expensive, I figure sony usually cost about 20% more than comparable others.The only complaint I have about this notebook is the memory size, only 256 MB.","The MacBook Pro supports up to 2 GB of memory.","Now they will be only memories because I will never again buy an HP laptop.","It plays movies great, however if you are buying a laptop for the sole purpose of watching DVD movies, look for a model with more video memory.","A mess.9) When will Sony just get over their memory stick fixation? Again, it\u0027s the money: I suppose this helps them sell cameras to people with Sony computers, and vice-versa, but lock-in is BAD FOR CUSTOMERS.","The machine is easily serviceable by the user (adding memory modules, changing the hard disk and cleaning the CPU heatsink requires just a few minutes), and there\u0027s the possibility to replace or upgrade the CPU by yourself.The contrast in the screen might be my only complain, but then again this is a bussiness-oriented machine, rather than a gaming PC.","Yes, you could always purchase the doubled memory (preinstalled is $700/separate is $500) OR you could save your specific files on USB memory drives! Maybe it\u0027s only because I\u0027m a student... but I\u0027ve discovered it\u0027s easier to save all my documents/pictures/videos/web history for each class on these drives (and it also develops my organization skills! lol).","It\u0027s been a year since I got it, and the only time it ever really overheats is when I run a lot of memory hog applications like KaZaa Lite.","The processor and memory are wonderful.","First a disclaimer - I am Sony fan, so with everything in my life (Clie, camera, Camcorder, etc.) takes memory sticks and whatnot, I am almost locked into buying a Sony Laptop.I got this laptop as a replacement to my PCG-GRZ630, which was a pile of steaming crap - literally.","The new computer is \u003e4 times faster on Super PI test (40 seconds two copies simulatenously, old computer runs 85 seconds), so I think it is a great value for the money.It is also very quiet comparing to the old laptop since it runs half the speed (at 800 MHz) when you don\u0027t need the processor power.The only downside so far is that both memory slots are taken, so the upgrade to 2 Gb will be costly.","The GRV 680 has major design flaws, It over heats, the memory sockets break requiring resolder and the power plug breaks loose from the motherboard.","If I had it to do again, however, I might choose to buy a P4 because the Athalon still tends to run a little hot, although I haven\u0027t had a problem with it running _too_ hot.This laptop is fine for watching DVD\u0027s, and I\u0027ve been able to do all of my work on it (including some image-analysis work), but it\u0027s not a good machine for gaming because the 64 MB video memory is shared memory.","When I restored from disk, it took off all HP\u0027s \u0027special\u0027 features and returned it to stable safe XP.Since then, the computer has run like a dream, and though I have bitter first memories of her, I\u0027m starting to love her now.","Although the installation procedure is straightforward, it is hard to remove the tiny screws covering the memory card bay even with the screwdriver recommended by Apple\u0027s installation guide.The screen brightness and crispness is very good although font sizes are small.","Not sure why Sony lists this limit if it works this way, but 384 max is just way too low (for the memory hog that Windows XP is).3) Sony\u0027s accessories are PRICY.","it suports b and g too.*Screen: Very sharp and good looking screen, becuase its a 14.1 screen, its look really wide and view angle is also enough from diffrent angales.*It has Card reader for Memory Stick, MMC/SD etc. this is 4-1 reader, I think which is enough.*Enough ports: Has 4 USB high speed ports, 1 S-Video, 1 Firewire I have made the mistake of buying two averatecs.","Nice fast processor, loads of ram, two 120 gig hard drives, hd dvd player/ burner, TV tuner,256 mb dedicated video memory and all with Vista Ultimate.","The way the notebook comes, it has two (2) 512 MB memory modules and there are only 2 slots.","So either that is broken, or else he got screwed buying a machine that doesn\u0027t have a wifi adapter like the labels say, or else it never worked.I gave it two stars for the lack of dedicated video memory and the networking problems.","It seems to function quite well, but chokes on very sample heavy sounds (meaning that the HD is a little slow and/or 512MB of memory is not quite enough) such as Steinberg\u0027s \u0027The Grand\u0027.","Big improvement? No, but it is good to always improve performance, and an extra 133 MHZ is appreciated.More memory - The memory in the iBook has been doubled, with a now standard 512 MB DDR SDRAM, which speeds up your entire experience on the iBook, particularly, when multi-tasking.","This PC ranks high in the hard drive (4.8), memory (4.3) and processor speeds (4.7), but only meets the graphics and gaming graphics requirements set up by Vista by a small margin (3.1 each with 3.0 being minimum).","More memory costs from $70 to over $200, so you probably want to consider this before buying.The most significant problem I\u0027ve had with it is that it is HOT to touch.","So I purchased a back up.It has 1 gig of memory and a dual processor.","It\u0027s much easier to use when my husband steals my laptop mouse than the other one was.My favorite feature about this laptop has been the Memory Stick drive! I have both a Sony digital still camera and a Sony digital video camera, and when I want to load photos and mpegs onto my computer, I just pop the stick into the side of it: No cords, nothing! The fact that it\u0027s that convenient now motivates me to do it more often than I was before.If I had to find a drawback to this computer, I\u0027d say it\u0027s the fan.","I even had problems with nothing but the original HP image and no added software other than Firefox installed.Vista is such a resource hog that 1 gig of memory is really not enough.","I am very happy with my previous machine T5005-S507 and have replaced it seeking higher speed, USB2, more memory and a larger display all of which are included in this machine.","I sent my laptop off for repair, as it was within extended warranty, and received it back (memory wiped), and had no trouble.","It is a pretty decent laptop for basic use for spreadsheets, word processing, and other low memeory using software.Pros:- Good deal for the money.- 2.4 Ghz processor.- Good memory upgrade.- 40 GB IDE Hard Drive.- High speed internet card.Cons:- The battery charge does last very long.- The video card has only 32 MB of built in RAM on the motherboard.","This software got a simulation view which will show you when your laptop is getting shock or tilting and when it is protected..Good one.ThinkVantage-all softwares Rescue \u0026 recovery,Pc-Doctor at this point,Check this one at IBM.com.This thing weighs 4.76 pounds as specified,I feel that this should be pretty easy to carry around.Includes a 7-cell standard Lithion battery comes on a avg. of 4 hours(approxi.),cons:512 MB Memory,despite the fact it expensive,they gave me a mere 512 MB RAM,(Neverthless I have added an 1GB additional Memory-Runs Amazing )Overall I feel this is a really amazing laptop,might take you sometime to get this one as lenovo has issues with orders (I mean It took me 6 weeks to get this one),But its worth it.Highly recomended for heavy users who are looking for almost perfect laptop I got this laptop and have been playing around for a whole day now.","If I am not doing anything, then XP claims about 350 Mbyte memory, while Vista claims about 800 Mbyte.","I upgraded another 512 of memory and checked the cooling fan and it is working.","I did some minor tweaking on my (memory, drive space, etc), now it is truly a work of technological art! Pretty darn light.","Not a lot of memory (which doesn\u0027t matter because we store things on an external drive), but fast enough for us.","And that\u0027s not all; this laptop also has a built-in webcam above the screen, and a memory card reader so that you can copy pictures from a digital camera (or other device) using a memory card onto the laptop.This laptop also includes several accessories - a TV tuner, a couple remote controls, and a pair of headphones.","DVDs have more memory than CDs and blank DVD-Rs are becoming more affordable.","Needs more USB ports and memory card slots and that\u0027s why I only gave it 4 stars.","It actually moves much faster than my desktop, which has more memory.","Vista premium, 1 gig of memory, 80gig hard drive, Athlon dual core processor, WXGA 15.4\" screen, GeForce 6150 graphics card, 3 USB slots, and the list goes on.To say this isn\u0027t a screaming deal would be denying yourself a great laptop for a great price.","So what do I do now with the 4 USB port\u0027s...?!And all my new documents I need to transfer to my Laptop...?!Any suggestions...?! I got this A13585-s4527 from Office Depot and added 2 gig memory and removed Vista and installed XP Professional.","Other perks include built-in wireless networking and a memory stick slot.Now the downside-the laptop does not have a very large range of available features-you can choose XP pro or home, 40-80GB hard drive, and more memory, but not much else is optional.","Connectivity options abound, including Wireless 802.11 b/g (with excellent range and stability), BlueTooth, IrDA, 10/100 Ethernet, V.92 Modem w/hold, USB 2.0 x3, FireWire 400 x1, S-Video out, PCMCIA I/II x1, and a 6-way built-in memory card reader.","It is pretty fast, pretty inexpensive, doesn\u0027t freeze much, Windows XP is easy and better than Windows 2000, lots of memory, etc.","I\u0027m stuck with a stick of ram I can\u0027t use now---shame on you amazon!With over a gig of memory this machine would be great but as is its just OK and pefectly serviceable.","If you ever have to use the Sony supplied recovery disks they will not restore your system if you have anything but the original 2 512MB of memory.","It\u0027s much slower than the 2 newer desktop systems I have so I\u0027m looking to update the memory and CPU.","they could not get me more \"apple\" memory, they could not put in a bigger hard drive.","Now would someone even want to take this thing in a subway? I don\u0027t.Now sure it may not be able to last a plane ride to hawaii, but it sure can keep all your memories and entertainment.","I only point this out because today with great machines like the MacBook Pro we\u0027re storing more of our great memories on computers than ever before, so make sure you don\u0027t lose them, if something happens to your machine.","that\u0027s why i upgraded on my own to 320GB. and the memory upgraded to 2 GB.so now it\u0027s a perfect machine for me.","So if you are looking at this item, make sure to count the extras that you would have to add to another laptop to make it do all the things this one does.Although the look of a computer is one of the least important, admittedly, it is very attractive and a discussion piece no matter where you go.I do not want to talk about the harddrive size and memory since this will be different in different models.Pros:SizeDisplayIntegrated CDRW/DVD(RW)Integrated WifiIntegrated Camera (Still/Video/Webcam)Centrino (low voltage)Battery lifeMagicGate Memorystick slotThe TOuchpad has special sections that let you add extra functionalityCons:No restore cd\u0027sNo Bluetooth (some models do include Bluetooth) I have the same configuration except a faster processor and bluetooth for eight-fifty shipped directly from HP.","If you take a look product description, it says***Memory: The 512 MB of built-in memory (1 x 512 MB, DDR SDRAM) is a good start for power users, and it offers a faster than average RAM speed (333 MHz).","2GB of RAM is just fine for most things and seems to run the VISTA Memory Monster just fine.","The screen is excellent, Vista Premium Home actually works quite well on it and it runs as fast as XP did on my previous one with 1 gig memory.","However, this machine should have been given 32 or 64 megs of *dedicated* video RAM) Overall, this is a very good machine that would be a great machine were it equipped with onboard USB 2.0 ports, a little beefier video memory, and were it to weight a pound or so less.","He told me I bought an entry level machine and they didn\u0027t hide the memory requirements and that I didn\u0027t do my due diligence (he kept repeating himself over and over with an aggressive loud tone as his way to \"convince me\").","With 40 gig hard disk, 512 meg memory, DVD/CD RW, 15\u0026quot; TFT screen, 1.8Mhz Athlon, 64meg ATI Radeon 4xAGP 3d graphics, built in 10/100 Ethernet, 7.5 pounds isn\u0027t too bad.No Firewire port or 802.11b wireless built in.","Noted that I tried to add more memory with the old HDD but performace was not improved enough to make me feel like a $1700-1800 lappy.","Anyway, there are the numbers I promised.No Halo 2??

Buy one and you will never go back to PC or Windows!Sincerely,Jeff I bought this MacBook to replace a 12\" PowerBook G4 that died on me a few months ago, and let me just say - I absolutely love it.","I did add 1gb of memory for image editing and other memory hog apps.My previous notebook was a VAIO PCG-505, which I used for many years and still works as a secondary wireless web access, but the 300mhz processor and 64mb of memory were finally too small and slow.","If you don\u0027t want to change to OS, you could upgrade the memory if possible to the 2 gig minimum.","It has built in Wireless so you can do a little surfing the web from the back deck on a tuesday afternoon, and a memory card reader built in for camera picture transfer.","But memory cards are so inexpensive these days.","My 10 year old Dell that has 14 GB of memory left doesnt crap up as much as my Toshiba.","I had been reluctant to adapt to notebook PCs due to the small keyboards and most laptops/notebooks are not really either small nor light.I bought mine as if by love at first sight, beautifull siver, 1\" thick and 4.5 lbs in weight, it stood out on the shelf.The Averatec is fast enough so that you really won\u0027t miss ultra fast processing (wouldn\u0027t make sense to expect workstation or gamestation ultra speed in a notebook for the road) I would think.It\u0027s a problem of definition, for me a \"portable PC\" is just what Averatec packages in the 3270, the best performance you can get economically.With a 60/80 Gb HD, DVD burner, wireless card, SMALL and LIGHT frame, 2.5 hour battery, great screen, 512 Mb memory...I watch DVD\u0027s, browse, work with Photoshop, listen to music and get asked frequently \"what PC is that... for how much..?It does perfectly well all that is not \"extreme\", but then again, how much extreme do you need..?Makes me feel great.I dumped my Toshiba Satellite and wouldn\u0027t pay 2000 bucks for a replacement, I tell you.But got mine for $900.00 and got a $150 bucks rebate.Need to have the fastestes or most expensive..? Don\u0027t look here.Need a PORTABLE PC...?Get an Averatec ! I had been researching on ultramobile PCs for quite a while and even looked at the Asus Eee PC, which is cheap but has a terrible low-res low-quality screen (and weighs a hefty 2 lbs, the same as my Sharp PC-MM20 *real* laptop with more memory and a 40GB hard drive).","Both the MB Pro come with Express Card slots but the Inspiron comes with a 5-card memory reader.","If you want something portable, I\u0027d buy something cheaper and lighter (and probably faster with more memory).","I bought this laptop for home/school use and it is awesome! I up the memory to 1.5 gigs and this thing runs great!

fan came on rarely and made a pleasant sound when running- Toshiba power management and system management software: Touch and Launch, Acoustic Silencer, graphical WiFi utility- S-Video (TV Out) for connection to projectors and TVsCons:- TruBrite display exhibits lots of glare, though this is common on nearly all glossy LCD\u0027s- Lacks DVI output and Express Card- Display exhibits too much flex and seems fragile- Poor 3D performance due to integrated graphics and shared memory- Below Average Battery life- Slower 333MHz DDR memory rather than newer 533MHz DDR2 memory, though lower latency (CL 2.5) generally compensates for slower speed- Keyboard seems slightly cramped and is shifted to the right rather than centered; dedicated Windows key is inconveniently located in upper-right area of keyboard- Relatively low-resolution 1280 x 800 display (98 PPI), though TruBrite has good color \u0026 contrast I bought this machine a little over a month ago, it replaced my Powerbook G3 1.5 Ghz.","I have no complaints with the intel Core 2 Duo, its fast, just get some extra memory regardless of what Mac you get, I would avoid the MacMini until its a Core 2 Duo, but get it with 1 GB and.","so relatively happy at this point, I didn\u0027t get too annoyed by the fact that the thing came back with Swedish OS (I don\u0027t speak swedish, have never lived in sweden, I live in France and the laptop was repaired in the UK!) so I had to re-install my old OS with a dictionary at hand, download all missing updates, re-install every single piece of software etc. loads of work..until I later realised something quite devastating as i was inserting my XD-memory card into the 6in1 media card reader that I had grown to love: the card just slipped into the computer-not into a card reader but fell into the laptop completely! I had a closer look and realised that there was no media card reader anymore on the laptop.","Both lack the PC Card (PCMCIA) slot but can accommodate AirPort Extreme wireless network.Other than faster G4 processor, just about the only reasons to consider 12\" PowerBook are:- Larger memory capacity on the PowerBook (1.25 GB vs. 640 MB)- Larger hard disk (40 GB vs. 30 GB)- PowerBook can drive an external display (dual display) up to 2048-by-1536 via DVI port; iBook can only mirror up to 1024-by-768 via VGA port- SuperDrive (DVD burner) is optional on PowerBook; it is not available on iBook- Bluetooth is standard on PowerBook; it is optional (built-to-order) on iBook- Marginally faster GeForce FX 5200 graphics card on PowerBook (vs. Radeon 9200 on iBook)- PowerBook is slightly lighter (4.6 lbs vs. 4.9 lbs) and slightly smaller (10.9-by-8.6-by-1.18 inches vs. 11.2-by-9.1-by-1.35 inches)- You like the PowerBook\u0027s anodized aluminum allow chassis betterThere are sufficient reasons to get the iBook instead:- Costs almost 50% less- It is not dramatically slower- Longer battery life (up to 6 hours vs. 5 hours)- Polycarbonate plastic chassis is more scratch proof and offer better wireless network (AirPort Extreme) receptionHow is the iBook in itself? For a little over a grand, you get a beautifully designed notebook (similar to iPod) packed with features: combo CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive, optional 802.11g AirPort Extreme wireless network, beautiful LCD, sensible keyboard layout, snappy performance under included Mac OS X Panther 10.3 -- all in very portable form factor.","With the 1GB of RAM, I find that there never seems to be a lack of memory.","I view the task manager to see how much memory is being consumed and am pleasantly suprised by how low it is.","Overall - I love this machine and will use it for a long time Here\u0027s why I\u0027d rate this computer a 5 out of 5:First off, the specs aren\u0027t too shabby for less than 900 dollars, IE, Celeron-M 2.40 Ghz, 256 Megs of Ram, ATI Mobility Radeon 7000 (this thing gets 128 megs of shared video memory if you go to half a gig of Ram), 1024x768 at 15\u0026quot;, 40gig hard drive, DVD/CD-RW drive, Firewire, 2 USB ports, 5-One Touch buttons, Touchpad On/Off button (very handy if you are typing something lengthy and constantly have to rest your arms on the touchpad), VGA port, Serial Port, Parallel Port, PS/2 Port, built-in 56k Modem/10/100 LAN combo, Mic Port, Headphone Port, mute button, volume controls on the side of the machine, and an S-Video Port, all weighing just around 6.5 pounds and getting a LONG 4.5 hours from battery.","My computer was $1,100 for less everything!!goods about this product+ large harddrive 40GB+ large memory 512MB+ Sharp screen and full color+ easy to find icons such as iTunes and Internet+ light weightbads about this product- only a 12\" screen (should be at least 14\" for the price)- it is white, so it will get dirty and dusty quickly- you have to buy a mouse if you don\u0027t want to use the one on the computerA few things could have been made better on this product, but everything else is excellent! I have an issue with Sony Corp.","I might sit at the dining room table, on the couch, on the living room floor, in the office, or in my bedroom.I do recommend you add some memory to the iBook, which can add yourself.","At most, it might need a memory upgrade.","I have nothing else that uses a memory stick.","This is a good thing, as memory upgrades rely more on the CPU than the system maker.","I watched a 2.5 hour DVD movie on it last night and the battery was completely drained by then.In addition to the extra memory, bought myself a Silver corded optical VAIO mouse that goes very well with the silver/white exterior of the notebook.","Update yours immediately (could take 3-4 sessions of updating!)- Media Center works fine, but why use it when you can do the same thing with the Nero suite?

but read the cons bellow)- fast 100GB HDD and 1GB RAM- carbon fiber casing - light!- durable - I actually dropped it once from about a feet - no trace/problem whatsoever- looks stylish, but not too flashy- love the keyboardOk, so there are notebooks out there that match some of this:- You can get Asus barebone and stick _almost_ all you want in there, which is what I seriously considered, but if you match the features closely Asus becomes more expensive, while delivering LESS (and it\u0027s harder to get).- Dell\u0027s are just too expensive.- Toshiba, Sony, LG don\u0027t use AMD\u0027s processors (silly buggers) and while Pentium M is close in performance area and goes easier on the power/heat it\u0027s not 64 bit, and P4 is way worse in that respect than even non-mobile AMD 64.Now the disappointments:- I worked for a bit on an HP notebook and I have to say, its screen performed better in terms of color reproduction.","So really, this machine has 768MB of RAM when the virtual memory is depleted.","The video card is an adequate ATI 32 megs (unfortunately, this is shared memory, not dedicated to video alone) driving a very sharp 15\u0026quot; active matrix display.","However, be warned: if you\u0027re looking for a laptop with a huge amount of memory, a top-notch graphics card and an enormous hard drive, this is not the model for you.","Combined, these elements mean I have a machine that\u0027s far faster and more capable than all of my desktops and almost as capable as my home server (I\u0027m a systems architect, so I know servers).It\u0027s also in possession of some other features that make it a superior value: a wide-screen super bright LCD at 15.4\", a dedicated ATI graphics chip with 256Mb of memory, a dual-layer DVD burner, an SD/MMC/MS card reader, 4 2.0 USB ports, a Firewire port, and two killer radios.Killer radios? Sure.","96 Mb Memory, not too good for the XP-Twins, Dual Type 2 pcmcia Slots for Dual FastEther thats good for a Supertower, but Outstanding for a Laptop.","I was worried at first but Lenovo has carried the Thinkpad torch superbly into the production of the T60 model.PROS:-Build quality is second to none.-Integrates MS Office Applications easily into hardware.-Super long battery life and high performance options.-Great tactile keyboard and you can buy a keyboard in various languages and type fonts.-All the parts are easily user removable, user replaceable, and user serviceable!-Great customer support at Lenovo!-Unique features like waterproof keyboard, airbag, roll cage, fingerprint security, Thinkpad manager, etc...-SXGA and UXGA resolution screens!-Quiet dust proof fan.CONS:- No SD or Memory Card slots but you can easily buy a PC adapter card.- Runs hot on surfaces like beds and cushions and fan is not super quiet when laptop is hot.- Video Memory options are scant on the T60 models.","If you are into collecting videos of concerts, a DVD-R is a must.I\u0027d recommend upgrading to at least 768 MB of memory and the 80 GB hard drive.","So, even if you get another 512MB memory module for free, in order for you to add it, you will need to remove one of those pre-installed 256 MB modules.","I especially like the 1.7 ghz processor, the 80 gb hd, and the DVD burner.- Pen writes very well.- Screen resistant to scratches.- Good looking.- Well-designed keyboard; responsive and smooth, keys well laid out.- Good screen resolution.- Expandable memory (I added another 512 mb to make a full gb: helps a lot!).- Customizable power settings.","Check it out at http://elivecd.org - you can try it out without installing first, to see how good it is.I was looking for a rather long time for a laptop like this, and now I\u0027m very happy after a month of using it.What I would change: I would put the SD card reader instead of memory stick one, and perhaps put one 1 gb stick of RAM instead of two 512 mb - for easier upgrade.Very recommended if you need a complete but not over-the-top mobile solution.","no need for the battery in my case.installed a gig of memory for $67 under the base, and it flies.using nod 32 anti-virus.","With the similar price, the Sony one has more features, eg. two cameras while OQO doesn\u0027t have one, the Sony one has better resolution, 1024x600 while the OQO only 800x400, the Sony one has a keyboard more closed to standard keyboard, Sony one has memory stick slot.","I also up graded the memory and replaced the dvd drive.","It comes with 512MB of PC2-4200 DDR2 memory which is standard for a budget oriented system but won\u0027t run as smoothly as one with a full gigabyte.Storage is also fairly average for a budget notebook system.","Expect to spend another $80-$100 to buy 512MB memory to get a reasonable performance (I noticed the hard disk spins all the time if multiple apps run at the same time).4.","Excellent purchase - I was looking for a lightweight computer with good battery life, a large memory and optical drive.","nVidia\u0027s integrated video memory is one of the drawbacks of this system.","There are internet several discussion forums which deal with this issue.2) The performance of the computer is not sufficient, my computer has a Dual-Core processor and 4 Gb Ram and 256 SSD HD memory.3) The display cracked suddenly two months ago.","Holding it over your shoulder will give you back pains.There is a slot for a memory stick.","Could have gone up to 3 gigs, but what would I be doing with all that memory?

Oh, the DVD player on my system works great and I\u0027ve played it through my TV with no complaints!Now the problem is the memory that was sent to me.","Registers are small, extremely fast memory for a processor.","I decided that I HAD to give it a try and so I did!My Apple Powerbook G4 15\" came last week with an additional 512MB ram (1GB memory total) and I have to say, I\u0027m pretty satisfied with it.","I have continuously used it for 8 hours in a flight and still had juice for later.Of course in the past 3 years the hd capacity, the memory and the cpu speed have all improved.","It needs airflow at high power, and some of the airflow comes from the bottom (also on the left side).*** Off my soap box ***PROS:-Knock out gorgeous design-Beautiful, breathtaking screen (blows my customers away)-Fast (running many of the standard games, Photoshop, etc., with no problems and high quality)-Good sound-Big hard drive-Adequate memory-Overall just a very nice, professional, beautiful laptop for an excellent price ($1250 at CCity)CONS:-Mediocre software (by the way, exact same as on the Sony quoted by another reviewer)-Need more memory (cheap online, less than $70 for 512M at NewEgg)-Um...hmmm...no other complaints!Buy it; you will love it.Best to all,Mike Bought this notebook and 2 2GB Kingston RAM memories, installed the RAM perfectly and the computer runs incredibly fast, Best Laptop EVER! what can i say... its a Mac!

this time they tried to replace the hard drives AND the system memory.","Sony is most notable for their S and SZ series notebooks (13.3\" Screen), or their ultraportable T and TX series, so the FS series kind of has a lack of flare in comparison.PROS:-VERY CRISP screen with 1280x800 native resolution-Great number of ports on connections, including memory card reader-Very portable-Great pricing-Pentium M-Dual Layer DVD Burner-Battery Life is better than Toshiba\u0027s (I got 2.13hours... manufacturer claims 3 hours, but I had it with max brightness and Wi-Fi, so that\u0027s pretty good... 25% more battery)-100GB Hard DriveCONS:-Outdated processor, as well as not even top of the line-Only 512MB of RAM, and not even the fastest (only 533MHz... they make 667MHz)-Graphics Media Accelerator - uncommon in Sony notebooks, but not good for anything more than causal use nonetheless - GMA\u0027s use shared memory for its virtual memory, so you could get as low was 384MB of RAM remaining if the GMA kicks in.-Useless Sony programs -

more than enough for using the internet, watching movies, listening to and storing plenty of music, word processing, and other common tasks.-Improved power adapter: On my old iBook, the adapter had warped fairly easily and I had to replace it, but the magnetic version on the MacBook seems very sturdy.-Remote control: Very simple, light remote control that can easily contol music, dvds, and

your video memory in half.","I experienced a few pauses I attribute to the virtual memory system kicking in when I used it with 4GB, but not one since I upgraded the memory to 8GB.","If you\u0027re going to be doing alot of memory draining work, I suggest ordering an extra gig of ram (it comes with 1 gig,with 2 gig max).","If you use the laptop for serious work I recommend increasing the memory

Viking 512MB chip at a considerable discount to the comparable part from Apple Store).","I upgraded the memory to 4GB, but, due to the hardware limitation of the laptop, the amount of memory recognized is less than 3GB.But, again, considering that this laptop sells at half the price of other laptops, it\u0027s a very good price, despite my irritations with it.EDIT: After one and half years, the wireless connection failed for the second time.","My first one had a 30 gigabyte hard drive with 256 megabytes of ram and had upgradable memory, of which I took full advantage.","I did a quick online search and discovered that many folks had experienced the same thing... apparently, there had been some problems with the solder joints for memory on the video card failing.","I increased the memory from 1gig to 2gigs and it has helped it to run faster but has not done anything for the freeze issues.","Vista just hogs too much memory.","I suggest increasing memory to at leat a gig. of

designed/built \"budget\" notebook.","This is fine for card games but don\u0027t get your hopes too high.At this price range you can get a 14\" laptop with a superior graphics system, faster CPU, and faster memory (this computer is equipped with slower SDRAM not the twice as fast Double Data Rate SDRAM that is standard on 90% of the notebooks sold today).","We had to buy numerous upgrades for it to even run World of Warcraft on top of my pictures (they take up a lot of memory).BOTTOM LINE: If you\u0027re looking for a low-key laptop and you don\u0027t need much memory, this is a nice little piece of hardware.","For some reason, the two memory sticks didn\u0027t work well together and it caused my computer to lock up.","I wish its memory can extend to 2GB or more so I can run Vista one day, but 1 GB so far is OK for XP and my other applications (Office 2007, for example).LCD is so clear and the image quality is superb.","it\u0027s a great device althoug it might require more ram memory to speed up windows vista, but i\u0027m happy with it it s a great fast laptop,however i wish that anti virus and microsoft office were included without paying more.","All the compartments underneath, such as the battery and memory covers, seem to fit well and are easily removed.The main thing to watch for on the T22 is pressure marks on the TFT screen, which will leave white or lightened spots on darker backgrounds.","The computer recognized the new RAM memory right away.CD/DVDI have been able to read copied DVDs in this driver which I haven\u0027t been able to play elsewhere (I\u0027m sorry, it was a present, but say NO to piracy).I have only burned data disks so far, but with TOAST 6.0 Software (not included out of the box) it was a breeze and the burn rate was

goodness this is standard now.","This time, I\u0027ll be very careful to choose one with a REAL video chipset (a full Radeon 9700 or 9800) with dedicated video memory instead of this \"shared ram\" gimmick.","When you\u0027re running Windows XP, 512 is really the bare minimum for decent performance, so dropping down to 384 will put you into using virtual memory pretty quickly.","Not the fastest for gaming, not the most memory for music/movies storage, but those features can easily be upgraded.","I have dictated long detailed sets of field notes while my memory was fresh when I was driving.","The only complaint that I would have is there needs to be documentation on how to replace the memory that is not in the expansion slot.","The 2195 has better graphics, USB2.0 ports for quicker access to files on digital cameras and other devices, fire wire to load video from digital video cameras, more memory for video editing and playing games and an integrated 802.11g wireless network card.This laptop is bulky and heavy.","It has two memory slots in total, with a maximum memory expansion only 1 GB (2 x 512 MB)****However, it is not true.","I bumped up the memory to 2GB just to give Windows room; it may be possible to run with just 1GB, but I did not mind spending the extra $140 for the memory.Plus points: powerful processor, big big screen, nice enough keyboard, quiet fans, nice speakers, bluetooth integration, price is competitive with other PCs.Negative points: DVD drive died and replaced under warranty in the first week, big screen means more weight, and hot machine (don\u0027t put it on your lap unless you are sitting inside an igloo).Intangible point: a Microsoft consultant said to me: \"Your laptop is really cool; who makes that?\" Ha.","Plus, if you load your CDs on your computer, they can eat up a lot of memory, even as MP3s (my 5,000 songs take up about 25 GB).Also, there is a lot to be said for getting the Airport Exteme card (although you can buy a third-party base station for less).","It works great, though the fan is loud and comes on a lot, otherwise it\u0027s excellent...small, slim, light weight and enough RAM and memory for everything I need.","It has a lot of memory, Vista is easy to use, and movies look great on the screen.","The seller made me a very good deal on the price and included several expensive extras in the purchase at no extra charge (including a memory upgrade from the standard 512MB to 1GB).I\u0027ve used this laptop as a wireless desktop replacement (no longer have a desktop) and have traveled with it on occasion.","I did upgrade the memory and added a dvd-burner and that\u0027s it.It does get warm, which all laptops do, mine has never shut off or had problems.","I might want to upgrade the memory to 1 GB some day, but in everything I did, the standard memory worked just fine and that involved many very large JPG files from my 6.3 MP camera.","I got this notebook for the configuration, the processor, memory and XP OS.","I saved $200 with the Apple Education discount so if anyone is planning to buy one soon in the near future, remember to take advantage of the discount (even if you\u0027re not currently enrolled in school; just pick any school - a school your children go to or a school that you went to and you\u0027ll still get the discount)! It cost me $2,050 total including the 1GB memory upgrade and tax altogether when it should\u0027ve cost me $2250-$2300.","The 680 has a DVD drive and a slot that accepts Memory Stick (Sony Cybershot Digital Camera) photo cards for the easiest photo uploads ever.","I checked Intel\u0027s website to read up on the GMA 950 and wasn\u0027t enlightened much, but it did seem like the GMA 950 could increase the memory if resources were available.","siple, reliable, heavy device with big sharp screen....need to upgrade the paltry 128 megs of memory but it runs xp just fine as is... use it for reports at work and home but it has \u0026quot;play potential\u0026quot; with more memory..Just ordered a linksys wireless access point for my desk top and a card for the laptop so I can cruise the net while lying in bed with my spouse while she watches her murder mysteries... that should be a gas if I get it working and apparrently some folks find it a no-brainer while others run into frustrations.","The HP technician in India asked me to take the memory cards and the hard drive out, reinstalled them.","(I read so many other reviews suggesting that Vista was too taxing on the processor and 1 GB of memory).","It pays to buy the cheaper model with 512mb of memory, buy a new gigabyte card or two, and upgrade manually.","First off you get the 64 bit processor..an ATI graphics system...dvd/dvr and plenty of memory and hd space.","It came with a 10 GB hard drive, the operating system took up most of that space.I also purchased extra memory from the merchant (MacMall) which was installed at time of purchase.I had never before been disappointed in a Mac - it was my 4th mac purchase.Because it was such a dog, I never used it much and finally well after warranty it broke.","At 850 Mhz you may think slow, but I will tell you that I find it to be just as fast as my new Sony PCG-752, 2.0 mhz! The portability makes it easy to transport, the memory stick makes it easy to upload my photos from my Sony-P9 camera and also share files with other, non-Sony PCs by us an optional USB memory stick reader.","System memory is provided by a very fast 512 megs of DDRAM.","But get a new card with Rev A if you can, it\u0027s even better.ADDENDA (another)At the THREE year point this beauty is still going strong with additional upgrades such as 4GB of core memory now.","This also means that if I push the system hard enough even 8GB of memory isn\u0027t enough the virtual memory system will use the much faster solid state drive.","Both drives are 5400rpm.Secondly, this machine is mis-marked everywhere as having \"512mb of Dedicated Video Memory\".","Upgrade of its RAM memory to 1GB would be a wise idea.","When I log into WinXP, the notebook comes with bad sound(the sound justlikes every computer running out memory).","The memory, processors, wide screen and capabilities far exceed what I had on my desktop.","The video graphics is good because ATI is the best, but it uses shared memory architecture (main memory - video memory \u003d available memory), which is not very fast compared to embedded memory architecture.","It\u0027s got a crisp, clean, bright display and lots of memory (fast!).","The perfect all around system.Memory - This Mac is a powerhouse and 1 GB of memory (thats included) will get you started nicely.","Some recurring issues in forums are: overheating issues, dead pixel (one) on the LCD (which some tech guy at a store told me is common on LCD screens, anyhow), smaller keyboard size (true enough, but it\u0027s not bad at all), sound system not being outstanding (come on, people, get a desktop for such extensive audio work!), and the Windows XP Home Edition that\u0027s pre-loaded (yes, really, DO upgrade to the Pro Edition, as it\u0027s less \"buggy\").BUT, what notebook is perfect? What other notebook has this much power, speed, battery power-saving capabilities (Centrino, baby), DVD-RW/CD-RW, Widescreen LCD screen display (you have to SEE to believe..it\u0027s SO beautifully bright that you can\u0027t help but be mesmerized and think \"purty\"!), 80GB storage capacity, firewire port, 4 USB ports, built-in wireless WiFi connectivity (get the Linksys Wireless router WRT54G for faster, more reliable speed), SD memory storage, and at 6 lbs., what else could you want? Think about it: what notebook doesn\u0027t have problems? They all do or will at some point.","I think that some users do not know what to expect from the items they buy and they expect miracles.My machine came with a memory stick of 512Mb, so I just bought another 1Mb to make it faster, but it was running perfect on 512Mb.","Now I am using this in a \"Windows Classic\" mode to conserve memory and to speed up applications.I believe that the GPU prevents the CPU from accessing any memory while it is working (and not just the shared memory alone).","It is very powerful and can be quite a beast with a set of good speakers, memory upgrade, and an extra battery.","Replace the 512K memory with 1Gig memory stick.","There aren\u0027t parallel, serial, or PCMCIA card ports - Sony isn\u0027t alone in dropping them as obsolete - but Sony made a big mistake in not including a HDMI output as they do on the FZ180 and up, and replacing Bluetooth with Sony-approved memory card slots makes no sense.","It works great with 64-bit Linux distributions - as of 2006, even suspend and hibernate works out-of-the-box.Pros:* 64-bit* Dual-layer DVD burner *with* Lightscribe* Flexible memory configuration.","Memory: 768MB DDR SDRAM3.","I got a free memory/hard drive upgrade with my ThinkPad so I\u0027ve been merrily cramming it with resource-hog games and they play loads better than I\u0027d expected.","I couldn\u0027t go for normal laptop since I\u0027m working on memory monsters applications such as AutoCAD, 3D Max and Photoshop, and they really need a real powerful PC.I ordered this piece of art from Amazon my first and best online shopping place.","The memory card adapter \u0026 memory stick slot makes it complete multimedia support system.The only thing I can find missing in this laptop is the inbuilt camera support.","There is a PCMCIA Type II slot on the left side and a Memory Stick slot right next to it.","It has many great features on it, from the wireless connection, speed, memory to the DVD burner.","The spacious 30GB of room, excellent video and 256 MB of DDR Memory should be enough for day-to-day duties and for students and office workers on the go.","Burning a DVD requires a lot of memory and can take a while - this way you can use other applications while burning a DVD (on my old PC, if I was burning a CD, I couldn\u0027t use anything else).","The Dell is cheaper and it has more memory.\"","That\u0027s because of the graphic card and 2GB memory.","I wanted a laptop that was relatively compact, had a one gigahertz AMD processor, at least 256 megabytes of memory, and a DVD/CD-RW combination drive.","That\u0027s the only one that will enable you to play games under vista.Perhaps the only suggestion I would make to anyone thinking about buying this fantastic machine, is purchase an extra 512 - 1GB of memory, make sure it\u0027s PC2100 DDR SDRAM SODIMM, and partition your hard drive, first off.","They always made great machines based on AMD processors, and this seems to be no exception.The 64-bit Athlon64 cpu delivers roughly the same power as a 3.2 Ghz P4, and not only that, it can run today\u0027s 32-bit applications as well as tomorrow\u0027s Windows for AMD64 (currently in beta) and today\u0027s 64-bit SUSE Linux 9.1 (which includes a fully ported 64 bit kernel).The video chipset is a \"real\" one, using dedicated video memory instead of \"shared ram\".The screen seems lovely for DVD playback, and the HD space is enough even for splitting in two and installing XP + Linux in a dual-boot configuration.Good-bye P4 notebooks...","Poor/sluggish performance even after upgrading memory to 2GB.Takes quite a bit of time to boot up/down.Does not respond well to automatic Windows updatesDO NOT TRY TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS VISTA HOME PREMIUM!! I tried and the computer is completely unusable! Common/expected functionality non-existant! HP Support not available after upgrade! positives:- incredible screennegatives:- horrible battery life (due to incredible screen)- often not compatible with iTunes (call SONY if you don\u0027t believe me).","DVD viewing is a wondrous experience even at full screen; who needs a big screen TV? And while I will probably never mate my 1905-S301 with an external monitor, it\u0027s nice to have the ATI Radeon video card with 16MB of DDR video memory at my disposal.","Invest in external drives, sony memory stick, etc, etcexpensive product overall.-------The tricky part with this computer is that it\u0027 s so small, that mechanical parts are phone to fail quickly.Mine, the fan broke in just 1.5 years of owning.Then the mouse got stuck on lower- right corner and never worked again.","It is SLOW SLOW SLOW even though it has 2 GB of memory and not many applications installed.","It doesn\u0027t take a rocket scientist (although I used to be one) to figure out that this notebook was sold with insufficient memory (512K).","sony has done a good job with is this relatively low-cost powerfull notebook.i will not bore you with the pros about this machine since you can find the good things all over but be aware that there are couple of things that sony could improve to make this laptop even better; first is that the user should have the freedom to upgrade the os at any time, i could not upgrade my vaio to winxp pro; second sony should have system boards that support pc133 sdram and ddr-sdram, the fx series only support pc100 dsram so you can\u0027t fully experience the power of the athlon with a slow memory bandwidth of a pc100 memory; third the fx series should be equipped with newer video cards, the ati rage is quite old and it only has 8mb sdram at 2x agp, i would strongly recommend at minimum a relatively new video card with 16mb ddr-sdram at 4x agp because the fx/fxa series are supposed to be powerfull machines; fourth, don\u0027t expect the battery to last you long since powerfull computers demand a lot of power and because amd cpu\u0027s eat up a lot of energy even their newest .18 micron cpu\u0027s.so these are just minor setbacks on sony fxa\u0027s, but if you compare these with other companies like hp, compaq, etc, you will find out that these flaws are almost nothing.","That desktop has \u0026quot;integrated Intel graphics\u0026quot; and the iBook has 32mb of dedicated graphics memory, so maybe that has something to do with it, but the desktop also has 512mb memory, while the iBook has 256mb.","Both computers became very sick (memory slot problem, dvd-rom problem, lcd problem, etc) just after the warranty expired.","Pros: Memory door gives you access to the CPU, too (good construction design).","ladies and gentleman...this system will take ur world by storm...nuthing in the market comes anywhere close to what this system offers...100 gb hard drive, double layer dvd burner, surround speakers, 15 inch screen, 1 gb ram - this beauty is out of this world!!i use it for university...and its absolutely great...it comes with onenote, which is great to take notes with...and the computer is super fast...for those concerned with battery life - rest assured, ive used this baby for 4 hours flat on batteries and thats well above industry standards!!the wireless connects with ease...i havent tried the memory card readers but it seems pretty good....downside is that it dusnt support sony memory stick/pro/duo or even compact flash...but thats not a big issue to me cuz i can connect my cam via usb anywayall this for such a low price is awesome...this is the talk of my school...not one other person has beat my purchase interms of value for the buck....the features and the price have virtually no correlation whatsoever...take this baby home while it lasts!!!also, my pc dint get heated up or anything...so its not an issue...also, regarding the screen glare, its a trubrite screen, so the glare is normal...but otherwise the resolution on this screen is comparable with sony\u0027s vaio and the qosmio and apple screens...its beautiful...the black border around the screen makes images bright and crisptrust me...this is one purchase u will NOT regret!!

anything but windows, well you\u0027ll have a poor performance.Also very important, the hard drive that is included with the computer is a 4200rpm HD which is QUITE slow for any standard.When the OS is paging or accessing the HD this speed is critical.I don\u0027t know about your computer but mine had 512mb of memory, and let\u0027s say the full 2Gb could really boost performance.I am a software

I also added more memory (512 should be your minimum, but adding a 1 gig module is advised).","So with a gig of memory, half the brains are already accounted for.","I wouldn\u0027t buy a laptop from anybody else, have always had a great experience with them.Personally I prefer a Toshiba Tecra S1, it has 32MB of dedicated video memory on a Radeon ATI card whereas this one has shared video memeory, and tons of different connections and expandability options.But still way better than some crappy HP or Compaq or Sony, my IT friends all report that those have the most repairs by far.Hint: buy extra memory from Dell, it\u0027s a snap to install yourself and will save you $$$.","Add to that a slower 4200 RPM hard drive where the virtual memory is stored, and you can bog down pretty quickly.BUT, take heart, because this machine uses a fairly inexpensive form of DDR 2700 RAM (200 pin, 2.5 latency, unbuffered, unregistered).","Price did not include any \u0027extra\u0027 software other than that installed on base model.Mine: PIII at 1.2 Ghz, \u0027M\u0027 cpu that offers step down to 800 mhz when on batteries, 30 gig hdd, 512 megs memory, legacy ports,1 usb is 1.1, 2 PCMIA slots, 56k modem, 10/100 ethernet, 16 meg ATI Radeon Mobility AGP video card, AC power adapter, \u0027new\u0027 leather carrying case, floppy drive and cable, Combo DVD Rom/ CD +/-RW.","After researching the notebook computer market, I\u0027ve come to an conclusion that every brand has its own target user group and should not be compared simply by price, CPU speed, memory size, etc.Don\u0027t get me wrong.","It is faster, has more memory, a bigger hard drive, and bluetooth technology built-in.","Over time I was held back by: 1) the sound never worked without stuttering, 2) even with a memory upgrade, it was very slow running XP SP2, and 3) the screen was hard to read in a brightly lit room.","It is supposed to be expandable to 2 gig mem but these memory modules are some abnormal parts that are not easy to locate a replacement for.","Memory parity erors.","I tried to upgrade to 4GB of Crucial memory but the following happened: 1).","Oddly all the Windows laptops I found for $1000 were HUGE, ugly, and had very little memory.","Standard office applications and Internet browsing work well IMO, although I did add an extra memory module just to be safe.","A 800mhz system front bus speed,60g HD, 512 MB memory,p4 hyper-threading and the numerous USB, s-video, etc... outputs makes this little man a portable media center.","the sony laptop has no infared port, no SD, SC, CM or other flash memory card slots.","When you\u0027ve done that, click the Apple on the toolbar and click \"about this Mac\" and your new memory should show up.I then downloaded Aspyr\u0027s game agent to find out what games my system can play.","I\u0027ve recently upgraded the memory \u0026 now there\u0027s nothing it can\u0027t do well.I heartily recommend this wonderful device.","That solved 75% of the slowness problem--a really irksome feature of the McAfee effort to protect you from every possible threat, even to provide us with parent controls for internet use! I also removed several other \"free\" programs from memory [pre-installed], including the VISTA upgrade to Microsoft Office.","The screen is clear and bright, the case it attractive, and the sound is pretty good.I recommend that you order the SODIMM memory upgrade at the same time you order this computer.","Vista is I suppose a fast OS if you have dual core CPUs or better, and 2GB of memory of more, but these cheap machines will have neither.","I am a trackpoint user and no touchpad has ever impressed me like this one.The power of AMD Turion 64, with 2GB of ram just eliminated my ritual of having to buy additional memory right after buying a notebook.","Also the video card is dedicated memory, not sharred.","Expect about 2 hours on normal usage.Since then I have increased the operating speed by adding another Gig of memory (about $80.00) and replacing the hard drive with a larger faster 180 gig Sata 7200 rpm drive (about $120.00) and using the original drive in the second drive bay for video\u0027s and data.","Pros:1- High performance (Video/Divx(coding/decoding)/Game)2- High quality screen (Bright, good contrast, not supporting many resolutions though, maybe because it has a wide aspect ratio)3- Good specification (Good size RAM, SATA hard drive)4- Good features (memory card reader)5- My favorite (Express media Player, no need to boot up the OS to watch a DVD, I love it)6- Reliable (to my experience in these past five weeks)7- Good Audio (Not the best speakers and power output, but it does produce clear sounds not usually expected from laptops in this price range)8- Good wireless reception(picks up neighboring networks well!, but I have my own)9- Good size and design, and not heavy in comparison to other laptops that I have had.Personally, I very much recommend this laptop (specialy to students and HomeOffice owners).","The keyboard can be a little tough to read in dim lighting due to the black on silver lettering, but it isn\u0027t that big a deal to me.Overall, I would say the TX750 delivers pretty good bang for the buck, but power users may prefer one of the newer releases for the added memory and battery performance.","If you are into collecting videos of concerts, a DVD-R is a must.I\u0027d recommend upgrading to at least 768 MB of memory and the 80 GB hard drive.","Perhaps the best feature of the Toshiba Notebook is the ability to expand the memory to 4GB which may well be in this notebooks future.","I\u0027ll probably add an external Firewire 800 drive for the video work I want to do.- processor speed gets a minor upgrade to 2.4 gHz (from 2.33, or to 2.2 from 2.16 for the lower-end 15\" model - but this is the new Santa Rosa processor - with a faster bus speed of 800 mHz (although the memory speed remains at a max of 667 mHz).For $500 less, the lower-end 15\" model has 128 MB of video ram (instead of 256), a 2.2 gHz Santa Rosa processor (.2 slower) and a 120 GB hard drive.","This baby is fully-loaded (512MB DDR2 Memory, 80GB HD, DVD SuperMulti (+/- R double layer) Drive, Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG (802.11a/b/g), almost similar to the one you find in higher-end models.","If you want to upgrade, you will need to discard one or both of the original memory banks.","The drive\u0027s speed is still marketed as 8x.Memory - The Powerbook continues to come standard, with 512 MB of memory, but new system architecture now makes use of DDR2 memory.","My husband upgraded us to Vista and I\u0027m sad to say that it lost it\u0027s DVR and TV capability, and the memory card slot no longer works.","Probably the most reliable of all the Thinkpads, well at least in recent memory.","Also its neat that it comes with a bult in card reader for up to seven different kinds of memory cards so no adapters are ever needed for this one, The keyboard has a excellent feel to it and the keys are well spaced and its nice having a seperate keypad.","$749.99 with rebate.It fairly fast despite only 256 Meg RAM.Display is crisp and bright.I\u0027ve successfully installed Microsoft Office and Paintshop Pro,copied a music CD, watched a moovie, transferred files from a Sony Memory Stick to a USB drive, listened to mp3 and ogg vorbis files, and surfed via the wireless connection.I\u0027m going to recommend buying several more of these to a little nonprofit board I belong to.What\u0027s not to love? I\u0027ve been trying to find other reviews on this product but have found few so I thought I\u0027d write something.","Amazon does not have this specific memory available.Applications -Apple includes iLife \u002706, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband.","I have not upgraded the memory yet, but will soon, so cannot comment on the purported performance gains that many say come with this, but I am looking foward to an effortless swap over due to the new and improved access to both the memory and the HD, which upon a cursory glance looks to be much improved.Great package.","You can only have a total memory of 256mb, 512mb, 1GB or 2GB.","Max out the memory and get Apple Care.","You may want to consider buying the 12-cell battery from Toshiba to extend battery life--I will.While the 6-in-1 memory card reader is great, compatible with Secure Digital (SD), Memory Stick, Memory Stick Pro, SmartMedia, MMC, and XD Picture Card, it would have been nice to have a slot for CF cards as well (yes, some of us still use them).When the CD-ROM is accessing information, it can vibrate a bit; operationally not a problem, just a bit annoying.Of course, I can do without all the preloaded software (as I\u0027m sure most of us can), but it is easily removed.","Its fast and has tons of memory.","The only thing bothered me is I had to buy two extra memory card (1 GB each) to run the computer properly.","I believe both Leopard and Vista machines require at least 2GB (even though they are commonly sold in 1GB configurations) and I use my machine extensively for work - no games or toys! I purchased Kingston memory and it has worked flawlessly.","I have since gone back to a desktop for business use, and the Toshy has been relegated to home/travel duty.I just upgraded the memory to 1G, and installed GoToMyPc.","It was great then but was I recently replaced it with a HP G7-1075 HP.***HP G7-1075DX Pavilion Laptop / AMD Phenom II Processor / 17.3\" LED HD Display / 4GB DDR3 Memory / 500GB Hard Drive / Multiformat DVDRW/CD-RW drive / Windows 7 Home Premium Edition operating system - Pewter I\u0027ve had this notebook computer for just under 2 years and in that time it has been nothing but problems.","The memory on this computer is enormous and the speed of the computer is great too.","However, you may consider adding even more memory at some point.","I must say that the memory management in Mac OS X Tiger is excellent!

I jacked the ram up to 1024 and run my vid card memory @ 128MB for better balance.The 4 stars is mainly for the weight and size of this beast.","Pros:- the best 15.4\" screen I\u0027ve seen on a laptop, much brighter than the Toshiba M45 (though colors are slightly washed out)- thin and relatively light considering the specs- exceptional design, runs cool, very quiet- easy to upgrade hard drive, RAM, or battery- Sony\u0027s are known to be very reliable but if they do break down you might get the runaround from SonyCons:- lots of useless software pre-loaded that makes the system much slower than it should be- difficult to perform a clean install (instructions are vague on Sony\u0027s site) but the system is MUCH faster if you do- connectivity ports are on the sides rather than along the back of the laptop which can get messy- LCD emits slight humming noise when brightness is set at less than full (this is a known issue)- shared video memory (perfectly fine for typical tasks, not okay for games)- slow 4200rpm hard drive (though easy to upgrade to 7200rpm)- Sony\u0027s support isn\u0027t the best: long hold times, weak web supportConclusion:definitely check out the Fujitsu N3510 and Toshiba\u0027s M45, which both have similar glossy displays, though I think you\u0027ll find the Sony to be the leader of the pack.","I have always been a fan of Lance Armstrong, and it influenced my decision to buy this notebook.Even though this notebook has a graphic cards that shares the memory with the system, the performance of Radeon XPress 200 is adequate for the many 3D graphics.","I\u0027ll break my review into three sections; General Comments, Pros and Cons.General Comments:- Processor: AMD Turion 64 Processor TL64- Memory: 2GB- Screen Size: 15.4\"- Hard Drive 200GB- OS: Vista Premium- Video: Nvidia GeForce Go 7400Pros:- QuickPlay: Lets you play DVD\u0027s, Videos \u0026 Music without having to have the computer booted.- QuickPlay Buttons: Above the keyboard there are touch sensitive buttons for stopping, playing, pausing and volume levels while using QuickPlay.- QuickPlay Remote: Comes with a mini remote that stores in the ExpressCard port for use with QuickPlay.- USB Ports: It\u0027s got three USB ports which is good for most needs.- DVD+RW DL LightScribe Burner (What else could you ask for?)- Integrated WebCam/Microphone (Works good with Yahoo \u0026 MSN)Cons:- Preinstalled software, demos and junk!!! OMG, I was watching something on CNET and they were saying that new computers are overloaded with preinstalled software, but this is ridicules.","The good thing about this product is it has a larger harddrive and memory than my HP.","Finally, a level 2 technician concluded that the computer was sold with too little memory to run Windows Vista, properly.","I bought it from Best Buy which I highly recomend to anyone really interested, because if you go when there\u0027s a sale, you can get a bundled pack so you can get printers/scanners and additonal software for a pretty good price.Pros:- decent amount of memory- pretty stable- thin \u0026 light ( i have to say it looks sexy :) )- the speakers are really good for built in\u0027sCons:- the battery life is really below averageSo if you just want a notebook for school/ home this is a pretty good investment.","As a college student, this computer has proved to be fast and reliable, though the main two reasons why I didn\u0027t give it a 5/5 is because:a)It is pretty bulky by today\u0027s standardsb)No S-Video port (a must on most of today\u0027s computers, but it does have a VGA port so you can still manage to connect it to other audio/video devices).The speakers that the computer include are not that great, but I already had Z-680\u0027s so it wasn\u0027t a big deal.The graphics on this computer are pretty good, and it has a decent amount of memory.","If you need to be productive...add $ for the necessary memory to allow it to run serious applications.If you have the nerve and the patience, Compaq does provide drivers and patches for Win2000 for this model.","I returned it to the store to add more memory.","The Athlon chip combined with the 256 MB of memory makes for a speedy response time.","All three memory providers ended up telling me that they would not support a 256 memory module for this model.","There are so many wonderful features of this laptop - the screen, the memory, the video card, the dual-core processor, the volume control on the keyboard (you will never be able to be without it again) - but unfortunately HP decided to throw in some cheap components too.","Also, I upgraded memory to 512MB that makes me satisfied with its speed when I am running many programs in the same time.","I added a 512 mb memory stick to the pre-installed 256 mb the day after I got the laptop.","My MacBook is the low end model, with memory upgraded to 1 GB (This is an upgrade I stronly recommended) .","Some other sellers of this model also quote the dedicated memory aspect while other sellers still refer to shared video ram but this really is 32 MB dedicated video memoryOne thing I notice is that, at 2.4 GHz, it\u0027s not really that fast.","Right out of the gate the thing sucked with only 1 gig. of memory.","3) 4 USB 2.0 ports is never too many 4) Nice overall design and looks 5) Sound from Harmon/Kardon speakers is excellent and rich 6) Built-in WiFi reception is exceptional and very convenient 7) Easy to change/upgrade memory and hard drive with simple access doors(great design) 8) Scrolling feature on trackpad works very well 9) I don\u0027t use my desktop anymore.Cons: 1) Silver laptop finish scratches off easily 2) No Serial port 3) Screen can be brighter, more vivid and have better control 4) Requires 120w.","The reason I didn\u0027t just get the 2715 instead was that is costs...more! There\u0027s no reason for this when the difference between a 20gb and 30gb laptop drive is only $30-40! Video memory price is only around $20 more! For the difference in price I could buy a 2nd 30gb drive and more video memory if I needed it!2.","And the little handheld remote...how clever is that?! Very!This system comes with tons of memory, 2GB!! Probably because it has so many games and such on it already...it goes really fast while using it, which is what I like (until I start congesting it with software applications, that is!!).","It even works well with memory hogs such as Adobe software packages (ie.","I would recommend getting aftermarket memory stick (1GB costs around under $90).","I am using this computer to run memory hungry programs (eg Adobe Lightroom), and it does seem to run quite well.","If you spend 6 days a week on the road, or need a computer on those long cross-country flights, this is not the machine for you (Heavy, battery life can be a problem).However, if you are like me, and typically just move large files and computing power from point A to point B and back again and don\u0027t want to press out a new DVD or FTP every day to move information from one computer to another, this is the machine for you.You can\u0027t find a cheaper laptop with this much memory, processing speed and hard drive space (thanks to savings from the desktop processor).","Works better than any windows based Laptop I have had, and it has enough memory to run Windows Boot Camp too! Great, light, thin ... really really cool! Problem: Uses non-standard memory.","However, Microsoft\u0027s clunky memory hog Vista really drags the operating speed down, and I\u0027m going to have to upgrade the RAM to get it running the way I want it to run.","Pros: looks great, very light (even with battery inserted), memory stick slot, convenient if you have a sony camera or mp3 playerCons: doesnt come with backup windows cds.","Before ordering this one, I personally did not like the appearance of non-widescreen computers but this computer changed my view.256MB RAM is a bit less and with shared video memory, XP crawls on this.","(this is for those individuals who thought they couldn\u0027t get that option with apple notebooks) and you should upgrade the memory from 256 to 512 at least.","The specs I saw from gateway stated that it does not support dual channel memory access.","Try finding a PC laptop with built in FireWire, Ethernet, Modem, and wireless networking with the same kind of hard drive and memory capabilities and I assure you, you\u0027ll be paying more.","I\u0027ve upgrade the ram memory to it\u0027s maximum (4 gb) and add a faster HDD, a WD Scorpion black 500 GB 7200 rpm.","I could use less memory for my video card, but the result of maxing out the memory is faster rendering on a very nice bright 15\" LCD screen.","Never had any problems, except for one:I recently installed windows vista ultimate on this machine, (after of course installing a 512MB memory stick).","It says it has 128MB of virtual memory, but what you don\u0027t know is that it is using that memory from your RAM.","I bought a used T42 4 years ago, maximized the memory and upsized the HD.","XP home is the operating system and works reliably, but extra memory is needed because the video takes 40MB from the total memory.","I am not into much gaming and all, so the 4X AGP does not make much difference to me.A couple of things Sony could have improved upon was to put a 333 MHz memory instead of a 266 MHz one and provide a more versatile card reader (the card reader slot supports only Memory Stick Media.","It also feels solid enough, and battery life is good - it can play a dvd at full brightness for about 1.6 hours.The problem, however, is that it is SLOW - its slower than my 6 year old 1.7ghz desktop with 512 memory and it is slower than my wifes 2.0 ghz 5 year old dell notebook with 256mb memory.I\u0027m not sure if it is vista that makes it slow (I\u0027m pretty sure it is) - but be warned this is a pokey slow machine.","Imagine that you have a comp. with 1.5 GB RAM and Pentium 4; you can expect a \"normal\" performance at least, right? I used SiSoft Sandra to understand the reason, and here it is: integrated video eats the system memory!!! And there is nothing to do except using an external graphics adapter (I have no idea how to do that).","Shipping was fast and my laptop made it safe to my home.The first thing I checked is how many Memory slots (RAM) was occupied since I wanted to go first for the S609 with 1G RAM installed but I didn\u0027t want to risk with the 64MB Video Memory (I\u0027m so happy that I didn\u0027t).","I have read the earlier reviews on this site about putting to memory sticks in it and it wont work.","The DVD buttons above the keyboard turn it from a great laptop to an easy very portable DVD player.Comes with plenty of ports (USB, Ethernet, etc.)Some people may not like the fact that Sony is partial to their own stuff and only has their memory stick drive and doesn\u0027t include the standard one.","It says that the memory is shared, but, with 2gb of ram, a little of that memory dedicated to video, doesn\u0027t hurt anyone.The Speed of the hdd is very cool, that is because its a SATA drive.PROS:-RAM memory: 2 gb!!!-Nvidia Graphics-120 GB HDD SATA-Webcam-Remote Control-Lightscribe DVD burner-Really light weigth, for the size of the computer.-Really cool design in the black cover.CONS:-Low batery life (about 1.2 to 1.6 hours , depending on usage).","I still have 6 Gb of space available and purchased some Sony Duo memery cards at 4 GB each and have not yet needed them.The computer does store a full back-up in hidden memory whivh cuts the 32 GB down quite a bit but when I did require restoring the system it came in handy.This computer is for those who are on the go and can show presentations via Powerpoint by plugging it in at a remote work sight, connecting to meetings remotely or just wanting to read the newspaper while riding the bus to work.As far as software, I always hate trial versions, but after installing Office 2007 I had no problem uninstalling the trial version and it went fairly quick.","I have not added any extra memory.","The light is surprisingly useful when operating in a dark environment like a late-night plane flight.The ThinkPad control software provides a great deal of flexibility in managing power, timers and shutdown modes (including both memory-based stand-by and disk-based hibernation).","what\u0027s wrong with this crappy laptop?7) the windows xp professional operating system is a bad combination with this slow 4200rpm 40gb hard drive even you\u0027ve upgraded the memory from the meager panasonic factory installed 256mb to 1.2gb. all the reponding times of all the programs are so slow.there\u0027re so many other hateful things about this panasonic cf-51.","LX.A8605.470Dimension 1.5 in x 14.3 in x 11 in (HxWxD) The Athlon XP1800+ cpu is very fast and 256mb DDR memory is quite adequate when run on all pre Windows XP systems (we have it on others),....but when combined with Win XP this system is left without resources to be of any productive value.","The memory can be upgraded only 384 - from 256, bare in mind that the graphics card consumes 32MB of it, and in order to install an extra 256 - to get to 384 - you have to \"throw away\" the preinstalled 128MB one3.","That\u0027s when I realized that the shared-memory video card inside the Dell would never, ever play a 3D game like Half-Life 2 with any kind grace.","Because it\u0027s shared with system memory, people tend to think it\u0027s 64MB Intel graphics; believe me, it\u0027s NOT.","BEWARE! I bought a Toshiba A105-S101 from Best Buy with an additional 256 MB of memory for $499 in Feb `06.","They don\u0027t even have a Docking station yet, but they\u0027ll tell you the part number to order the \"phantom\" station.In their defense they have tried to compensate me by sending memory to update my system but they\u0027ve sent the wrong memory twice!I\u0027m giving it 2 stars since it worked beautifully when it was up and running and the screen is clear and bright! Oh, the DVD player on my system works great and I\u0027ve played it through my TV with no complaints! I\u0027m putting this review on several of the Compaq laptop systems since they are all from the same platform1.","I quickly added another gigabyte of memory, bringing the total to 1.25 gigabytes.","People look at it and say \"wow\".But, why would anybody pay more than $2,000. for this computer when a machine (even a laptop) with larger capacity, bigger screen, more USB ports, more memory, larger hard drive, better warranty and less expensive parts can bought for much less?The answer is: a footprint smaller than a letter sized sheet a paper; full networking; a built in CD/DVD drive; built in fingerprint reader; bright, high resolution screen; a seven hour battery life even when networked; more than adequate memory and hard drive suitable for all but heavy graphics; the ability to play DVD\u0027s without starting up Windows and a total weight of less than 3 pounds.My first concerns were: Can someone with \"older\" vision and reflexes actually read the screen and use the keyboard?I found that, although bright and clear, the screen is definitely small.","9) Does not accept Compact flash cards directly (Accepts a number of other memory cards) 10) Fans are noisy and you really notice how quite it gets when you shut down the machine.","Just make sure to purchase two (2) 1 GB memory modules in order to make it run more efficiently.","But what\u0027s the point? I might as well own a PC?Finally, I called Apple and they are refusing to take it back because they say I had it \u0027configured for myself\u0027, meaning I added a larger hard drive and memory, both of which are available on their website as an \u0027add on\u0027.","I only point this out because today with great machines like the MacBook Pro we\u0027re storing more of our great memories on computers than ever before, so make sure you don\u0027t lose them, if something happens to your machine.","I decided to get the more expensive white model due to the faster processor, 1 GB memory standard which is in my honest opinion is a minimum requirement with Apple, and the superdrive, plus some smaller upgraded cache features.","They include XP or windows 98and 12 or 20 GIG harddrive on board, more than enough for most applications, with USB ports in back or side of the note bookWhilest its not the newest or fastest machine out in stores.. it does get you online and handles just about anything with ease, plays your movies/DVDs and is a great computer to bang around without worrying too much!for $100 and change its a great deal!eric I included an extra memory order to be able to use this computer, nevertheless, Vista exasperated me soon.","Although you will probably want to go up to a gig of memory to get all the speed out of this puppy.2) Full sized keyboard - I am used to an ergo, but this isn\u0027t bad.3) Looks - Sony has the fashion edge.","I would recommend upgrading the memory if you\u0027ll be doing anything remotely intensive (just replace one of the 256 SODIMMs with a 512).","I would highly recommend upgrading the memory on this laptop.","also, the buttons that realease the express card slot as well as the memory card adaptor seem loose., as well as the keyboard, just doesnt seem to sit well.its a bit umfortable to have to carry aroud by hand... maybe im just paranoide but i cant seem to get a firm grip on the thing when the cover is closed.battery isnt as snug as i would like... it wiggles around still even when its locked in, but its not SO loose that the battery would fall of or anything..","Processor and memory are good selling points.","Every time I would use Windows Explorer in any way, the stupid WINDOWS program that supposedly \"protects my computer by monitoring how each program is using memory\" notice that my memory was being used \"incorrectly\".","The 512 ram means I can open several windows and not worry about memory.","This makes the applications fast to open and run.4) For a Sony quality, a price tag of $1400 is worth it.5) Has an inbuilt LAN wireless card for wireless connectivity.6) Sturdy body, can sustain some banging and rough handling.7) Comes with a Sony memory stick slot.","Another feature included is the sd card reader in addition to the memory stick pro reader.","pros:- good screen- nice design (sleek and thin)cons:- flimsy latches (both broken), poor CD door (also broken), plastic surrounding the power adapter \"peg\" inside of notebook broke off- battery life is awfull (lasted about 3 hours and now is totally dead)- very short power cord PROS:-Great compact size-Great screen resolution-3 USBs-Clean casing-Large hard drive for a small laptop-Dual layer DVD burner-Dual core processor-1GB of RAM-Very competitely priced-4-in-1 memory card reader and ExpressCard slotCONS:-ATROCIOUS BATTERY!!!!

Almost a perfect laptop....I owned 4 IBM laptops prior to this Macbook Pro 15, 2.4GHz, 2GB Ram,160GB HD.I used my Thinkpad X series for 3 years and finally it is now experiencing random blue screen of death (due to faulty aged motherboard or memory modules), which I am reluctant to buy replacement parts or repair (old 1.8GHz Centrino).This is my second Mac (I bought an iMac 20\" one year ago and really love it).","I just upgraded my memory to 2GB and it\u0027s still running smoothly.CONS...Rubber pads fall off on the bottom, and the battery life is only an hour and half at best.","The built-in speakers are very good indeed and well located.- The CPU fan is somehow more silent specially when controlled by the Toshiba Power Saving Modes.- Haven\u0027t tested the rest of the peripherals like DVD/CDRW but they seem to be of standard quality.Cons:- Misleading specs, Toshiba claims to include an Intel Celeron M 2.8Ghz CPU when in fact this is a your average OEM desktop CPU, Integrated 32MB VRAM video card is another wrong specs about this system since the Intel 852GME is an IGP that uses/shared system memory and allocates 16MB when you have 256MB or 32MB when 512MB is installed, these settings can\u0027t be changed by the user.- Heavy an bulky, another specs blunder by Toshiba on the A45 line, it\u0027s as thick as the 2199US on the front(1.6\") but the back is almost 2.5\" thick, also the sides are around 1/2\" - 3/4\" bigger than the 2199US.","I had to increase my memory up to 1.25 to handle my large iPhoto library and am actually considering another memory hit.","I purchased additional memory from a local vendor, which was easy to find and easy to install.","It\u0027s just simply a great all round value.The 2100US is more than fast enough with an Intel Celeron 1.6 processor and a handy 256 MB of the better DDR SDRAM memory.","You can\u0027t upgrade the RAM memory randomly.","The extra memory and large hard drive make it a bargain if you hunt around for the best price ...The CD burner isn\u0027t fast, but for personal use I don\u0027t think it makes a lot of difference.","After bumping it up to 1GB memory I was extremely happy.Sadly, though, it died.","Even while running several large graphics programs at once, the memory is never a problem, and it handles my husband\u0027s fastest video games like Warcraft III.","Both sport sharp 12.1\" 1024-by-768 LCD, 256 MB memory and 32 MB graphics memory, FireWire 400 and USB 2.0 ports, and 100/10 fast Ethernet.","I couldn\u0027t wait to get it in the mail.The smile went away quickly, this PC was no faster than my old DV1000 with the memory and processor.","And higher cache memory...however 1600 Hz of bus complements that.","The machine has more ports and slots than I have ever seen on a mid-range laptop-including a 6-in-1 digital Media Reader for memory cards.","a memory of 160 G with 40 G of installation for Vista is too much!a little noise from fan, really nasty for a 2000$ computer Am I ever glad I purchased this Macbook Pro from the Macbook Pro series.","A memory reader would be sweet, though!* Keyboard/Trackpad:I\u0027ll say it up front: I do not like the keyboard\u0027s response!

It has all the qualities you\u0027ll need for a business notebook (very good wireless, speed, memory, hd) and it\u0027s beautiful with a lot of blue leds!!Thank you amazon and Hp! I\u0027ve bought this Sony laptop because of the brand itself.","I use it as my primary PC for the most part, but I did have to get rid of Vista Premium and reload Windows XP Pro (32bit version) that I had, for many reasons.Probably one of the first things you will want to consider, is upgrading the memory on the system to 2 gigabytes.","The hard drive is very roomy and you can do photo and video editing with the input ports, drive space, memory and processor speed.","It has all the features you would expect from a high end notebook, with an amazing display, DVD/CD-R combo, firewire port, and memory stick slot.","There\u0027s plenty of hardrive space (120gb), enough memory(1gb), it comes with a dvd writer, a fingerprint reader as an alternative for passwords, 3 usb ports, SD card reader, integrated wireless, an intel centrino duo processor... in summary, you cannot ask more for this price(much better if you get the rebate offer).","Only have 512 MB memory.","The memory and video card about even.","The DVD/CD-RW drive drew me in, and the fast processor and generous memory sold me.","Today I was thinking of upgrading the memory from 256 to 512 so I stumbled on this site and thought that I\u0027d add my 2 cents for anyone who\u0027s thinking of perhaps getting one of these old relics as a starter computer for a youngster or something like that.","You can upgrade the memory easy enough aftermarket, but that\u0027s an annoyance (128MB is practically required for OS X, BTW).2) The screen is a fairly miserly 12.1 inches, although it is active-matrix and high-resolution.","Probably surprise her with another GB of memory for her B\u0027day.","When I compile an OGRE project, it will run out of memory sometimes.","Adjustable Video Memory - at CMOs, you can set you video memory vary from 8 - 64Mb.","I PROMISE you that this machine has 256mb of dedicated memory, not 512mb.","Underneath the keyboard you will find the extra space for an additional RAM memory module.HARD DISKAnnounced as a 60Gb disk, it really has a 55.5Gb capacity minus the pre-installed TIGER OS, which leaves around 42 - 43 Gb of free space.","The MacBook Pro supports up to 2 GB of memory.","And it being a generation or two before PowerBook G5 arrives, lacks some cutting edge technologies as well: high resolution 15.4\u0026quot; LCD, 7200 RPM hard disk, PCI Express card, faster FSB, digital audio I/O, and higher capacity battery with advanced power saving technologies.Until then, you should proudly carry 5th generation PowerBook G4, knowing it is among the most powerful and certainly MOST beautiful notebook on the market.Pros:- Feels very fast (helped by 1.25 GHz G4 processor with large 512 KB L2 cache, DDR RAM, and ATI Mobility Radeon 9600)- Very well equipped -- no additional hardware purchase required (although some will want more memory and/or extra battery)- Simply beautiful... the most beautiful PowerBook yet- Fantastic connectivity options- Light and slim for a desktop replacement notebookCons:- Among the most expensive notebooks in its class- While it feels fast, it is slower than many Centrino notebooks- 15.2\u0026quot; LCD is limited to 1280 by 854 resolution, which is among the lowest in its price range- It is slightly larger and heavier than previous Titanium PowerBooks- Shorter battery life than earlier PowerBook and many Centrino notebooks- Earlier builds are plagued with white spots on the LCD and lid not closing evenly (both issues should be fixed by now)- No docking station option It\u0027s been 5 years, this laptop has proven to be a reliable and solid machine.","It is a great choice for home users who want a work/entertainment system.Features:Processor Brand IntelProcessor Class Pentium MProcessor Speed 1.73 GHzMobile Technology Intel CentrinoInstalled Memory 512 MBMaximum Memory 2 GBMemory Technology DDR II SDRAMCache Size 2 MBHard Drive Capacity 100 GBIncluded Drives DVDRW (+R double layer)CD Write Speed 24 XCD Rewrite Speed 16 XCD Read Speed 24 XDVD Read Speed 8 XDVD Write Speed 8x (DVDR), 2.4x (DVD+R DL)Display Type TFT active matrixGraphics Processor Intel GMA 900Resolution 1280 x 800 pixelsBattery Life 2 hour(s)Battery Type Lithium ionModem Speed 56 KbpsNetwork Support Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11gOperating System Microsoft Windows XP Home EditionInterface Provided VGA, Phone line, Ethernet, HeadphoneInput Devices Keyboard, Touchpad, 4-way scroll buttonIncluded Sound Card Sound cardWeight 6.39 lbsManufacturer Part No.","Veiwing the shot full screen eliminates the need bracketing exposers, saving memory and post shooting production time.","The design is great! It looks stylish (looks better than Thinkpad), not very heavy (~6 lbs), awesome screen!A huge harddrive (60GB), good memory (512 MB RAM) but no DVD-RW drive, which is ok for me, since it has CD-RW.","For the size \u0026 memory, most other companies are charging several hundred more.","Five years ago the screen size, memory and HD determined the price.","The serious gamer won\u0027t find these acceptable, but for general use they are just fine, and most users won\u0027t find the slight jump in performance worth the big jump in price.What I personally liked most about this laptop was the fact that when I replaced the Windows Vista Home Premium with which it comes with Ubuntu 6.10 Linux, everything worked (with the exception of the built in memory card reader, which is very minor to me).","Face it, Intel doesn\u0027t make \u0027em like they used to- AMD for speed and stability.But this new one seems to be a lot nicer- I can play 3d games at a good rate (ok- the video card isn\u0027t good for 3d, but this processor rocks! And I have the 900Mhz, not the 1Ghz, also, with the games, it did good at 128MB memory, This modle that Amazon is selling can be upgraded to 128MB+256MB)DVD playback is great.Also, mine has been dropped several times and still works.This product, being the next improvement to the 1200 series should out perform mine in almost every respect... except one.","Sound is pretty good, not as good as my HIFI home system, but best I ever had in a laptop.Only complaint is that it was a little buggy until I upgraded the memory.","Vista had ReadyBoost, but the feature was limited to how many GB of flash drive memory could be used.","The only hickup that I see compared to a desktop is that in technical drawings,the rendering of parts during moving of parts within the technical drawing is no good but once you drop the part, everything works honkidori.Hope this helps.Conclusion: If you know where to locate memory modules for this laptop that will work and can bring you up beyond 10Gb, then I recommend this machine to you for this price.","If you are looking for additional memory, I would not go to Apple (compatible memory is much cheaper with other companies).-The screen size can feel somewhat small if you are working with graphics, yet financially it was difficult for me to make the 1,000 dollar jump to the MacBook Pro.","I could fix none of these, even after removing every memory resident program, uninstalling all unnecessary software, and using a professional defrag program.","If you are intersted to buy this product go for it and do not hesitate, the specification is really great if you compared it to the price.Very nice looking, thin, crystal clear screen and and and ...As I told you don\u0027t hesitate If you are in the market for a laptop that will do everything your desktop will do and more, and still be portable with decent battery life and lots of features, this is your machine!I continue to be impressed with this laptop two weeks after I have bought it...it does everything I ask very well.First, the tech info:1.6Ghz P4 mobile, 512 MB DDRAM, 32MB DDRAM Video card, 30GB Hard Drive.The ports are many and varied: Memory stick, PCMCIA, 3 USB, 1 Serial, 1 Parallel, 1 TV-out, iLink (Firewire), Microphone, Headphone.Cons: lack of external volume control is a big one for me.","I had to buy an EDGE PCMCIA card to be able to connect via my own mobile operator, comes with many applications installed (which I do not need) and you can\u0027t make a clean XP Pro installation, you have to unistall them one by one.Pros: Thank goodness it comes with XP Pro, extremely light and perfect for those who need to be online everywhere they go, seems more solid than my previous Vaio (VGN-T350P), has all the ports I need (SD, MS, 2xUSB etc.), battery lasts up to 10 hours, comes with 2GB memory installed.All in all, it is a good machine if you want a light and small laptop, but DO NOT UPGRADE TO VISTA.","The computer comes with 512 mb of memory.","Why get the Pro instead of the MacBook? Bigger display, accepts more memory, metal case, magnetic power cord.","Also, it has Shared Video Memory which takes from your 512 MB of memory, leaving you with 448 MB of main memory.Also, it has no memory stick slot, no floppy drive, and WORST OF ALL, a horrible graphics set with only 1024 X 760 resolution which, although common, is more suitable for a child.Basically, they stripped it of every bell and whistle to offer it for a cheap $1500.","Then, what seemed to be no more than 24 hours after my warranty expired, my memory slots go bad.","The laptop I received had half the memory and half the HD space as listed and when I emailed 5 Stars they initially said some line about it being my part to do due diligence in assuring my product choice, but I provided screen shots of my order confirmation and they really went out of their way to take care of the issue.","Didn\u0027t like that that the graphics card shares memory but will be upgrading to 1GB soon so that will be taken care of.","Plays movies well, has enough memory to do everything except play games.I am a student, so I bought this computer so I could take notes in class and be able to do my work while I was in away from home.","checked LCD,hard drive,memory, all good, but it just stopped working.","I am not going to go into great details about the specifications (like huge disk space, memory etc.) which are already bonuses.","At the very least go look at this beautiful LED driven screen and see what you\u0027re missing...or should I say not going to miss? ill just get straight to the cons and pro;Pros:-Very fast processor-2GB Ram (always around 40-50% used while just webbrowsing !)-200GB plenty of storage-Superb memory card transfer rates, especially for transer of material onto my psp memory card.-Quick play lanches in less than 10 seconds.-Solid body overall-the new x3100 graphics card by intel is magnificent, truely a amazing for an integrated graphics card, i play half-life 2 at max. options without a glitch.-very quiet-very light-excellent camera and mic quiality-cd\u0027s very quiet when inside-speaker quality is good-Beutiful display-doesnt make so much heat.CONS-Extreamly poor packaging-Over 20GB of preinstalled junk, at first i though so what if sony added a few programmes to try out, but this is too much i spent hours and hours removing everything.-Preinstalled antivirus programmes conflict and mess up my firewall-Screen hinge seems like after a few hundered opens and shuts it might crack or something.","The only other two optional upgrades Apple offers are a memory upgrade to 8GB and some hard drive options, but it\u0027s cheaper to upgrade those yourself.I\u0027ve been using Mac laptops for years and this is fine successor to previous models.","Memory: 768MB DDR SDRAM3.","I have yet to notice any improvement in speed over my Gateway with 512mb memory and basic processor.","Eventually I added a 512 MB memory stick for a total of 768 MB, and that fixed the slow-loading problem.Meanwhile, the computer started to shut down without warning, and after searching the Internet, I figured out that it was overheating.","I am getting decent battery life and found a way to extend it if you keep your data in memory sticks.","USB 1.1 is more than 3 years old and notebook makers like CPQ/HP should keep up with the rest of the industry instead of pushing an outdated technology.- Intel Celeron 2.8Ghz, 256MB RAM \u0026 40GB 4200RPM HD, \"diehard\" fan of AMD may be suprise of this CPU with 128Kb cache and 240MB of system memory performs as well as the AMD XP-M. Boot up time and overall usage of the system is a little slower than the 2199US, but with 240MB left(16MB for Video) it does a good job even when playing games or opening several applications at once, probably will give credit to the Intel chipset here again.- Battery seems to last around 3Hrs with normal usage like surfing and word processing.- Video card has good performance, with only 16MB got an 1700 score with 3DMark01 @ 1024x768x32 almost the same as the ATI IGP on the 2199US.- Most people claim that the support and service from Toshiba is far superior than HP/CPQ, can\u0027t account for that since I only had these systems for a few hours.- Audio, volume control is on the right hand side and adjustable by hand, unlike the 2199US that is dificult to reach and works only under Windows.","I have the same laptop shown, except my laptop has 1 gig of memory and it has a 100 gig hard drive, as shown the latop has 60 gig hard drive and 512 megabytes of memory.","And, it was as easy to replace as the memory (no braking open the case) Oh, and I had to get a 90 watt power adapter from the same place for $15 to handle the added demand of dual core.Performance was great.","Newegg has memory for it, and its cheaper than Apple\u0027s by far, and this MacBook is super easy to upgrade memory to 2 gig.","If you\u0027re going to be using your Powerbook, for more than basic consumer tasks, you will want to add more memory.Graphics - The 17-inch Powerbook now features 128MB of video memory standard, and the ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 card allows you to connect your 17-inch Powerbook to beautiful, big, displays such as the Apple 30-inch cinema display.Ports - The 17-inch Powerbooks have a great array of ports.","Laser Printers can be run on wireless networks.And why pay $1000 more for a lower memory Drive?If you can\u0027t afford it, then don\u0027t! But consider this in two years:* SSD will be the standard for all future laptops.This price will definitely go down in future renditions of the laptop and will no doubt be the standard in 2 - 3 years.","But it should be ok once you get a little used to it.Want to upgrade the memory? It would be a nightmare, if you want to do it yourself.","Again I only really have the standard Dell 610s and 410s to base this on but this HP touch pad has a texture to it I like much more.Secondly a laptop with these specs that includes 512 RAM for this price is impressive, but I think misleading: since the system uses shared video memory, and this is set to a minimum of 32 megs (set through the BIOS/CMOS), the most the actual OS will ever see is (512 - 32) 480 Megs.","That is probably the biggest risk you run with Toshiba, the poor service.What I suspect is that these multi-featured laptops cannot adequately meet the demands place on the system, even one with as much memory as this one.","I am very pleased with this purchase.I did upgrade the memory and replaced the hard drive although they were in good working order.","The only modification I have made is to install an additional 512k memory (total now of 1MB).","The speed and memory is perfect for this machine, I have ran several applications without any slowing down.","NOTE: This is review for Acer Aspire 1642WLMi Notebook;Part Number: LX.A8605.452Processor: Pentium M Centrino 740 at 1.73GHz, 2MB L2 cache;Memory: 512MB DDR2 (2 X 256MB RAM sticks, so both slots are occupied.);Hard Drive: 80GB 4200 RPM (Hard Drive Part Number: ST980829A -

There are three side by side and I noticed that when I connect a USB device (mouse) and a Lexar Flash Memory I am not able to use the 3rd, since it does not fit.DVD - I can not say they are all like this but the DVD drive was a bit loud.Overall, I can give this laptop 3.5 - 4 stars.","$3800 vs $1300 (I was willing to settle just fine on this point)All the features I wanted that DO come with this machine...1- Tablet PC (12-in screen)2- Light, very light (compared to my clunky 9-lb 15.4in Inspiron 8200)3- 2GB RAM4- 200GB HDD5- Bluetooth 2.0 (unbelievable how many modern machines come without it!)6- WiFi 802.11 n/g/b/a (n is draft, but it\u0027s still n !)7- Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000TX)8- Fingerprint reader9- DVD Quickplay (not as fast as I thought since computer needs to boot, but it works)10- Remote control (not intuitive, but it works)11- Built-in Webcam 1.3megapixels12- Built-in Microphone13- DVD Writer with Lightscribe (after you burn your DVD you can PRINT text and/or images on the DVD with the same drive built into the machine)14- SD/MMC/XD/MS-Pro Card reader15- PCI Express card slot16- 3xUSB ports, 1x 56kbps Modem, 1xVGA port, 1xExpressPort34, Front Speaker/Line/Headphone jacks17- 2-speakers18- Nvidia Video/Graphics Card does NOT have built-in memory... it is shared.","On top of this, they only have 64 Meg shared memory video cards and don\u0027t have S-video ports.","With a bright screen, nice keyboard, decent track pad, and a good balance of speed and memory, this computer will last until the computer evolution arrives.","They refused to send it to me and I was forced to purchase more memory on my own.","You just have to unscrew the back and pop of the little memory door and insert the new memory into the computer.","The mac starts really fast (the time of loading up will be an unpleasant memory, it (almost) never freezes or brakes down and it is actually fun to use.","Another time, the notebook was returned missing all the covers from the bottom (hard drive cover, memory cover, etc.)This time, the whole computer is missing and the customer support reps do not know the status nor where it is.","Really like the memory stick slot as I have several other SONY products.","The sound is terrific, plenty of USB ports, and an iLink port (Firewire) are available, as well as a monitor output and a parallel port.At 512 MB of RAM, memory is a little on the small side, especially in light of the fact that the VGA card uses some of it.Now, Sony support is easily the most disappointing ever.I cleared the hard drive in order to upgrade to Windows XP professional (it came with Home edition), and realized too late that there were no drivers included.","I do digital photography, and I can just pop my Secure Digital Cards right into the provided memory card slot and the photos \"Pop\" onto my bright, clear screen with a couple of mouse clicks.Also, I do a bit of video editting and assorted 3D graphics editting on the machine as well, and the laptop races through tasks as well as my AMD 64 bit 3400+ machine.","The switch to Intel processors is also great for Macs, and as for memory, the installed 1.667 GB is great, and easily expandable.","Cool feature.Also has built-in SD memory card reader/writer slot.I never seen such amazing small speakers with CLEAR and LOUD sound in any other notebooks.","Wireless is great as well as speed and memory.","As far as memory upgrades are concerned, for example, the documentation that comes with the unit (including the latest update) is wrong.","The only upgrade I performed was to add memory (my machine came with 1GB, the minimum to run Vista).","The 505Dx really seems to be targeted at people who want to do digital video or media, hence the extremely large hard drive, relatively souped-up video card, and relatively large amount of memory capacity.","To add more memory later on, you will need to toss out one of the memory modules (the other memory module is soldered onto the motherboard) Light, easy to use, good looks, I\u0027m very happy with my first VAIO so far.","I would reccomend upgrading the memory for $75.","So, that means instead of having 1 GB memory that you are dreaming about, you will only be able to upgrade it to 768 MB, which is not bad.","The ATI Radeon 7500 included in this laptop is DEDICATED video memory.","After looking over several models of laptops and owning about 1 new one each year, I drifted away from the super small, lightweights and back to a work horse, this thing seems rugged enough, has enough memory and I just replaced a hard drive in an older Sony Vaio that I had running non-stop for a couple years at the office.So I\u0027m giving Sony another shot.","[...]Enjoy! Really fast while running cs2 and archicad, considering they are memory hogs.","I don\u0027t remember seeing anywhere for sure that this machine supports TurboCache, and XP reports being able to use the full 2GB of memory, so my best guess is that DirectX is wrong.","But 2GB is all you need anyway.- DVD drive is a Philips and man is it noisy! I\u0027ve never heard a laptop drive read so noisily!- I have noticed that this laptop is a bit slow, especially when compared to other dual-cores with 2GB memory.","My notebook has an ML-40 2.2Ghz, 1GB memory, 80GB HDD and 1400x1050 LCD.Usually the 1st week I buy any computer I take it to the roughest possible tests.","30GB is definatly enough memory unless you are going to do a ton of imovies.I suggest that you buy it over the phone from apple though because they will give you deals for a lower cost.","The price with added memory brings this entry level comptuer up to the price point of a near top end PC.","The 2GB memory is really needed with Vista.","This laptop has 1GB of memory, which I would recommend since 512MB is barely enough today.","Play, pause, volume control buttons cannot be accessed with display closed.7) Speaker quality is below average.8) No built-in bluetooth support.Will update the review later as I put the laptop to use.Update:1)Battery life is poor.2)Below average speaker quality.3)No bluetooth.4)Not had any problems with Vista(yet).4)Graphics performance is good for a laptop with integrated graphics w/shared memory(Good job, Intel).5)Lots of pre-installed junk.6)Many websites with streaming videos won\u0027t work with opera/Firefox.","There is the good sized hard drive (60GB) and plenty of memory (512MB, standard).","So this 2.2 AMD seeems slightly faster than my desktop (which also has 1/2 the memory-takes SUPER expensive RDRAM if you can find the right type).I have had no problems out of the box, I was able to wirelessly network this thru a router and communicate with my desktop to access files.","It has 1 GB ram memory, 1.8 ghz processor, and 80 gb hard drive.","Also, very important, get 2 GB\u0027s of RAM (PC5300 or 5400 laptop memory) as soon as possible, you will thank yourself a lot.","But the slight difference in the CPU is unlikely to change the overall impression too much.I have previously used Dell inspirons and latitudes, actually currently owning a latitude D620 with T7200 (2GHz core 2 duo) and 2GB of memory.","It has all the right ports, and appears to be made with quality in mind.The screen is exceptionally bright as well.My only two complaints: 1) The low-end model skimps horribly on the memory (for shame, Apple!

The battery has good charging time and goes for a good few hours without needing a recharge.","The battery life is a bit short (2 hours) but more batteries are reasonable.The keyboard is well designed, something hard to find on a low-cost small machine.I\u0027ve owned 20 notebooks and this is my second favorite (after my old Libretto).","But the battery life is so bad that I would never, never buy this computer again.","The battery jiggles a little in its housing, giving the whole computer a somewhat ramshackle feel... as if it is about to break... and lo, it did... multiple times so far.","Get prepared to pay $$$ for replacement batteries.","The touch pad worked well too and comes with a nice button to turn it on or off so you don\u0027t brush it when you type.Battery life: The 6 cell battery was only mediocre for a laptop this size.","Then I discovered that on campus the wireless connection would drop every few minutes, even in areas of excellent signal strength, where many other people were using laptops with no problem.I really liked the machine but the so-so battery life, xp pro problems, and wireless problems were enough to convince me to return it (staples gave me no problems).","The reasolution is near perfect, it works great, comes with many programs already installed, has a good battery life and it is the best looking laptop in its price class by far.","I have to duck tape the battery in in order to move from place to place.","Doesn\u0027t that look nice? Our previous laptop was a tobisha and I wish now I had purchased a new tobisha instead The battery life on this machine is disgusting.","(I\u0027ll probably gripe about the built-in battery every couple of years when I replace it, then forget it the rest of the time.)","Sony has refused to replace the battery despite its battery issues and recalls, and the customer representative I spoke with accused me of not knowing how to care for a battery, e.g. charge, use, draw down fully, re-charge.","I have tried with just battery, with AC on before I turn it on, with wireless off and on, it makes no difference and it is frustrating to no end.","CMOS battery went within 2 weeks.","I am what they call a \u0027heavy\u0027 user that runs multiple applications, databases and servers simultaneously on a laptop all the time and I have not been disappointed by this laptop.Aside from a fast processor and the IBM/Lenovo reliability the features that made me choose this laptop over all others (including Dell and Sony) are:Keyboard: the keyboard bed on this laptop is strong, on other laptops if you push down a key the keyboard depresses and bends, not on this laptopBattery life: I installed an extra battery pack and it lasts a full 2.5 hoursWireless Reception: the reception on this laptop is much better than on any Dell that I have used.","What else can you ask for?The 12 inch TFT display is so gorgeous and brilliant that you\u0027ll want to exchange your 29-inch TV for this beauty when watching DVDs and with up to 6 hours of battery life you\u0027ll be able to play for a long time without worrying about constant recharges.","As for a carry on when traveling abroad..no problem 15 pounds or so (battery included) so worth it! If I was to do it all over again I would of just purchased the 8010 model for a couple hundred more.","The superdrive can get a little loud at times, battery life isnt the greatest, but the worst thing i have found is that the laptop get extremely hot after extended use.","I won\u0027t part with the HP! Smooooth is the word for the HP, and the larger battery lasts forever.","Not to mention, the LCD screen is beautiful, the colors are brilliant, and it saves on energy which in the end, saves on battery power and helps with the temperature of the unit.","And no others for the last 8 years, with the exception that the battery did die on my a few years ago.","Used mostly on my daily commute with 3 hours of train rides, I had to purchase a used battery to complete the day since the main battery lasts 2 1/2 hours only.","In addition, the system ran slower after each software installation, even though none were running in the background.Also, the disc, battery and blue tooth lights are located at the bottom of the keyboard, right where your left hand is placed.","The only thing I would like to point out is that the battery life is limited unless you purchase a larger 6-cell.","but still...- i wish they had some sort of extended battery pack included or as an option.","Now what gives -- I\u0027m plugged into electricity and now another half hour later I\u0027m down to about 6 minutes battery life and the laptop dies.","Here\u0027s what I look for:\u0026gt; long battery life (for plane flights)\u0026gt; minimal sacrifice of processing power, HD space, keyboard, other features\u0026gt; painless wifi and ethernet access\u0026gt; other cool, smart things I can showoffThis VAIO is great on a number of fronts:1.","I like the 64mb of video.But how can you watch a DVD in 1 hour when the battery is just going to die???? I really like this machine, the small format is great for carrying it everywhere, it is reasonably light and battery life is excellent.","The battery also stopped working when it was 3 years old which the Vaio customer service center said was about the life time of a battery.","While working in Battery mode with wireless turned on, if you plug in the AC, it freezes.","As power users wait patiently for PowerBook G5, Apple gives us the most matured PowerBook G4 to date.No major breakthrough here, but all are nice to have:- Faster CPU: 7447A running 1.5 GHz vs. 7447 running 1.25 GHz- Faster GPU: ATI Mobility RADEON 9700 vs. ATI Mobility RADEON 9600- Faster SuperDrive: writes CD-RW, DVD-R, and DVD-RW at double the speed- $100 cheaper- Fixed various manufacturing defects that plagued previous generation (e.g., bad LCD)All in all, these additions make up the fastest and most trouble-free PowerBook G4.Still... there are things missing:- Long battery life: although Apple specifies 4.5 hours of battery life, you will be lucky to get 3 (most will get 2 to 2.5 hours under typical use)- Faster hard disk: although you can specify 5400 RPM hard disk as built-to-order option, it bundles 4200 RPM hard disk (not optimal for GarageBand and iMovie)- High resolution LCD: year after year, the 15-inch PowerBook is still stuck at 15.2\" running 1280x854 resolution; Apple should offer higher resolution 15.4\" as an option for power users- New Bluetooth 1.2: it includes older Bluetooth 1.1- No digital audio output: most notebooks don\u0027t yet offer this, but Apple should- Slower in most respect than high-end Centrino notebooksIf you need the best portable running Mac OS X today, this 15-inch PowerBook is it (unless you can comfortably carry 17-inch).","The battery life was down to 20 minutes and the laptop was RED HOT and couldn\u0027t be held on your lap.","Battery life is as advertised at nearly six hours of realtime use with wireless networking in use and the computer barely gets warm.","As with **any** computer, it takes the knowledge to d\u0027load drivers, tweak the bios, and maintenance one to keep it running properly! I purchased this notebook for 1999.98 USD which included the docking station and speakers.The Centrino CPU auto steps when on battery to less than 700 MHz, but while plugged into it\u0027s AC power supply runs at 1700 MHz which is close to the performance of a 2500 MHz Pentium 4.I love the screen, the resolution and briteness of this screen is far greater than any notebook I have ever seen before.","This laptop\u0027s battery power is great also! the 3 past laptops I\u0027ve had Sony Vaio, an HP, and, an apple haven\u0027t run as well as this amazing pice of engineering and machinery.","The ports are now no nonsense... no covers to flip open or remember to close.Bottom line if you are looking for a \u0027multimedia\u0027 laptop powerhouse with decent battery time and the latest features at a resonable price... this one works.","I think I also had a low battery issue.",":(- The battery is slightly loose, and when you\u0027re carrying the laptop it feels as if it is very fragile.- Although the harddisk is advertised as 100 GB, it shows around high 80s.","Otherwise the keyboard is great, I feel it is very confortable, and it runs very smoothly, battery life does suck, but with a spare battery (one bought at some other place with more battery life)that problem was fixed.","On battery life the personal experience and many of the Apple magazine reviews are now also stating the same point, that the Apple batteries seem to take some time to build up to their maximum life/charge, so expect only just over a few hours in early days of portable usage.","New Superdrive could be quality control problem like permanent white spots on screens and batteries that catch fire of earlier models.","I\u0027ve had this laptop for almost three years and have never experienced any of the problems mentioned in any of the other reviews.The only negative thing that I can think to say about this laptop is that it\u0027s bulky.I still have the original lithium battery and unplugged, it lasts a bit less than an hour, but I\u0027m not unrealistic about battery performance.I occasionally wish that I had a bit more RAM, but that\u0027s when I\u0027m deep into processing very large files via Photoshop CS2 and Adobe Bridge.","However, it STILL doesn\u0027t charge the battery.","This may be annoying to persons like me because I for example took the battery off my Toshiba laptop, I don\u0027t need it for use at home.","I spoke with them today, and they have called Toshiba to declare the laptop a lemon, only to be told that just because nothing they do (by now they have also replaced the battery) can cause the thing to keep its charge over 90 minutes doesn\u0027t make it a lemon.","It runs *extremely hot* the fan operates all the time, it is noisy, the battery stopped taking a charge worthy of unplugging it about 6 months after I purchased it (even with careful management to try to extend the battery life).","If you\u0027re looking to run DVD\u0027s all the time, or constantly stay on the Wireless network, then you\u0027re not going to get good battery life.","Not terrible but I can see how it may be annoying to some people.The other bad thing about this unit is that it will only accept Sony brand batteries, so if you want a high power battery expect to pay $250-350 instead of about $100.00 for an OEM.What sold me was the high quality LCD display, the best and sharpest one I have seen, even though it does not compare with my desktop CRT.Other than the battery issue, I would give this unit 5 stars.Jim Christensenwww.uwphoto.net There is no compelling reason to ever own a desktop machine with the likes of the fabulous Apple Powerbook.","Because it is a reconditioned unit, I found that the battery would not fully recharge.","Number 3 is by far my biggest gripe due to the lacking battery life.","Selling a laptop with a battery life of one hour and not having that in the literature is not excusable.","While the product didn\u0027t meet my needs, the quality of the battery, user manual and tech support was very good.I bought the unit online from CompUSA, but returned it to a CompUSA store and they took it back and even reimbursed the shipping.","Battery doesn\u0027t last very long.2.","I have unplugged my computer and then replugged it in and the battery is not charging which means that the battery did not discharge while the computer was off.","The small screen is amazingly bright, and the stick of a battery powers this laptop for good hours.","It depends on your needs, but you will not go wrong with these computers as long as you don\u0027t mind the size and the short battery life.","Another minor grip is the fact that the battery lasts on average 1.5 hrs for me.","But the best is:\"It\u0027s a new battery saving feature.\"","This is EXCELLENT for a six-cell battery under the conditions I put it in.Next, I tested the laptop battery for word processing on the lowest brightness possible with power saver mode.","It is a pretty decent laptop for basic use for spreadsheets, word processing, and other low memeory using software.Pros:- Good deal for the money.- 2.4 Ghz processor.- Good memory upgrade.- 40 GB IDE Hard Drive.- High speed internet card.Cons:- The battery charge does last very long.- The video card has only 32 MB of built in RAM on the motherboard.","The body shows a visible bending with just a little push by fingers.The one I got might also be a defect, since the battery doesn\u0027t attach well with the notebook.","This software got a simulation view which will show you when your laptop is getting shock or tilting and when it is protected..Good one.ThinkVantage-all softwares Rescue \u0026 recovery,Pc-Doctor at this point,Check this one at IBM.com.This thing weighs 4.76 pounds as specified,I feel that this should be pretty easy to carry around.Includes a 7-cell standard Lithion battery comes on a avg. of 4 hours(approxi.),cons:512 MB Memory,despite the fact it expensive,they gave me a mere 512 MB RAM,(Neverthless I have added an 1GB additional Memory-Runs Amazing )Overall I feel this is a really amazing laptop,might take you sometime to get this one as lenovo has issues with orders (I mean It took me 6 weeks to get this one),But its worth it.Highly recomended for heavy users who are looking for almost perfect laptop I got this laptop and have been playing around for a whole day now.","I have had very good luck with it, and I am on it all the time!!I have had to replace one battery, which was covered under my extended warranty, and it is in the shop right now, because I believe the wireless card has gone out in it.I really couldn\u0027t be more pleased with a laptop! We have had several Emachine Desk tops and have been equally please with them.I have had several friends buy an Emachine laptop with my recomendation!! We all LOVE them!!Kathy I have had my Gateway MX7120 for a little over a year and I love it.","The computerworks, but the battery is DEAD.","Battery life is exceptional compared to previous corporate laptops I\u0027ve owned.","When I took out the battery, it started right up.","Have had diffulty finding replacement battery.","I have played FEAR and Doom 3 at 1024x768 with no problems, and I can play Rise of Legends at the full resolution of the laptop.The battery life has been around 2hrs or so, which is great for a laptop with this performance.","I HAVE BEEN USING THE NOTEBOOK FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND FOUND IT TO BE \u0027EXCELLENT\u0027 IN TERMS OF ITS OUTPUT.SONY COULD HAVE ADDED THE \u0027FLOPPY DRIVE\u0027 OR THE \u0027WIRELESS CONNECTION\u0027,THE BATTERY LID IS BIT LOOSE, BUT ANYWAY UPTILL NOW IT\u0027S MONEY\u0027S WORTH.OVERALL GOOD BLENDING OF\u0027 DESIGN\u0027 AND \u0027SOFTWARE\u0027COLLECTIONS PRE-INSTALLED BY \u0027SONY\u0027.","I recently purchased this beautiful machine on discount at CompUSA and I knew this was the laptop that I was looking for.This laptop is truly a DESKTOP REPLACEMENT (don\u0027t look for battery life to be stellar) with jaw-dropping specs even for a desktop (except for the graphics which seem a little undersized with a FX Go5200 64MB).","What happened to the 12 month battery warranty? Battery location should have been closer to the front of the computer to prevent it from wanting to tip backward.","I am going to tell the problems I have had with it first because that\u0027s probably what your most interested in.The biggest problem I had was the battery.","On top of my HDD and Battery mixed up.","Fortunately I\u0027ll always be using a mouse with the thing.My only other complaint is battery life seems a little shorter than advertised.","Bought the computer 3 months back and mailed the rebate form within a week and opted for extra battery instead of cash.","If you plan on using this off a power source, buy the extra large battery.","Don\u0027t go on a trip without the power cord...in fact don\u0027t go anywhere without the power cord since at peak usage battery life is at best 45 min.Read the product specs carefully: amazon touted this little gem with an extra 512 stick of ram for free.","The fans are very loud when they kick in and I do keep this on a fan pad, otherwise it heats up very quickly.The only other issue is that the battery dies very quickly (so it must be treated like a desktop) but overall this machine is very fast for when it was built and does not drag at all with standard specifications.","Battery life seems to run a little over 3hrs with continuous use and weighing a little over 4 lbs, it is light! The wifi works like a champ and connected easily with my D-Link unit at home.","The battery life is decent as well though I always keep it plugged anyway.","I was told that in such a situation, it\u0027s a good idea to try to run the unit without the battery in place.","I can\u0027t get more than 2 1/2 hours of battery time with all the bells and whistles running even when battery is fully charged.","I sent back my dead battery in the pre-paid box and didn\u0027t even have to step out of my house because it was picked up.I hope the horizontal screen problem is as easy as a software update or firmware update.","It must be close to 9 pounds with the battery, 10 pounds with the AC adapter, and 14-15 pounds with you lap top bag and all the miscellaneous stuff you carry around.","but then again u can always buy extra battery.","This would not be a problem if Sony would sell me a replacement connector, they want (money) for a repair person to fix it.The other problem is that the batteries do seem to go soft after a while.","Among many options I choose this one for many reasons:- Great price- Great desing and look- No MS Windows in it (so I will less vulnerable to viruses)- Excelente application availability (MS Office, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Flash, DVD Authoring, DVD Burning, MSN Messenger, eMail, etc, etc, etc).- Rock solid platform (*nix based).- Good device support (From OSX or *nix)- iSight camera is awesome- Battery performance (up to 4 hours doing stuff like browsing the web, email and chat at the same time).- Huge touchpad- Superb backlit keyboard (nice feeling too)I have read many complaints about this laptop being too hot to use, but as far I can say, I haven\u0027t noticed excessive heat coming up from it.There\u0027s only one minor flaw that could be fixed at newegg for $45: You need 1024Mb RAM to unleash the full power of the CPU, if not, opening Rosetta translated apps will take more time, but after that, the app will work fine.Wireless conectivity is a snap, more friendly than Windows.It took me like 4 days to get used to the new OS, but now I\u0027m like a fish in the water.In short, if you are looking for a laptop that could replace your desktop, or you need power mobility and don\u0027t need to run any particular application that\u0027s availiable to Windows only, then this could be the one that\u0027s for you, as it was for me.","The speakers also sound really good.The downside is probably the battery.","Battery life was a known quantity going in so it was about what I expected.","I have come to prefer to watch movies on my laptop as opposed to my television!I noticed another reviewer complaining about the low battery life.","Buy a second battery or wait for an afermarket 12 cell battery to give you 6+ hours of battery life.","Their options for the consumer is to either send in the defective part and they\u0027ll ship out a new part, taking around 4 weeks according to one CSR, thus giving you no way to charge the battery and rendering the unit dead for the duration or to keep the fire and safety hazard of a power supply and hope nothing happens.","However, they were easily removed since such extras would have slowed down the computer anyways.At the time of sale, I was warned by the salesperson that Sony VAIO batteries in general tend to degrade sharply after 12 months.","Battery life is pretty bad (2 hours) and the touchpad is too slippery.","It has a locking mechanism to secure the battery to the main unit.I actually like the keyboard better than my old Sony notebook (K-series).","Don\u0027t be fooled by it being rated as a 1 GHz processor, because a 1 GHz processor in a Mac is much faster than a 1 GHz IBM compatible computer.Furthermore, the battery life is amazing for a laptop (approx.","You really must order the extended life battery.","The battery lasted about 3 hours with constant typing and everything geared down.Vista has some cool features to it like drop shadow around the windows but it sure takes some getting used to.","The battery manager is simple to use and set up well, you can simply select your preference, to conserve power or high performance etc.","the best aspect is its battery that can actually give you over three hours of operation.","I think apple\u0027s biggest mistake with the new laptops is the nonremovable battery.","I havent used the battery much but I dont rate it great.... just average.","I had this thing for about a little over a year, and it burned out.To begin the list of problems I had with it, the AC adapter was always loose, and the battery power goes out quickly.","A laptop isn\u0027t much good if you can\u0027t charge the battery.","Everything runs much faster!- 2 GB of RAM!!!!!! - You don\u0027t see that often in an 1,100 computer, especially one as well equiped as this.- Battery - Average.","So if you are looking at this item, make sure to count the extras that you would have to add to another laptop to make it do all the things this one does.Although the look of a computer is one of the least important, admittedly, it is very attractive and a discussion piece no matter where you go.I do not want to talk about the harddrive size and memory since this will be different in different models.Pros:SizeDisplayIntegrated CDRW/DVD(RW)Integrated WifiIntegrated Camera

life or so.","First of all after using it for almost 2 years I have 4 minutes of battery life.","The battery sticks out about an inch from the rear.","The battery only lasts about 20 minutes now but I have an outdooe ground-fault outlet near an old gazebo that is live and safe.","Lets get to what you want to hear, the cons, if you dont care about these, buy it:1)Keyboard, terrible layout, you get used to is a few month\u0027s later, unfortunately no one else has your layout so using someone elses computer, say your jobs for example, is hell.2)Battery Life : Hour and a half at the most if being used.","I have the 12 cell battery and consistently get 5 to 5-1/2 hours on a charge.","I am getting about 3.5hrs w/the standard battery.","I could use my sapphion external battery and charge it in the car and have continious laptop use with the power out.","(...)About the product...Pros:-excellent screen-Nice keyboard-Nice touchpad (configurable)-Good performance but not for gaming-sery slim, lightweight, sexy notebookCons-battery life is exactly 100 with full brightness-slight humming noise when brightness is not set to full otherwise runs very cool-shared RAM ... not for heavy graphics uses-hard disk is slower but I don\u0027t care-Short keys S1, S2 are not well designedconclusion:A must buy notebook about two weeks after the warranty ended.","But, with advanced power management features, the battery lasts about 1:45, which I consider poor for such a high-end machine.","There wasn\u0027t too much destruction done other than some of the lineing on the left edge of the screen and the battery doesn\u0027t fit as smoothly as before.","The battery life is not bad either, I typically get about 4 hours on a single charge.","No hardware problems, no dead pixels, touchpad still works, battery life still about 2 hours.","The change from a 64MB onboard card to a 32MB onboard card was not great but when running games at the highest resolution, the ibook has a good enough display to make it worth keeping.5) Battery life: The Compaq advertised 2 hours of life but usually put out 1 hour if I was typing or listening to music.","Mostly the fan-It produces a lot of heat.-Battery time (I expected to last at least 3 hours).","But I hear you can buy longer lasting batteries so maybe I\u0027ll change my review later.","Great for watching DVDs on road trips (although you\u0027ll need a DC adapter, the battery won\u0027t last for a full movie).","The speed is topnotch, the screen clear and bright, the battery life good.","You can pretty much do what you need to do on a mac that you used to do with a PC.My macbook usually accompanies me in my travels as it\u0027s light enough to lug around (much lighter than my 6.4lbs 15.4in pc laptop), has great battery life, and excellent power management that not only improves battery life but maximizes the lifespan of the battery.","When I first bought the laptop the battery would last around 90 minute in practical use with high screen brightness, wifi turned on, and using Youtube every now and then, but after two years of use the battery life has literally dwindled to a mere twenty minutes.","Worked great when it was plugged in, but the battery would not charge so I had to send this one back too.","I gave you the benefit of the doubt and placed anorder, thinking a huge company with such an established name couldn\u0027tpossibly want to screw me for a battery.","If you go from battery to AC while you are on wireless then the system simply freezes.I noticed the DVD drive made a horrible loud sound when it was reading data.After keeping the system on for about 5 hours I noticed that the laptop was beginning to get quite hot.","Battery life is not outstanding, but workable.","HORRIBLE battery life.... this is a 4 cell battary.. which means the laptop needs to be recharged every 2 hours or so.","I had to leave it for 2 days to exhaust the battery, and then put it on AC power and we were away again.","The battery lasts for about three hours if you do not change any settings to extend battery life; the power saving settings are available, but I don\u0027t need to use it for more than three hours at a time so I never made the changes.","I don\u0027t run the computer on battery power, so this is not a problem for me.- The brightness of the screen varies depending on how the AC adaptor is plugged into the computer.","Battery life could be better.","I\u0027ve owned this laptop for about eight months, and its battery life has dwindled to about 45 minutes, from a high of about two hours.I assumed that a Sony product would, at a minimum, have decent audio quality, but the speakers are so quiet-- even at full volume-- that headphones are a necessity.As a desktop replacement, this computer works fine.","Me I\u0027m sold! I got the ibook over the powerbook due to the fact that 1) I am not a graphic designer, 2) the battery life, 3) the price, and 4) I didn\u0027t like squinting at the 12\" screen.","That\u0027s my second iBook G4 12\".This notebook is amazing, more than five hours of battery, fast, small and portable.","And, the big problem, the battery that it comes with only lasts an hour.","I love this as well as I can read my personal outlook emails on the device and my personal gmails at once without them being deleted so my regular laptop still has a full email record.I am starting to use the MSFT Origami interface that comes with it, and so far I like the interface for playing music.The device only has 1 gig of ram, but I have open and am using onenote, windows live mail, lotus notes, a few browser windows, word and am playing music on it with only the most occasional music stutter.... with the Vista OS.It launches applications slowly once you have consumed the ram and the hard drive isn\u0027t all that fast ... but once launched it swaps between applications fine.(+- 11 sec to load excel as opposed to +- 4 sec on my fast LT)Remember I only bought this to take electronic notes on ..... but I may even leave my laptop at home next trip.I am buying the larger 6 cell battery (I think it should have come with this already for the price) but I got over +- 3.5 hours with wireless on and connected with the std battery.","Battery/TV tuner issues.","It works fine on battery and plugged in, so I really didn\u0027t lose any functionality.The laptop operating system doesn\u0027t break down, although it does freeze every once in a while.","This has not been a problem at all on my system.I have competed in a Laptop Battle with this machine as well, running on batteries with no problems either.","Currently I can still power the laptop but cannot get the battery to recharge, and if I bump the cord the unit simply shuts off with no warning.","A simple use of Dust Off being sprayed into the bottom fan intake blew out lots of dust and no more random shut downs.The only two things bad I found was the short battery life and the fact that in less than a year my battery life has decreased to less than a half an hour on two different batteries no.","The note book still see only 1 battery anyway (it will choose to see one that has less charge) but it actually charging for both.","The latest drivers solve some battery management/overheating problems that early reviewers have mentioned.","I removed the battery, restarted without the battery; reinserted and it worked ok from then on.","(4) On the heavy side at almost 8 lb (including battery, not including charger, adapter etc.).","While in idle mode it barely seemed to sip the battery.","The battery life is short.","Toshiba has finally done it!It blitzes the field on most major points: massive RAM (expandable to 2GB), although I would have liked to see faster RAM, generous hard drive (80GB, 5400rpm), although I would have liked to see 7200rpm, huge screen that is perfect for wide-screen movies, built-in TV tuner, the latest Wi-Fi capability built in (802.11a/g), four USB 2.0 ports, FireWire port, although the placement of this port is not ideal, legacy parallel port, although it has no legacy serial port, dual monitor support, external CD controls, DVD-Multi drive that does EVERYTHING in one \u0027box\u0027!, built-in modem and ethernet, PCMCIA cardbus Type I and II, Harmon/Kardon speakers, although I am disappointed that Toshiba did not include the sub-woofer as with previous models, and so much more.My only other disappointments (but not enough to dampen my enthusiasm) are the short battery life (1.5 hours, but this is to be expected with such a powerhouse), not the best bundled software (MSWorks instead of MSOffice?? Come on, guys!), average soundcard (but this is no problem with the plethora of USB and PCMCIA soundcards now available), and not the maximum graphics RAM (64MB... would have expected 128MB in an extreme machine like this).When all is said and done, though, I\u0027m stoked! I\u0027ve taken out extra insurance on this baby! I\u0027ve been working on and with computers (mainframes) since 1967 and personal computers since 1990.","The computer is in great shape like the seller said it was a great price for what the price was the battery doesn\u0027t stay charged without the charger but it still was a good price.Thank you The computer is nice from a design point of view but has a fatal flaw. the heat from the exhaust fan is so hot that you can\u0027t put it on your lap for any period of time.","Each had different settings for the same usage and each insisted on adding its own battery meter to the Taskbar.","I bought this Macbook less than two weeks ago and have upgrade the memory from 1 GB to 2 GBs without any problem on my own! I called technical support before I ordered it and they were helpful and friendly! The new airport extreme is very valuable in picking up wi-fi signals! It boots up very fast and battery life is awesome! Small but powerful! You can even run windows on it - but don\u0027t care to! The new leopard operating system rocks! Buy one and you will never go back to PC or Windows!Sincerely,Jeff I bought this MacBook to replace a 12\" PowerBook G4 that died on me a few months ago, and let me just say - I absolutely love it.","Battery seems to last about 3 hours 20 min.","I hope that a new battery isnt needed every year, because that would be just ridiculous.","The keyboard (shamelessly copied from Apple, IMHO) is responsive and nice to use; the screen is out-of-this-world clear and bright; and the specs for the price are extremely comparable to the real competition, which is the smaller Dells.So far, I\u0027ve nothing to complain about except the battery life, which is not at all bad when you\u0027re not doing much, but runs down fast with a DVD going.","My former laptop was a Presario 2500 and the screen wasn\u0027t bright enough without having it maxed out which reduces battery time.Good keyboard ,sound is very good, only negative is the cpu fan runs constantly but not real loud.","My laptop has outlasted my brother\u0027s Toshiba, countless Dells belonging to friends, AND a Macbook.-Battery never lasted more than 2 hours.-CD/DVDrom is kind of noisy.I definitely recommend this model.","The front media bay can accept another battery for marathon sessions in class or in transit at airports.","Battery somewhat disappoints.","Still have not figured out the buttons, i.e. shifting to symbols instead of letters.It stalls a lot and I have to take the battery off and put it back on frequently.","Third, the battery life is so low as to be an embarrassment.","The laptop has very good build: light weight, LED back-lit screen, \u0026 4 to 5 hours battery life at one full charge.","That is bad business!Battery - this is one place I don\u0027t have many complaints.","Not a big deal but what may be a savings of minutes of power when on battery is a bit of a gimmick.The drivers....","Boot time was cut in half, if not more, and my free RAM had jumped up over 100 megs.Even if you don\u0027t upgrade the RAM, you\u0027ll speed up this machine both at start-up (because fewer things get loaded) and in general operation (because you have more free RAM) just by uninstalling a bunch of the pre-installed software.Once the RAM issues are solved, if you\u0027re not doing disk-intensive functions, you\u0027ll find the machine quite apt for most tasks, though the battery life could possibly use some improvement.Overall, though, it\u0027s a gorgeous machine (love the display - nice and bright, good for DVDs) and once that RAM is installed, it performs pretty well for the price.","The battery life is over 2.5 hours, which is good and well within parameters for its class.","If you need a notebook that is ultra-portable, has great battery life, and is loaded with features, the iBook is the notebook for you.Soli Deo Gloria! After a couple of months of searching, I eventually settled on buying a couple of these laptops for my engineers.","But it\u0027s the same thing- Frustrated that a lot of apps I was used to weren\u0027t available for the Mac- Occasionally, the screen would get \"scrambled\" and I would need to move windows around to refresh it- Battery life wasn\u0027t as good as I hoped.","I had been reluctant to adapt to notebook PCs due to the small keyboards and most laptops/notebooks are not really either small nor light.I bought mine as if by love at first sight, beautifull siver, 1\" thick and 4.5 lbs in weight, it stood out on the shelf.The Averatec is fast enough so that you really won\u0027t miss ultra fast processing (wouldn\u0027t make sense to expect workstation or gamestation ultra speed in a notebook for the road) I would think.It\u0027s a problem of definition, for me a \"portable PC\" is just what Averatec packages in the 3270, the best performance you can get economically.With a 60/80 Gb HD, DVD burner, wireless card, SMALL and LIGHT frame, 2.5 hour battery, great screen, 512 Mb memory...I watch DVD\u0027s, browse, work with Photoshop, listen to music and get asked frequently \"what PC is that... for how much..?It does perfectly well all that is not \"extreme\", but then again, how much extreme do you need..?Makes me feel great.I dumped my Toshiba Satellite and wouldn\u0027t pay 2000 bucks for a replacement, I tell you.But got mine for $900.00 and got a $150 bucks rebate.Need to have the fastestes or most expensive..? Don\u0027t look here.Need a PORTABLE PC...?Get an Averatec ! I had been researching on ultramobile PCs for quite a while and even looked at the Asus Eee PC, which is cheap but has a terrible low-res low-quality screen (and weighs a hefty 2 lbs, the same as my Sharp PC-MM20 *real* laptop with more memory and a 40GB hard drive).","In a way I\u0027m glad for this, as it affords better protection and got me into the practice of being more gentle to the laptop.* Last but not least, the laptop battery: Not only did it never last much more than 2.5 hours (it was supposed to be at least 3), after about 2 years the battery started failing.","I have gotten as much as 4 hours from a fully charged battery, and have gone two days without plugging it back in by putting it in sleep mode.It does have some drawbacks.","longer battery life (it gets about 3.5-4 hours now.","It was great to give my feet a break at a coffee shop and jump online with the WiFi which is everywhere now.Secondly, the battery life is also superb.","So far my two nitpicks are that the battery isn\u0027t great - 4+ hours of internet/itunes if the screen brightness is down all the way... but i like to keep the brightness at at least 50%.","If battery life is critical to you, this may not be your model (for that your best bet from Amazon would be a high-end Toshiba or HP with a 14\" screen and a 8-12 cell battery).","Because a little left rubber piece is attached directly to the battery.","Brightness is good, and has many levels so one can save power and battery life by turning it down if you want.","And the player itself plays whatever it feels like playing on any given day.The buttons on the mouse are beginning to stick, and since this is a laptop I can\u0027t fix this simple problem myself, I\u0027d have to take it to a bunch of geeks to tinker at it, all the while enjoying the stacks of p0rn I\u0027ve downloaded.The Big Beautiful screen already has some Big Black dead pixels, which not only is annoying but will most-likely begin to spread like the plague.The battery no longer holds a charge and the power cord gives out without resisting.","We sent it in for warranty repair in August 2006 and it was returned like new, with a new battery and power cord.Now, in March 2007, the power cord is falling out, battery life is very short and the computer gets very hot, causing the fan to run on high.HP will not repair the computer under warranty in the 15th month, even though they repaired the same problem six months ago.I have another HP laptop (dv5000) which had a serious conflict with an HP All In One.","I could probably count on one hand the times it has frozen or crashed during a heavy application.I am looking to purchase a new laptop as I would like something more portable, less hot, and with a longer battery life.","However on the bad news:1) NO GAMING!!...It\u0027s not even worth to install it on this...I\u0027ve tried the \"VERY LOW\" settings in Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth about a year ago but that\u0027s it (Btw, I dunno why but it can\u0027t play that game anymore)...With new PC stores in games now, I would not advise it...Plus the video card is like an Intel GMA or something even lower so I don\u0027t recommend it.2) MY BATTERY DIED!...I should say it\u0027s fortunate that my PC didn\u0027t die...only my laptop external battery die...It doesn\u0027t function anymore...now I always need a nearby power source to turn it on...and the wire isn\u0027t that long anyway..3) IT CAN\u0027T HANDLE WIRELESS N!!! It can\u0027t handle Internet Explorer 6 and Windows Live Messenger together...and these two aren\u0027t even games.","Long battery life (actually get 4 hours)4.","The basic battery is more than a pound and would last hardly an hour.","I wish they\u0027d taken the more conservative look of this dv5t and just improved on it slightly.Other than the laptop running very hot, the pesky left touchpad wearing out early, the battery charge lasting about 2 hours, and the battery failing after just 2 years, I was pretty happy with the overall quality of the DV5.","Battery Life is surprisingly the same as Ibook even if its CPU is upgraded!On the other hand,1.","Have had to replace the battery twice and a week ago, the hard disk died.","Pros: nice price with configs and features, light weight, slim design.Cons: hot on the panel and low battery life.There are three power contrl modes and I used the most power saving one (so the cpu performace is much lower).","First the battery and ac adaper within the first year and HP was utterly no help.","It is very small, but the keyboard is of usable size and has a good feel to it (my old gateway notebook definitely had a bit of a flimsy feel to it).A few things:1) GET THE HIGH CAPACITY BATTERY.","I\u0027m not going to.The main complaints about this computer are that (1) it\u0027s hot, and (2) it has poor battery life.","I say if you\u0027re confident of your computer skills and can take care of the little computer problems yourself, take them out.Overall: Yes, battery life is bad.","I love this computer! I have had it since June of last year, nearly 10 months and will agree that if used at full strength, the battery does poop out rather quickly.","Why would I though - it\u0027s a great computer.Battery life is pretty good - the 6 cell battery is rated at 3.5 hrs and will give you a decent 2.5.","This upgraded Tecra M6 sure show\u0027s its potential! Pros: Solid build quality, excellent screen and keyboard, perfect out of the boxCons: Heavy, so-so battery life, features only \"average\" for the priceSummary: I really liked the keyboard, the feel of the keys being much better than most other low-priced machines, and the screen was very sharp and bright.","This model is also not suspected to the battery recall that has been going on lately, so you can buy in confidence that your battery will not randomly explode.Ventilation is all on the left hand side of the system, (fan blows out the back, however the airflow is pulled from the bottom) so if you are using it on your lap, you will find yourself putting the right side of the computer on your lap.","I added a bright screen-low processor and a dim screen-high processor setting.- Long-lasting battery.- Good wireless.- Durable! I\u0027m a big klutz and dropped it not once, but TWICE from at least 1.5 ft. onto a hardwood floor.","A VERY GOOD NOTEBOOK-LAPTOP, EXCELENT BATTERY LIFE, I DO RECOMEND TO BUY THIS ONE DELL PORTABLE, IS ONE OF THE BESTS A well functioning little machine, maybe for some people some what slow, but I can work it.For the money it is quite good.","Overall, a decent machine for the price, although construction is rather flimsy and the battery absolutely sucks (battery life was poor to begin with, and now a year later no longer works for more than 10 minutes).","(talking about battery it cost only $99 to purchase extra one - other brand clost alomost double the price)4.","Batteries seem to never die, and with a mini-mouse it is awesome.","For all the real estate offered in a 17\" laptop, you\u0027d think there\u0027d be more here offered.-Battery life - Awful.","Battery life is impressive at about 4 hours; in fact I got through 2 hours and 55 minutes of a 3 hour movie before the battery died (screen at 50% brightness).","I bought a 12 cell battery which gets me about 4 and a half hours at full brightness too, however the battery protrudes from the bottom of the laptop and is heavy.","To combat this problem, I adjusted the power save settings by right clicking on the little battery and choosing \"adjust power properties.\"","*my* battery only lasts an hour with light use.","Great screen, battery life, nice keyboard, wireless is perfect.BUTThe CPU will not run faster than 797MHZ on the one I bought, and HP admitted it is a flaw.","The XP-M processor is the counterpart to the Pentium-M and saves battery power.","After a second standard battery had to be replaced I asked for an \u0027extended life\u0027 battery and I\u0027m okay now.- As I\u0027m typing this, the \u0027N\u0027 key on the keyboard seems to sometime need to be hit with extra force to register a stroke.On the positive side, the black paint is not peeling off it, as it was the case with my prior IBM T40-something after 2.5 years of daily use.Do I still like my T60? You betcha but, I\u0027m afraid, this one won\u0027t last for the 4-year current company announced laptop lifecycle.","If you need a second extra 9-cell battery, you\u0027ll probably end up with 5-6 pound in your computer bag, which is more or less the same weight as a normal lightweight laptop!In my own opinion, I think this is a very good laptop for frequent travelers who don\u0027t need to run resource-demanding applications and use optical drive only occasionally.","I have also been very pleased with the battery life.","I only didn\u0027t like some things in it, like it only having an Apple MINI DVI video out, no PCI slot and it does not have the extensive amount of software that you can use with windows.PROS:Just 5.9 pounds for a 14.1\u0026quot; laptopGREAT design2 usb 2.0, firewire802.11g (optional airport extreme card)UP TO 6 HOURS of battery life!

The iBook G4 is an incredible machine, in all aspects.","I tried to recalibrate the battery and it looked like it might solve the problem, but it didn\u0027t.","I wasn\u0027t sure that it was really all that High-Def, but when I watched the trailers for Hitch and Resident Evil 2 on the disc (in the extras), they were also in High-Def, but MUCH clearer and look amazing.Pros:+Very fast Processor T7400 (2.16Ghz x 2, 4MB cache)+2 GB of RAM+Blu-Ray+15.4\" Widescreen with WSXGA+ (1680x1050 resolution)+Light-weight at only 6 lbs and barely a inch thick.+Battery life is over 3 hrs, sometimes 4+ hrs when on max battery save mode+ Barely ever uses the HDD in regular use, has so much RAM it just stores everything there.Cons:-Tons of ACER crap that comes with it (it takes about an hr when you first turn it on, to install of the ACER stuff, it does it automatically)-Hard drive is partitioned into two 80GB FAT32 partitions, which sucks for big files over 4GB, which don\u0027t work, unless you uninstall it and then use the backup DVD you make when it boots to install the drivers and special software.-ATI driver is proprietary and huge! 500+ MB-Speakers are very high pitched, squeaky and poor in comparison to my 8 yr old laptop-Acer website is slow and no drivers on it yet for this laptop-Screen is dark compared to my other 2 laptops, even on highest settings, the screen is only about half as brightI also bought the 3 yr Total Replacement warranty which makes my laptop insured until 2010, when I can upgrade it again.Overall, I am VERY pleased with my purchase.","Light, super fast, comfortable keyboard, ultra bright screen, and over 2-hour long battery life! No wonder this model is often out of stock.","The OS is quite stable and the battery lasts a nice long time for me on here.If you\u0027re a PC user, you\u0027ll find that you\u0027ll have to shift your thinking as to what meta keys (i.e. keys like shift, option, control) you need for a given task, but this is only a minor obstacle.","It\u0027s light and sturdy, it looks great, and the battery lasts forever (I get 4 hours of use even with the performance set at high).","So the battery was depleted quickly.","The battery used to last me over 3 hours (easy), but now since it\u0027s 3 years old it lasts much shorter.The Display is absolutely awesome - just like all Sony displays.MY ONLY COMPLAINT:-more video memory: 8MB is a joke, unless you don\u0027t plan on playing any games, exept for some basic ones.","Most of them will skimp somewhere -- usually the RAM, and often the battery life.The first thing I would say is that Boot Camp does indeed run Windows XP perfectly.","We bumped it one night before bed and woke up to find the computer asleep with a dead battery.","You pay for what you get, and Mac\u0027s are the best.So if you want a laptop that is powerful (it\u0027s my all in one solution), simple to use, great battery life (a good solid 4 hours), reliable and secure, brilliant hi resolution screen, this is what you should go for.FYI, I\u0027m a college student who used to be a Windows power user, and now that I use Mac, I don\u0027t have to worry about spyware and virus\u0027s anymore.","I close the lid and come right back where I was! I know some people take this as a canned motto, but it just works! I tell it to do something and it does it! That\u0027s exactly what I expect out of my computer! Battery life is excellent and the built in Airport Extreme is faster I think that hardwired broadband internet.","TO make it last longer, I take the battery out when the power supply is plugged in.","Battery life is so so without the extended life (150.00) battery, Entirely too much preloaded garbage software that needs to be immediately removed for any real performance out of he machine.","Also, I have to leave it charged up because the person who I got this from sold my a crappy battery.","Good battery life (about 4 hours in my case).","Hint: buy the large double capacity battery in addition to the battery included.","Battery life sucks - there is no other way to put it.","The battery just decided to die.","This baby is a heavy carry \u0026 I\u0027ve burned out more ac adapters \u0026 batteries than I\u0027d like to mention - but this baby is over 5 years old and still going.","Battery life (can be improved; HP take note!)2.","After a year the battery still gets about the same amount of time as it did originally - around two hours under normal use.","For me, however, this is not a problem - I am rarely away from an AC outlet, and having Pentium 2.8 Ghz. speed makes up for the battery life.Secondly, nearly 5 Gb. of hard drive space is used by the recovery partition.","This notebook also packs a lot of power with it\u0027s Pentium 4 processor, which makes it quite loud, however.Some drawbacks:1.)Loud (emabrassing when you are tyring to access wireless at the libary)2.)Poor battery performance (only 2 hours at most)3.)Poor sound system (Definitely get a set of decent speakers and an external sound card if you can afford it.)4.)Only 512 MB RAM.","Oh yea, the battery is a goner too, this also became an issue several months ago.","The 6-cell lithium ion battery that comes with the L2105 only gets me about an hours and twenty minutes of straight use.","Buy the optional, high-capacity battery.","(you can always get the bigger battery also)I have a huge desktop so i wanted a truly mobile laptop, this is it webcam, tablet pc, media player, portable DVD cd mp3 player.","(-;The laptop is nice and quiet except intermittently the cpu fan will come on for no reason.Overall the laptop feels very solid and the only thing I have not really tested are the battery discharge times.The only OS I tested this with is Ubuntu Linux and everything worked out of the box except for the flash card reader; There is supposedly a driver in the works for that.","Even on max battery, I only got about 2 hours battery life.It gets too hot.","The screen is bright and there are no bubbles or discrepancies of any kind, and the fact that the LCD panel is on one giant hinge basically ensures you won\u0027t get a flimsy hinge (common to Dell laptops, with two small hinges positioned at each end of the panel), and the battery is sufficient for small tasks (excel sheets, writing essays, watching movies on a plane, etc).","This is one of the greatest pieces of electronics ever created.Wish there was more hard drive memory, but if you store files online you dont really need all that much hard drive space.I also wish the battery life was better.But other than those two things its a must have.Joel Simkhai It\u0027s a good computer, for sure, but the battery....","After 2 years, the battery just died, can\u0027t recharge it at all.For a pricey model like this should have higher quality.","Performance has been great.Integrated Wireless: Just because I\u0027ve never had an internal wireless before--it\u0027s great and convenient.Cons (I feel a review isn\u0027t a review unless there\u0027s a con or two):Battery - The biggest draw back to this machine, no doubt.","If the power does not grab you, the quality and overall competence of this machine will win you over.Panther (OSX.3) is rock stable, I added memory and am using it for DVD movies and digital imaging which all works perfectly.If I had one complaint it would be that the battery last longer than the 3 1/2 hours I am getting burning this machine up.If you own any small laptop, you would do well to take a look at this baby.","Very poor battery life so if you are planning to use it while on travel ready to spare $300 for a new battery.","It seems as long as you don\u0027t have your wireless turned on...it will do fine going from battery to AC.","The battery life can be improved by turning down the screen brightness, muting the volume, enabling a conservative power scheme, and ensuring that the CPU speed stepping is functioning.","I also got the 9-cell battery which adds some weight and protrudes from the back of the body slightly.","It does run hot, and the battery lasts about 2.5 hours, but the light weight and nice speed and wifi make up for everything.Get yourself a Mareware case designed for the small Apple laptop.","I love the higher screen resolution and the added battery life.","Additionally Sony is proprietary with regards to parts, so it\u0027s hard to find a cheap extended battery.","Secondly, the battery life is not good enough for a truly portable machine (and not even close to many of the other laptops out there).","The dell\u0027s would report 2 hours and once I used Firefox the battery life would drop to 30 minutes.","This, by the way, was extremely weak for the task of holding the battery in the housing.","First off, people on here who criticise this for low battery life are just silly.","After this experience, I will don\u0027t think I will go back to Sony again.PROS:* Stylish looks, all aluminum palm rest (but cheap lid design)* Weights 4lb 3.4oz (I measured it with my postal scale)* Intel Duo Core @ 1.83GHz* 1GB of DDR2 RAM* Huge 120GB HDD (5400RPM)* First dual graphics laptop* GeForce Go 7400 (top of the line \"thin-n-light\" graphics processor from NVIDIA)* Nice little built-it webcam (but very low quality videos and pics)* Very bright screen (but had 3 defective pixels in a row)* Runs very cool and very quiet (even when playing 3D games)* Can play Dungeon Siege II at 1024x768 with medium setting at around 40-60fpsCONS:* Cheap looking lid surface (feels like sand paper)* No locking hinge for LCD screen* Annoying external Wi-Fi antenna (even without GPRS option)* Makes loud-whining noise when playing DVDs with labels (i.e. Memorex, Neato)* Battery jiggles and doesn\u0027t feel secured in place* Huge AC adapter weights exactly 1 pounds and is bigger than Dell\u0027s normal adapter* Battery life is a little disappointing (2h:45m on performance mode and 3h:15m on stamina mode) Let me start with a simple disclaimer, first I worked for Apple (a long time ago) for 11 years, I also worked for Microsoft for 6 years and I\u0027m pretty comfortable in both camps but I truly love Apple for it\u0027s design and combined hardware/software implementations.","Performance is more than adequate when I run Macromedia\u0027s Dreamweaver and Fireworks applications, Microsoft Excel, Word, few browser windows, and Outlook email at the same time.Here are few complains;

It\u0027s big, it\u0027s heavy and with all the extras of COURSE the battery won\u0027t last hours and hours.","It was delivery on time and with the quality I expectThanks It was good, but the image of the laptop online is a little different because it doesnt have the finger print log in. then, it was ok it was great laptop, its display is very good-bright,vibrant, and rich colours, but the battery back up is not too great, It was the better chance, it\u0027s light and everything work properly.","I notice that the best time to recharge a near empty battery is when the computer is either turned off or asleep.","The battery, remember it only lasts 1 hr.","I guess upgrading the battery would also help.There\u0027s more to discover on this little machine (not yet tried the DVD multi drive burner for eg) but all I can say at this point is: Wow! Great low price laptop, display is very good and everything worked well out of the box.","I did check with the serial numbers on Mac.com to see if mine is one of those defected batteries, but it is not.","The battery life isn\u0027t bad, nor is it great - surfing the net and word processing, I\u0027ve managed a bit over four hours.","Despite being in a neoprene rubber protective case, it was damaged so badly that repairing would cost the same as a new Macbook.So after some nagging, the insurance ponied up for a new Macbook rather than repairing the Pro.I bought the White 2.2GHz model but with custom RAM (2 GB) and hard drive (250 GB), plus AppleCare, via the Apple Educational store.First impressions:- battery life is astonishing.","#2 - the battery would not charge, as clearly shown by the indicator light.","I got used to my old Gateway that gave me 4 hours of battery life.","It\u0027s the only laptop that allows you to switch between two graphic cards (integrated intel chip and Nvidia for performance) so user can optimizie the battery life or the performance based on their needs.","The first one lasted about 3 weeks before the battery swelled to the point that it made the trackpad inoperable.","Long battery life, fast, and reasonably priced.","It boots up with a decent speed has three USB ports that I found most useful.I almost always use it on the AC adapter, so the battery life is not important to me.","And one of the best parts? The life of the battery puts my former Dell computers to absolute shame!I had ordered another Dell with the VISTA operating system a couple of months ago.","It\u0027s been at the repair shop (continuously) since April 7th.Why would you want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars, as I did, on a laptop that won\u0027t run on battery, that is too hot to hold in your lap, that suddenly turns off and loses all your data, and THEN, on TOP of that, after you have been patient and been without your new laptop for MONTHS, get all sorts of rude crap from their Customer Service (ha! what an oxymoron that is!)?

(also faster with new mobile core duo chip and longer battery life - 7.5hrs) but also \u003e$2000.","Overall I think this is going to be a long-lasting machine.In short, if you are looking for an ultra-portable that has a beautiful screen, good battery life, and doesn\u0027t cost an arm and a leg, this is for you.","And this one has a removable battery which allowed me to charge 2-3 batteries for road trips and just pop them in as I went through them.","Has anyone else tried running the laptop on AC power alone and the battery removed - and still have the blank screen problem?Update: Well it just crashed again.","Also test how long the batteries last once its fully charged.","Plan on upgrading the battery - the standard 6-cell is weak.","I have a new mini tower desktop (dual core Pentium) that sits 2 feet from me yet I can hear this laptop over it even though it is on a docking station at least 6 feet away.The only redeeming aspect is the fact that if you set it to max power saving mode and run it on the battery the fan will actually shut off - as long as you don\u0027t do anything more than simple word processing.","It does get warm but that isnt a real big issue with me...as far as battery life it doesnt seem to be the greatest, in my case it isnt a problem because I intend on having my charger with me.","I think it is Windows Media player issue.7)IE stops accepting mouse input sometimes, only way out is to restart IE.8)Mouse key is hard and noisy.With all these I would say it is still excellent overall, barring battery life.","When you sit there with it blowing hot air on your leg, trying to balance it in a way that lets the air keep moving, you think it is \"what were they smoking\" stupid.They crammed everything into the machine, but could have done a lot better in designing the ergonomics, weight, heat and battery life.","(Hint: Freezing a notebook battery on a Dell may trigger manufacturer mode temporarily, and most likely won\u0027t fix a battery whose life has truly and really ended.)","Since then I\u0027ve had nothing but problems.Continuous overheating and shutdowns, the cd/dvd rom stoppedworking, the screen broke, the battery never works for morethan ten minutes even if it\u0027s fully charged.","The biggest draw back is the short battery life of the 6 cell battery which is only 2 hours.","I\u0027ve only had two draw backs so far, one is the battery life is only about 2 hrs and about 1.2 with DVD.","About the heat, It\u0027s not a problem, I work a lot of hours with no problems, well only when you put a CD/DVD it makes a lot of noise, but that is because the quality of the disc.I have to problem with my VAIO, when I make a clean format I have problems to find some drivers, but after that It works very well.So, if you like the big screen and the better quality in image and design, Buy a VAIO AR Series...!GrettingsJC - From Per\u0026uacute; I Have nearly the exact same laptop, mine instead has only 3 gigs Ram, and the Intel Core 2 Duo t9300 which is the newer penryn 45 nano meter processors, the processor in the displayed laptop is the 65nm cpu, smaller cpu\u0027s offer longer battery life by using less electricity, in using less electricity it produces less heat.","I love it execpt that the battery doesn\u0027t last long.","This is unlike the Sharp MM20 which sacrifices speed for long battery life, or the X505 which costs two arms and two legs.If Sony can address the keyboard issues this would be the perfect laptop for all my mobile needs.","I just did typical web surfing and after about 2.5 hrs the fully charged battery ran out.The panel feels pretty warm.","- Short battery life is a problem out of the box.","The battery on the VAIO is also a let down, you can get up to almost 5 hrs sometimes, but that\u0027s if you screen is as dark as possible have volume low and don\u0027t do much with the computer, otherwise you can get around 2.5-3 hours if set to what people want to use it at.The screen is awesome, very crisp and full, but it gets dirty incredibly fast.","BUT, the batteries recharge very quickly.","I usually have it plugged in anyway so it\u0027s not a big deal for me, but I used it for a while last night running on the battery just to test out the life.","It is light, bright and clean! At just over 4 lbs its light, and 1 lb of that is the battery.Speaking of the battery, it is a wonder.","It took quite a while before I could wear the battery out!

I think just a couple of hours - which may be a problem for some.","The battery life suffers, of course, but you can see the performance boost.5.","Unfortunately the performance goes down dramatically but at least you get pretty good battery life.So if you\u0027re going to buy one of these get the big battery and a set of earplugs.","I\u0027ll probably get a second battery which is something I have considered but never got around to doing.~eddie I had to come back and correct my review of this laptop.","The battery is almost as good as those currently used by Apple, and it heats up to the same degree as my recent Macbook (but much less than the old Powerbook).","If you need a good laptop, go with this, if you dont mind battery life :) I have had this laptop for about a year now and I love it.","SO EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO SEND THIS AS A GIFT AND IT WORKED MAYBE AN HOUR AND DIED....THEIR GOING TO REPLACE IT OR THE BATTERY OR WHATEVER IT IS WHICH IAM PLEASED ....BUT I JUST WISH IT WOULD HAVE WORKED ...I BOUGHT IT AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER SHE WAS SO SURPRISED...WELL ANY WAY HOPEFULLY SHE GETS IT RETURNED IN TIME BEFORE THE WARRANTY DIES ....","Like another reviewer pointed out the battery runs out even on the balanced mode.","When you finish calibrating the battery the way they say, you\u0027re ready to have fun.","I have 2 IBM batteries, and they usually only last 45-60 minutes on the airplane.","The only thing more I could ask for is longer battery life.","The battery could last a little longer, and 512 ram isn\u0027t enough to do much when the video takes 128 of it.","And movies are a joy to watch on this screen.The weight, at about 7 lbs with the battery, isn\u0027t the lightest laptop around, but when compared to the near 10 lbs of the Toshiba, is quite easy to get used to.","A few months after I had it the battery circuit and the motherboard crashed.","If you can deal with the battery problem it would take care of you.","I have put up some more $$$ to get the larger battery, still what I got is about 7 hrs or less.","They replaced EVERY material in construction for the better, improved battery life, and it is much faster.","It DID get very hot from use and the battery life was very very short.","The system is fast, and the battery litterally lasts four-plus hours unlike my other laptops which lasted 40 minutes to an hour.","The battery life is terrible (1 hour max), and the case now has a small crack in it from the extreme heat it builds up.","The power management works great (excellent battery life and fantastic standby/resume reliability).","All I can say is \"wow\".So the good parts are that the system runs for a long time (4.5 - 5hrs measured) on the extended capacity battery.","Small, ultra portable, awesome screen.Hook it to your belt and go.Like everybody else says, the extended battery is a must.I use mine with Sprint\u0027s wireless usb card, just like broadband at home.","Being that I just paid $150. for a new longer life battery for this laptop I am actually online looking into the cost of another Toshiba M45-s265 for when this one dies on me, i will have an extra battery to use for it as well.","I have read about other people having wireless/battery lockup problems.","Another disappointment for me was its very short battery life (lasted less than 90 Mins on average for me).","Rugged enough and capable with some forgiveness in it\u0027s surfaces, this would be a respected business machine.The only issue I have is with the 6-cell battery, where the HP makes the 3-5 hour 12-cell battery available as a convenient extra: Nice marketing, but as the laptop purchaser who knows how long a notebook really lasts in the world, I\u0027m not amused.","Within a few weeks of this happening, the entire battery failed and wouldn\u0027t take a charge.","The keyboard is a great size for typing, the screen is nice and bright, and I love the battery life I\u0027m getting.","It also has an extremely comfortable keyboard.The only bad news was the short battery life.","Even so battery life has been over 3-1/2 hours when hitting it HARD -

Honestly, not much.","However there definetly are some things I do not like- it gets very hott- the mooing noise of the fans can get VERY annoying- battery life w/wireless on is only around 3 hrs- 512 RAM is not enough- 60 gig is not enoughFor the same price in a pc laptop you could get a laptop that is probably faster and has around a 100 gig hard drive.","(The battery life stinks when playing games though - I only got about one hour when playing NFS III)*Screen Size:The screen is huge - almost as big as a 17\" CRT monitor.","That connection would invariably disconnect from time to time during use, and I\u0027d be on battery power without realizing it.","Of course we would all like more speed...but that comes with a price - more speed\u003dhigher temperatures, and less battery efficiency.","Pros:Screen Color, SpeakersCons:It\u0027s really too hot to be a \"Lap\" top!

I highly recommend getting the 60GB hard drive and at least 512MB of RAM.","Excellent purchase - I was looking for a lightweight computer with good battery life, a large memory and optical drive.","But in comparison it is almost amazing how much more thinking went into its design, things you easily take for granted if you have one and you may not miss if you never used a better designed laptop.Then, if you rarely depend on battery power and keep the AV on a table, preferably without closing the lid (and maybe some external speakers), it proabaly will serve you well.","You can order one from ACER that will give you 2-3 hours of running time for under $150, or buy an external extra 1-2 hour, battery pack that plugs right into the AC adapter jack for under $100.I bought this as an extra back-up XP machine for my work.","It runs very quietly as well.- The battery life is quite impressive (my average \u003d 6 hours).","I am not experiencing a short battery life as other users mentioned, it seems more than adequate (I do turn down screen brightness to get more time out of it).","Maybe the battery life is a good thing, if it lived to 5 hours maybe the MB would have melted long ago.It\u0027s very light, it\u0027s very small and it\u0027s inexpensive for its class.If you get it and after a week of banging on it hard you hate it, get your money back but if you open it and see no dead pixels and you find it does what you need an UltraLight to be then what\u0027s the fuss at the price?And if you, like me, get over a year out of it then you\u0027re ahead of the game for a notebook purchase from any vendor.","the main drawbacks of this system are low battery and very high heat.","The screen is bright and sharp, the battery life is solid, Though I typically use it near places where I can just plug in.","Email support was good, but phone-based customer service (primarily to collect credit card info from me to make sure I returned the defective batteries after being sent a replacement) was terrible, the Indian customer support could not get timezones straight to contact me, and I could not contact them directly.","If you want to extend you battery life learn your laptop and how to set up a Roaming profile to turn off all the extra\u0027s your not using when you travel like the wireless or bluetooth.","Battery life is average I recently bought an apple powerbook laptop 12\",that was listed as used but in very good condition.I was concerned about making a purchase like this from an unknown seller that seemed to be new to the site-but I trusted the Amazon site.The price was really good and the description impressive;so although I knew very little about the item I decided to risk it.I had been using a dell for about 4 or 5 years;the last 2 or 3 of which were computer hell.And I had been vowing to next time get a mac since I heard they were less aggravating in regards to things like freezing up for no reason,bogus error messages that I couldn\u0027t possibly understand,e-mail that wouldn\u0027t open for 5 minutes \u0026 then didn\u0027t like to receive or send mail some days,15minute boot-ups,and web pages(when I finally got on) that got stuck when I tried to scroll.Well, needless to say I am ecstatic! Everything actually does what you tell it to and almost instantaneously.I have made the adjustments without all that much hassle.Thought I might mind the smaller screen but not at all.Within the first week-I had done mail,gone on the internet,installed my mouse,the font I wanted,had it reading stuff for me,installed games,have it tell me the time etc etc etc.It is that user friendly.There is just too much to love about it to even list.I would NEVER go back to any other pc again!I am in computer heaven!

I ran into a bump with the product its self(battery was no good)i am currently working on getting one...is on the way not at my expense...","How will someone know this if it isn\u0027t in the boxed documentation? Nevertheless, I calibrated the battery twice and got 41 minutes battery life in my tests following calibration.2.","It gets 4 stars due to the fact that it was a hassle for me to get a battery to begin with.","I won\u0027t go over the minute details, but basically it was in for repairs at least 5-6 times to replace the battery, hard drive, random reboot issue, discoloration on the plastic, SuperDrive, etc.The last issue I had was just two days ago.","Just bought the Toshiba M35-S359 after much debate and research on which laptop will best benefit needs of wireless connectivity and good processing power without being penalized by the short battery charges of many laptops.","To-date the battery life has been better than my previous model as well.","The battery last for about an hour.","Sony has a battery with 50% longer life for another $400.","They will not send me a replacement/exchange CD for their mistake.I decided to go ahead and buy all the software my self and its working fine except that it still overheat and Battery life has gone down to 12 min???I am looking forward to sell it and buy a good laptop with nice review.","i bought mine a year and a half ago..cons:my battery lasts only 10minutes sometimes less..! and even the newest versions come with the same type of battery.","Just remember: the battery life has limitations, the keyboard is not nearly as solid feeling as Dell\u0027s and HP\u0027s (but is nicely sized), and the appearance is pretty \u0027square\u0027 in all respects.","It wasn\u0027t for another year, until Vista\u0027s first Service Pack came out did I get the router get secured, and it turned out that it was Vista, not the router, the whole time.The more recent issues I\u0027ve had with it are the battery life.","The second complaint is the battery life is almost nil for the lenth I need to use this computer for school.","As usual, Sony makes the upcharge for another battery or larger capacity battery abusely expensive.","I charge and drain the battery daily, so it gets a good five hours of daily use.","Connect your printer, camera and other gadgets with ease.- Amazing sound quality.- Microphone and Headphone ports at the front.- Warehouse scale hard disk at 120Gb of space!- Burn DVDs and CDs easily.- Very clear, high resolution webcam.- It looks smart.- Battery time is 3+ hours.- Has all the other essential ports such as Network, Firewire etc.Bad:- Gets a little warm during use.","I just have the standard battery and it lasted as long as I needed it to on the long plane trips.","Hey people,This is Arpitha and i bought this laptop a month ago and it is great......sleek,light weight,i like it........got it for a good deal and i recommend this to everyone who wants a good and wonderful laptop.Only drawback is that the battery gets heat up very soon so..........be careful...........","The first one had defective battery and I returned it.","Battery life is only 2.5hrs.","Two hour battery life.You buy a tablet PC to be portable.","i don\u0027t even carry a bag any more.you will need the large battery if you plan on working during your flights.","It is supposed to be portable but the battery life is so poor that you have to be near mains power.","First, it loads programs faster, heats way lower than the Toshiba and battery lasts one more hour...I would recommend this laptop to anyone....","Occasionally the feature intended to run a DVD without turning on the hard drive (very handy) would freeze up, but other than that, wonderful! Good battery life, good graphics, nice screen, handy remote, pretty good speakers, nice keyboard, held up well when transported, and not too heavy.","The speedup of operations with both the SSD and RAM upgrade are almost frighteningly effective.The Battery life is so-so.","Then the powercord caught on fire! Hmmm...I had to go through applecare for that and they eventually believed me that I didnt do it from negligence and replaced that.Now, in just a few months my battery is once again faulty and wont hold a charge.","The battery power is such a problem that one third of the reviews on Circuit City\u0027s site complain about it.","Battery life is pretty good though, if you\u0027re using programs resident on the hard drive.","You can always upgrade to a 9 cell battery and/or take out the DVD-burner and stick in an extra battery there.Opening up the T60 is also easy, and allowable under the warranty to some extent - for example, adding RAM or replacing the keyboard (replacement keyboards are shipped overnight!)I also like the matte-ish finish off the laptop cover as well as the screen.","The laptop battery life is perfectly fine (2-3 hours) and it\u0027s held up very well including playing DVD\u0027s for many hours on long flights (using an airplane DC attachment).","It\u0027s incredibly poor quality, and because it\u0027s a usb powered camera, it runs afoul of the duo core usb-bug issue that causes your battery to drain faster than it should.","For a seasoned PC pro, this shouldn\u0027t be a problem.Now the cons: Weight... 7.8 pounds with battery.","As promised, the screen was superb, it has a very sleek look and the battery lasted longer than my previous laptop, which I was very pleased about.","Unlike the Compaq I mentioned before, in which XP would switch to the battery settings, dimming the screen and slowing it down (and even when I set it to maximum performance it still seemed slower) everything stays the same.","Pros:-Very Powerful computer, handles anything-Large 15.4\" screen-3 USB ports, media reader slot, DVD burner-Great computer for the moneyCons:-Short battery life, sometimes less than an hour-I have a thin cyan line that runs down the screen for some reason, but it goes away if you tilt the screen-Wireless signal isn\u0027t as strong as other computers in the same house-Fairly heavy, big dimensions, and short battery life prevent it from being truly mobile Pros: Webcam, Fingerprint Reader, Remote control, TouchScreen, Microphone, 7 media buttons.cons: Speakers, Battery life, Heat GenerationThis gadget has been behaving good for 2 months and very recently it started making a stuttering static noise if I change the lid position.","I\u0027ve also noticed that from time to time my screen momentarily goes blank, but my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack thereof.","Sony is most notable for their S and SZ series notebooks (13.3\" Screen), or their ultraportable T and TX series, so the FS series kind of has a lack of flare in comparison.PROS:-VERY CRISP screen with 1280x800 native resolution-Great number of ports on connections, including memory card reader-Very portable-Great pricing-Pentium M-Dual Layer DVD Burner-Battery Life is better than Toshiba\u0027s (I got 2.13hours... manufacturer claims 3 hours, but I had it with max brightness and Wi-Fi, so that\u0027s pretty good... 25% more battery)-100GB Hard DriveCONS:-Outdated processor, as well as not even top of the line-Only 512MB of RAM, and not even the fastest (only 533MHz... they make 667MHz)-Graphics Media Accelerator - uncommon in Sony notebooks, but not good for anything more than causal use nonetheless - GMA\u0027s use shared memory for its virtual memory, so you could get as low was 384MB of RAM remaining if the GMA kicks in.-Useless Sony programs - Sony has terrible program interfaces, erase them once you set up everything else on your computer-XP Home - You don\u0027t have much RAM, and now you\u0027ll have lots of spyware filling it up-Heavier than it looks - I weights roughly 6lbs, but judging by how thin it is, I would\u0027ve guessed closer to 5lbs.BOTTOM LINE: A step up from some of Dell and HP\u0027s buttom of the line notebooks with 40GB hard drives and 256MB or RAM, but not enough to justify a purchase, unless you want the mobile experience with the Sony name.","After downloading the user manual from the Averatec website, I found out that this laptop has a button (above the regular keyboard) that you have to push to activate the internal wireless connection, probably to help save battery power.","It could have a longer battery life, but I think that the battery is average when compared to DELL and others laptops I have seen.The wireless card is a great feature.The cd burner is very easy to use.I have used it to watch DVDs, and I thought the picture was sharp.","I tried very hard to stick with my three-year old Dell until its battery got totaled.","Great for watching DVDs on road trips (although you\u0027ll need a DC adapter, the battery won\u0027t last for a full movie).","You can get good 3rd party batteries for less than $40 that do not have this issue.Currently I own a Mac Pro with 4TB Raided internal Hard drive space (4 2TB hard drives), 14 GB 1066 MHz DDR3 RAM, 2 x 2.93 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon processor (8 core model), ATI Radeon HD 4870 512 MB graphics card, a 1920 x 1080 HD monitor, with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74).","I cannot watch a DVD film on it using battery power.","Don\u0027t expect some awesome machine though; it\u0027s a dinosaur!PS -

You are going to see it a lot.- It is not unusual that the curser just freezes or disappears altogether while the processor is \u0027thinking about some trivial action or other\u0027.- It frequently loses the wireless signal requiring a restart, even though the wireless is fully operational- iCal and Address book are a poor copy of outlook and unfortunately do not work as well (I am no lover of Microsoft, but you have got to say it how you see it).- The \u0027Finder\u0027 is a second rate Windows Explore functionality that is cumbersome to use and either doesn\u0027t respond to mouse clicks or is overly sensitive, so when trying to change the name of a document it will open it instead - repeatedly!- I have also lost count of the number of times during a day when an application spontaneously closes.- After a couple of years the battery power would just deplete; the status bar could be as high as 50% but then BLANK! nothing - all power gone.","They other day I installed software using the CD drive and had it in \"maximum performance\" and still the battery lasted for about 3 hours.The option of adjusting the energy consumption through processor performance is great, so you can set it to \"low consumption\" if you are doing internet only or \"high performance\" if you are doing heavier stuff.","You get everything you could possibly want in the way of connections and options - double USB, Firewire, PS/2, built-in modem and NIC, docking option, and with the two optical drives plus the drive bay battery you\u0027re really set to configure yourself for anything.This is *not* a Vaio killer - it has the heft of an old fashion laptop, but with that comes a sense that it\u0027ll last through a few hundred flights and being thrown around the office.","The glossy finish does fingerprint and smudge easy but just as easy, a damp cloth returns it back to brand new with minimal effort.The ONLY thing that I don\u0027t like about this laptop is the battery life.","It still worked fine but the shock did break something that connected the power supply and I had trouble charging the battery after that.","Also, if apple can create a computer like this, they can definitely make a longer battery.","It wasn\u0027t until I removed the battery and then reinserted it that the computer booted back up.","Of course, spinning the optical drive - like watching movies will make it go shorter but this is one of the mega-size LiMh batteries - 7200 mA.","I have attached an external keyboard for now (till I figure out how to open it and see what the problem is), so it is working like a desktop for me..Other problems are of course the poor battery life, the difficulty in clicking the keyboard mouse keys, the time taken to connect to a wireless network, and of course the heavy weight.I would never recommend Sony Vaio to my friends and colleagues.Maybe we can initiate some action against Sony if there is a generic problem with their keyboard on Vaios? Just love the MacBook.","when i replug the power while i\u0027m working, the battery never seems to recharge past the percentage it was at when i turned it on.plus now that apple is using intel chips, the computer runs hotter than before.","You get the unit, a charger, a battery, a wrist strap (that also works as a handle, very clever) and a cheap (poor quality) case.","The battery life for the Macbook Pro is pretty good.","I have just one thing to say about my Toshiba Satellite, and I presume this extends to all of Toshiba\u0027s laptops: the battery is worthless.",":-(The battery keeps the same life today (approx 2 hours) as it did a year ago.","Very light with almost 3 hours of battery life if you plan to move a lot with it.","Luckily after numerous calls to Sony they sent me a new battery, but it took three calls.","The batteries are only $99, so I got a spare one for long trips.","Sony certainly wasn\u0027t kidding when they called it a desktop replacement as it will spend most of its life on your desktop unless you want to strain a few vertebra trying to carry it around (9-11 lbs incl. battery, but no accessories etc in that weight).","WOW \"windows\" on a Mac? Other computers beware! If you want a computer that is going to last 5 hours battery time, music, DVD\u0027s used, work, JUST WORK, and is ready to go out the box, use the \"Macbook\" from Apple.","Battery seems to recharge very slowly if computer is in use.","So did more digging online and was amazed at how many people with the Nvidia GPU laptops was having a HIGH failure rate (HP so called band aid fix was to release a new bios that kept the Fan runnign on the laptop which drains the battery life so fast it is not funny).There is now a Lawsuit against Nvidia and HP on the know failure rate of the GPU.","It\u0027s large, heavy, hot and has crappy battery life.","The Mac starts up fast and runs relatively flawlessly while in use - no crashing, etc.But, what\u0027s the point of owning a laptop with a dead battery?

I get about 2 hours from my battery if it isn\u0027t plugged in.","You would think that this portability would equate to a downsized computer something with a weaker processor or smaller screen to conserve battery life but just the opposite is true.","That way you have a great computer and insurance.For those of you who are leary of Compaq computers because of the particular battery quirk with the Evo.","Love it...OK so that\u0027s two .....It was not a hard sell, I have been a fan for the whole of my computer life, learning the skill on the very first one,but this little machine ticks all the boxes and comes all ready to go....Very clear screen resolutions....wish the battery lasted longer! Love it.","Everything runs well and looks nice, but I\u0027m trying to find some more accessories for it, including an extra battery (mind you, it dies in less than 2 hours).","I love this machine, You should know that the TV receiver can only be used without the battery, (the module goes in that bay) so you MUST be plugged to an outlet.","I may purchase a 12 cell battery and see how many hours that will last.","The plus point is that I am then able to disable all network hardware and that gives battery life a little help as well.All I wanted was a lightweight second system with a widescreen that would allow me to work with multiple windows.","The power jack is not fastened down properly and the soldering eventually melts away, which makes it impossible to charge up the battery.","With Duo Core Intel FAST processors, 256MB Dedicated Video, large 100+GB Hard Drive (5400RPM - fast for laptops), beautiful high resolution easy to view screen and a sleek package UNDER 4 Pounds!! - this is a system capable of video editing, presentations or anything you might want to do....and yes still smaller than a piece of paper :) HIGHLY Suggest the purchase, it has been extremely reliable with the small exception of the battery which SONY replaced under warranty.","The battery life is outstanding, the processor is incredibly fast, and if you get a solid state hard drive the thing is indestructible.","I have compared my reception to my girlfriend\u0027s Dell, and where she gets 5 full bars, I get 4 and sometimes oscillates between 3 and 4.The battery on my PowerBook was also dead on arrival when I received it.","The Laptop rests nicely on the 12 cell battery and puts it on a slight incline shich is nice and good for cooling.","The only problem is that the battery doesn\u0027t hold a charge very long, whether being used or not.There are no scratches and just one very small dent in the case.","It takes a loooong time to calibrate, but it\u0027s a good way to keep your battery alive longer.Speaking of calibration, make sure you also calibrate the fan.","The screen is sharp and impressive, the battery life is good (not quite the 6 hours advertised, but a solid 4-4.5 hours), its incredibly portable, the full-size keyboard is easy to use, and I\u0027ve easily integrated the iBook at home for the full desktop experience with a regular monitor, wireless mouse, and external drive (to make up for the small hard drive).Having to buy Microsoft Office was definitely a negative of the iBook, but it was definitely worth the extra cost.","Next I tested the battery life.","I\u0027m running this guy on AC power right now because the original battery only died about a month ago.","I found that sony\u0027s Lithium battery go all ways deep and you can\u0027t really crack it.","I use it many hours every day, travel with it regularly, work at home and at various coffee shops, etc.The screen is excellent - and plenty bright even on battery.","I walked in, told them what was up, and no questions asked, \"Ok here\u0027s your new battery!\" and I walked out.","I prefer Max Battery.","I have had no problems or issues with it, except for the Vista (which is pretty widely hated) and the battery life, which is usually only about 2 hours.","Laptop still runs great on \"shore-power\" just fine.Replacement battery cost\u0027s more than laptop is worth; lol.It has been great for what I use it for.If you can find one for around $100 , you won\u0027t be dissapointed.","Its two major drawbacks are battery life (I will be buying a 12 cell backup) and a cd tray which appears to be rather delicate.","The laptop came with a decent battery and was practically blemish free.","It\u0027s so sad that Toshiba has tried to obviously cut costs in their casing and Keyboard costs, which makes an otherwise superior product feel and look sub par and clunky.The battery life is short, but that is given to you in the specs.","It\u0027s a powerful little PC with a lot built in... again, just consider how much battery life you need.","I ended up splicing the original charger cord together and back in business!The battery lasts for about 50 mins. but I dont have a need for that as I am always near a outlet.No overheating at all.","Battery life is very good (it is close to as advertised).","I sent mine in for a broken battery latch.","Will get an aftermarket battery this time and get the 8 hour version.The finish on the laptop has been good and durable, except for the trackpad.","(Passowrd logins, launching applications using different fingerprints ... yes, you can actually give Outlook the middle finger !! No pun intended.)Apart from the battery life, which is only about 3 hrs - (fine by me); everything else works to spec.The best feature, which is somewhat hidden, is a dual display feature of the graphics card in the system - which means, if you connect an external monitor, you can use use the laptop display combined with the external display as an extended desktop.Screen is clear and images are really nice, haven\u0027t used the Ilink port so far.","The battery life was for only about an hour, but it said that in the product specs, so I wasn\u0027t worried about it.I would imagine that there are plenty of people who have purchased this laptop and are perfectly happy with it who haven\u0027t left a review.","Thanks! I\u0027ve been mostly ok with this laptop until recently, but there are a few problems that I must mention:1) The battery life is horrible.","Two important features for me have been; its light weight and very good battery life (up to 8 hours plus).","In the morning I opened my mac to find the battery had not charged.Called Apple Care and opened a ticket.","This is just lame.- If laptop goes on standby because of low battery and you charge it and bring it out later, it cannot reconnect to the internet.","There have been several battery recalls in the past for heat problems (the Apple batteries with the same problems were apparently manufactured by Sony), but i did not have this problem (just ridiculous heat that seemed dangerous but never started a fire).The machine was so hot in general use (GENERAL USE) that it was uncomfortable on my lap.","I bought this laptop back in March 2007; let\u0027s just say, whoever decided to load Vista on these things with 512 MB of RAM ought to be taken back to the woodshed! After a few modifications (dump Vista for XP, then later Windows 7; max out the board with 2GB of RAM; replace the 80GB, 5400 RPM hard with 250GB, 7200 RPM one; replacing the battery with a long-life battery--10 hours versus 2 on a charge), it runs pretty decent.","Armed with the new battery, the Gateway 200X lasted nearly 4 hours.","Pros: Excellent colors, very good performanceCons: Battery life not as long as listed,affordable good quality product.","Other than that, nice little machine, lightweight, super fast, good battery life (had mine running for about 3 hours at max performance).","Battery life could be longer but the power management software provided by Toshiba gives you a decent amount of time on battery power...but gettin a compliant battery that has more cells should fix that.","It does not even compare with the HP Xbrite, Toshiba Trubrite, and Gateway Ultrabrite.The negative aspects are the standard battery that comes with the machine that only lasts about 2 hours and the weak graphic card and integrated speakers (but, if you use earphones you get a better experience).The best reason I like this computer personally is because I got a great deal at Office Depot for less than $699 on a weekly special.","I was able to play about an hour of an HD DVD while hooked up to my Sony LCD TV on battery power without a glitch.It is big and heavy, BUT the weight is well distributed so it feels much lighter than many laptops this big.The screen is bright and the perfect contrast (for me).All in all I love it and I\u0027m not easy to please! I\u0027ve had this for about four or five monts.","(It gives information about Current Power Source, Remaining Battery and Power Profile)2.","To have an idea you can watch the full Titanic movie (that\u0027s over 3 hours and 15 minutes) and still have some battery left!The new 1.2 GHz proc. hasten the timing your apps will load compared to the previus model but you still should upgrade the memory to at least 512 to make good use of Panther without any hassles.The best feature of all is the built-in Airport Card (a $79 value) meaning that you\u0027re online wherever you happen to find a hotspot right from the moment you take it out of the box.","Bad Bad Bad Batery life only last maybe an hour and another battery costs 245.00 so this isn\u0027t for travelers.","A rechargeable lithiom ion battery lasts along time.","The battery barely lasts 2 hrs.","But for 95% of what people do on laptops, this thing ROCKS!

Third, what good is a laptop if you can\u0027t use it for the most basic use of all! TYPING! It didn\u0027t seem to be a hardware problem, the keyboard appeared ok and non-sticky, but when I would open a text file and type, \"Mary went to the store.\"","Most importantly, the battery lasts the full three hours as promised in the manual.","Although that\u0027s not bad, it would be great if I could swap the CD/DVD drive for a 2nd battery.","Cleaning with compressed air generally sorts that out.Yes, it has poor battery life.","For long period of use, I find my shoulder and eyes screaming for help ... 1) Poor quality material2) Very heavy3) Too much of heat produced4) Tooooooo Pricy5) Just 512MB RAM for such high price? 1st, battery life is about 2+ hours at the max which is average.","The extended battery fits with no problem.Needs work40G hard drive is about 6 or 8 gigs free when it arrives.","The battery only lasts 30-45 minutes without plugging in if you are using Wi-Fi, big drawback.","FINALLY I LEFT IT ON AND THE BATTERY DIED AND IT TURNED OFF. fOR THE NEXT WEEK I WAS SO BUMMED AS IT WOULD NOT TURN ON AT ALL!!!!EVEN CONNECTED.","My second gripe is the horrible battery life.","NEC did a good job with this one! With the improved battery life, the USB slave port, the flash ROM, OS, and the 400mhz processor NEC surely made a seller! Many people do not realize that this unit is not running Windows XP, so this unit can out speed most laptops with its operating system!People need to actually give HPC devices an honest chance, and with the right expectations.","i don\u0027t think 5-real life hours is impossible with the additional use of lithium polymer batteries to fill up any extra space inside (like the iPod battery) Also, the screen, when closed, is a wee bit wobbly.","When used with power-saving mode, the battery can last 3+ four hours!Really, nearly everything about this laptop is great.","The battery life runs just under 4 hours at this point and the memory seems more than adaquate.","I prefer to keep the screen on low light, which explains the longer battery life.","From day one the battery was problematic.","My husband\u0027s Toshiba also had Vista and was bought some time in 07 but was much quicker (though it overheated easily).More importantly, there is some wiring glitch b/c after a few months of working well, it stopped recognizing that it was plugged in and quickly ran out of battery before I could figure out what was wrong.","That thing is so delicate, If you try to move the lid of the box, it will break.In any case, looks like the notebook and everything that comes with it new (battery, charger, etc.), so I am OK.The notebook seems to work fine.","I havent used the lightscribe stuff yet, but my friends have lightscribe burners and they love it.Finally, they lie about the battery capacity.","A year and a half of use and it is stable, the display is fine, the battery life is nothing special.If you need to record audio, you\u0027ll be surprised: the only input is MONO!This computer spends more time in hourglass mode or stuck with the hard drive spinning than I\u0027d like.","It\u0027s the same with low battery status, where it doesn\u0027t fall below 9%.","I bot it used and it was time for a new battery so I got one of them too from a place in the Amazon.","With both upgrades installed, this laptop performs flawlessly, without a single complain running intensive CPU and 3D applications, like 3D Studio Max, Lightwave 3D and e-Frontier Poser.In my personal setting, I use in the road my A45 with 2 external USB drives (160 Gb each) and a trackball, getting 2 hours of battery life (up to 3 without them).","And additional battery is so expensive...","The keyboard *is* small, but why order a 12-inch laptop if you\u0027re only going to whine and moan about the size of the keyboard? Sure, it\u0027d be nice if the battery lasted forever, but this isn\u0027t an iBook; you\u0027re getting twice the computing power for less money, so some sacrifices become necessary.","For the next 9 months or so I let it sit and it fully discharged on its own like a rechargable battery usually does.","The sound is also top-rate, excellent stereo separation, which I was surprised to hear on most commercials when I started using my above-mentioned USB TV tuner, which I will review separately (mini- review \u003d excellent).The weight is perfect for carrying around constantly for whatever use you may think of, this laptop is really an all-around jack of all trades.Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the short battery life.","(But this is only really nessesary if you have many applications open at the same time)As for the battery life...","And it\u0027s not so much about the heat but it feels like there is an electro-magnetic charge around that area which makes any body part close to it hurt.I have noticed that on other models that the battery is underneath the keypad so it doesn\u0027t cause the same problem.","Also, the battery life is amazing! I have been able to use it for up to 10 hrs.I used to think I wouldn\u0027t be able to work with a resolution lower than SXGA+, but it took me only a few days to get used to this laptop\u0027s resolution.","The computer\u0027s old so the battery doesn\u0027t really hold a charge.","Extra battery costs $150+tax at Best Buy or Circuit City.","I now routinely get over 3 hours on my battery, 1 year after purchase, and the fan rarely comes on.","As a upcoming freshman, I was looking for a powerful laptop with Centrino, but one that was lightweight and with good battery life.","The battery problem was not fixable - It is simply defective.","Everything works great!The Athlon XP-M processor is also going to save you battery life and heat over the Pentium 4-M. AMD has PowerNow! technology, which automatically controls the processor speed in relation to its usage.","I gave up multiple desktops a couple of years ago in favor of a single powerful laptop, but paid a price in terms of weight and battery life.","I was working on battery, and plugged it up again while surfing the net and it hard locked again.","When my students saw me coming with it to give a lecture, they immediately started asking questions about poor batteries...","In that case the performance is great but the fan is running full speed and the battery goes quick.","DON\u0027T BE ONE OF THE FIRST TO BUY A NEW PRODUCT.That said, I couldn\u0027t help myself.the MacBook Pro is an outstanding machine, although really not worth the extra $1,000 than the white MacBooks that came out later.The early machines off the line had some problem: mine whines when on battery (although the program QuietMPB helps), had a battery that died after 3 months (replaced for free by Apple) and singes the top of my legs with it\u0027s flamethrower heat.That said, it\u0027s probably my favorite possession.","That was a mistake, for the reasons that follow.Pros:- Was available off the shelf with reasonable specs- Uses mostly decent hardware- Integrated webcam- Quick setup out-of-the-box- Reasonably impressive specs (but comes with Vista, which undoes much of that value)Cons:- Keyboard is flaky (one of my keys died after a year, others have problems and are dying, and nearly half of them have popped off randomly at least once)- Mouse pad is flaky (often stops responding for a couple minutes)- WiFi card crashes a lot (will refuse to turn on; will turn on but not find any networks when I am right next to a router; will find networks with good signals and not connect; will connect but not send anything)- Hard drive is non-standard (can\u0027t replace it with non-Sony drives)- Hard drive is often very slow- Battery life is terrible (less than 1.5 hours at full power, less than 2 on power saver mode) - whoever said it got 4 hours was either lucky, wrong, or using an upgraded battery- CD/DVD drive is *loud*- Integrated speakers are terrible- Integrated microphone is terrible, even by laptop standards- Laptop gets *EXTREMELY* hot, even in standby.","If you\u0027re looking for longer battery life, look elsewhere.","If it was reliable it would have been my best machine ever, battery life is unbelievably good (7 hours on the plane), screen is great and the fingerprint scanner is cool.","When was the last time you heard of a battery lasting for over 3 years?! Mind you, I use this laptop every day.But aside from that, here are some pros:-Unbelievably sturdy and well built-Great display-Great sound quality-Keyboard (I don\u0027t have sticky issues with the keys like some people say they do)-Good quality cameraAnd some cons:-Runs hot.","And even then, you\u0027ll get a much weaker system.OVERALL:The low price for such a powerful, quality laptop made by a highly reputable brand far outweighs the weight and battery consumption issues.","Battery stopped working.","It is thin, not heavy and it has a long battery life.","My DV1000 started having problem after about six months of very light use as its battery charger will not make contact with the laptop pin, and when it did connect, it will continue flipping between battery and electricity charge.","This burns battery power at a furious rate and provides inferior and slow online performance.My FXA47 disconnects frequently online.","VERY LIGHT ONLY 4 LBS AND HAVE REASONABLE BATTERY LIFE ABOUT 3 HRS IF BATTERRY SAVER MODE IS USED .","I have no idea why a link to the Ferrari web site needs to be in anyone\u0027s Active Desktop, and I can\u0027t help feeling that the Ferrari theme and branding has somehow cost me some extra money.If you\u0027re looking for a road warrior system with long battery life and light weight, get a Lenovo Thinkpad.","Battery life is only average though.","The issues varied from a defective battery, to a defective power supply, to defective system fans and overheating, to locking up unexpectedly.","I\u0027m putting up with it because it\u0027s what I need... small, light and very portable, with a battery life that is incredible.","I\u0027ve had this laptop for about 3 years.I installed Windows 7 Home Premium and added an extra 1 Gb of Ram on it and it works great.The only drawbacks that I\u0027ve encountered are:-The trim on the laptop isn\u0027t very durable (plastic fades easily).-The fingerprint reader/software won\u0027t work with Windows 7-Battery life is lacking (less than 5 hours)The Pros:+Easy access to Hard Drive and Ram ports+Made in Japan+DVDRW drive+Lots of USB ports (5 total)This laptop is faster and more usable than a netbook.","The biggest shortcoming is battery life--tops is 2.5 hours; less of course if you\u0027ve got the processor and screen at their highest settings.","As mentioned by other reviewer, the battery life is very poor.","But the processor sucks, the battery life stinks, and multitasking is so so.","You can stretch it a little by dimming the monitor as dark as you can stand, but it\u0027s pretty unlikely you\u0027ll make it through a full-length movie on battery alone--never mind if you want to work for a full coast-to-coast flight.","Check the other PC based Laptop prices and you will see that this thing is really cheap and stylish.And you have a +-4hour of battery life which is enough for everything youl need.Cons: The Glossy LCD Screen is not as good as Sony Xbrite technology.","The newer TX Vaios have a longer standard battery life and some other upgraded features, but cost a few hundred more.","It\u0027s very versatile for a superportable computer, so DVDs and gaming are certainly not out of the question.PROS- Very stylish and sleek looking- Superb display- Tiny- Has dedicated video RAM- Intelligently laid out (this is a huge point with me - all the ports are in useful places)- AC adapter is small and has a cool glowing light which will impress the kind of people who like glowing lights- Has a mute button (the speakers are OK, about what you\u0027d expect from a laptop)- Flawless wireless G integration- Battery life seems pretty goodCONS- Keyboard is bouncy and not too big (and requires Function keys for end, page down etc)- Included software is pretty much useless (but about standard for PC laptops), and comes with various advertisements (Actually, there are a few amusing programs for digital photography and media sharing among many VAIOs, but these are not exactly a hot selling point)- Some ports covered with plastic lids - this actually makes the system look very sleek when they\u0027re closed, but I\u0027m afraid that they might break off at some point, and they\u0027re kind of in the way when you\u0027re hooking things up (this could be either pro or con, really).- According to The Internet, Sony\u0027s customer service is not great, but I haven\u0027t had any problems yet and thus haven\u0027t had to contact them.","Why ?Battery life seems to be the achilles heel for Apple, on most of their products.Thus: 3 stars.","The battery lasted about 2 years until needing replacement and only gave you the 3.5 hours they talked about in energy saving mode, and for minimal use.","I\u0027ve only had it for 6 days and Lithium Ion batteries optimise after a few recharges.","Hopefully something I can fix myself with out voiding the warranty.Well they wanted me to return it to Amazon for the CMOS battery.","I\u0027m guessing that this is what happens when you overcharge a battery constantly by having the laptop plugged in all the time.","Each revision of the mini keeps getting better for me: The keyboard fits my hands well, and the screen, while small, is brilliant and sharp (and at 768x1280, it is ALMOST equivalent to my Powerbook 17\u0026quot;!)It\u0027s fast, the battery life is very good (you really can get 5+ hours - I don\u0027t have to plug it in at work, putting it to sleep at lunch and meetings.","The finish on it is amazing and It looks spectacular all aroundhere are some key points that I really enjoy or dislikePros-Looks Great-Battery life is the best out of any notebook I have and the battery remaining time is pretty accurate.-Built in eyesight is very fun and clever.- I love how light it is-I can go on but this will be a very long listCons-My biggest peeve about this whole transaction was that Amazon shipped the item via UPS which wasn\u0027t a problem to me.","Is it a compromise? Well I guess for those who don\u0027t mind carrying around a 6 lb portable with all the bells and whistles or an ultraportable with slow processor, small keyboard but with more ports, I guess the MBA is.Where there is no compromise is in the speed, full sized keyboard, screen clarity and battery life.","You must use the ultimate battery setting from the sony battery control panel to get this.","If the battery holds up reasonably well for a year or so and it\u0027s easy to get replacement batteries, I think it\u0027s not a bad decision, but if these batteries are not good quality and don\u0027;t last it\u0027ll piss me off.","Another little power-user trick with the fingerprint software is that you can program fingers to open applications from the desktop.Cons/Issues that have come up with me:-Battery life is barely 2.5 hours on balanced power mode with wireless on.","The price for the logic (limited mobility laptop) and the fact that after 2 months, I went ahead and ordered an IBM thats half the weight, 4x the battery life and doesnt create enough heat to cook my lap are why it doesnt get 5 stars.Pros: nice bright screen, latest XP media center Operating system, number pad, ports and card readers for just about everything, good speakers.Cons: It\u0027s a BEAST to carry around, heat, battery consumption, sketchy mouse, lack of bluetooth, price.","You won\u0027t regret it! My 2175US is now 1 Year Old !! Has not crashed even once yet..Lesser heat, Very little Noise, Great battery life..What more do you want from a notebook that costs $1100 ??Absolutely no worries with an AMD.","The Dual Core processor in this instance is not a low voltage, and drains the battery-Integrated Graphics-Slow processor - 1.6GHz is not thrilling, and the benchmarks, although outbeating the HP and Winbook, are not incredibly impressive-Heavy - 4.2lbs is heavy for a 12\" laptop-Terrible customer service - and Avaratec are infamous for not holding up-Lacking in media controls-Lacking in external outputs-Terrible speakers - Just ugly, weak, and tinnyBOTTOM LINE: I good starter laptop.","Great customer service through Apple and it is in no way their fault.Also, it is very important you make sure you get the new battery after the 2006 Sony recall.","He gave me all the drivers I needed and my notebook was complete again.What I don\u0027t like about this notebook is that the battery power allows me to work for about 2.5 hours without plug it.","...I have enjoyed this laptop except for the short battery life.","Battery life is very good, much better than my old Toshiba, and with normal use the battery will last 4+/- hours.","(no serial port though).Now the things that can be improved...First the extended battery is $299 list.","(which for me is bad because I run a spa and need to be online to schedule appointments)Then I saw on the news that the batteries for some of these Toshiba Satellites were recalled due to chance of causing fire! This model as of right now is NOT in that category, but if it were I would be pissed.and last but not least i have to say that the actual battery life of 1.5 hours is RIDICULOUS. that i HATE.so pros and cons. but for $699, what the heck?! So, I really like this computer, but it shuld come standard with more RAM, given that Vista seems to use an awful lot of it! I really like the finish and the size though, smaller without compromising its use as an entertainment PC.","My problem is that there is no place in U.S. to buy additional components, ie. battery, for Gericom laptops.","I\u0027ve replaced the battery after it didn\u0027t take as much of a charge, and a couple of years ago installed a larger hard drive.","Fast procesor, nice bright backlid screen and terrific battery life, I get an average of 4.5 hours or normal real time use (unlike P.C. notebooks that advertise 3 hours, but in real time use, surfing the web, typing, they end up low on power in 1 and 40 minutes) I mean why advertise you get 3 hours but only if you leave it on and don\u0027t do anything with it.","Apple unlike other companies just asks some simple on-line questions and they will overnight you a new battery without delay, period!If you read consumer reports you will see for yourself the kind of quality and service you will receive.","Great battery life.","After 4 months of use, here are some things I consider notable:+ Clean exterior lines, glossy-black exterior with sharp-cut edges contrasting with simple, polished silver interior+ No annoying, high pitched capacitor whine+ hibernation/sleep/wake is flawless+ sweat from your palm does not permanently stain the enamel finished palmrest+ fan noise really low after April 2006 BIOS release update+ included Microsoft OneNote 2003 is quite useful with great UI+ LCD: LG Philips LPG6500 15\" XGA TFT+ HDD: Toshiba MK4026GAX 40GB 5400RPM with 16MB cache+ Takes power efficient DDR2 4200 Memory (compared to DDR) (Hynix DDR2-533 1.8V 256MB preinstalled)+ Optical Drive: TSST TS-L462C- Noisy optical drive (unless you set the quiet drive utility manually, which always defaults into \"noisy mode\")- Celeron Processor does not throttle down even when doing nothing- Left palm area warm- BATTERY LIFE (~1hr, 4 cell 29 Watt hour basic pack)- no card reader or IEEE 1394All in all, Toshiba really packs some high quality components into this nicely designed/built \"budget\" notebook.","HP says each time you do a deep discharge, you reduce the overall life of battery.","The biggest contrast between the two is in battery life, the AV3250 lasts a little more than 2 hours (maybe 2.5) under normal use (not playing a DVD, just typing etc.), the iBook almost 4 (both have Li-Ion batteries).","And the battery life is soo good.","I have it clocked down so it doesn\u0027t use the battery as much.","It protrudes within a range of about an inch or so...no biggie at all! And it\u0027s lightweight...even with the battery in...so convenient.There are many more features to explore on this computer and since I only bought this last week, I still have yet to discover them.","I would hope this lasts at least 2-3 years for the price.Pros:-Very light, feels lighter than most of my textbooks-Screen is amazingly bright-I love the ability to toggle the video card modes for battery life and performance-Screaming fast performance with the Core 2 Duo T7200 and 2 gigs of ram-Vista Business is amazing.","I bought the 2nd optional battery (slice) from toshiba for $149 since they sent me a coupon after I registered the tablet at their site.","Sony needs to concentrate on making TVs which it\u0027s still very good at! Can easily handle new games like Half Life 2, Fable, and Battlefield 2--but I still take it to class every day as it\u0027s easy to carry in my backpack and the battery lasts about an hour an a half (note to the guy who wrote the last review-I think your battery is defective).I have had this computer for just under a year now, and I love it.","I contacted Sony and they told me that the warranty on the battery was only 30 days and that I should buy a new battery.","All the compartments underneath, such as the battery and memory covers, seem to fit well and are easily removed.The main thing to watch for on the T22 is pressure marks on the TFT screen, which will leave white or lightened spots on darker backgrounds.","Calibrating the Battery.","I have already had to replace my battery (wouldn\u0027t sustain charge), power cord (burned out and no longer worked), and now the part where my headphones goes in has become loose and is pretty much unusable.","It is not a bad battery though, when HP was contacted, they confirmed that the battery that comes with the laptop is only supposed to last an hour.","You can add 250 and 500 GB hard drives in the modular bays (if you wish to remove the DVD drive and the battery - everything is hot-swappable).I\u0027ve ONLY JUST sold this laptop after over 3 years of intense (8-12 hours almost every day) use.","The only problem is that the laptop came with a 12 cell battery and is very big.","I knocked a star off my review because of the battery life and the (I assume necessary) fan sound.","I\u0027m very happy with the battery life, the operating system, and the apps I use on this machine (Office X mostly).","Boots up super fast, decent on battery usage.","The Toshiba does this by having a shorter battery life and no built in drive.","The first one had defective battery and I returned it.","Much to my dissapointment there was 0 charge and the battery appeared totaly dead as described in some previous posts on this website.I was ready to contact Apple but decided to run Software update again and after I installed the operating system update another update showed up titled: \"Aluminum PowerBook (15-inch) Battery Firmware Update\".","I travel a lot and take lots of digital pictures, so this is perfect in terms of portability and performance.Pros:Small form factorHuge hard driveGreat battery life (avg. 3 hrs)DVD burnerSD/MMC card readerExternal monitor supportCons:No floppy driveNo manual or support documentationNo original discs for installed software (for backup)No IEEE 1394 ports (FireWire) I own a dual core laptop with 2 gigs ram and a fast hardrive and was looking for something to take notes one, a small tabletthat was small enough to carry in my laptop bag with my laptop, but large enough to take notes on.So far this device has exceeded my expectations.I have taken notes on it for 2 days now with MSFT\u0027s onenote loaded.The machine keeps up with my writing.I loaded all of MSFT office enterprise edition on it for the fun of it and Lotus notes 7 for my corp email.I am trying the new windows live mail instead of using outlook for my personal email.","One issue might be that this antenna could possibly break easily...One of the most important improvements was in battery life.","I was never a battery-swapper anyway, so that\u0027s not an issue.","The bad news--Toshiba has not yet (as of this writing) made a longer lasting battery for this model.","Whew.So...no great shocks so far, love the small small small size of this unit, and the light light light weight and the long battery life.","First, you don\u0027t want to use this as a business traveller\u0027s notebook: the heavy weight and super-short battery life make it an unappealing choice for use on long plane or car rides when there\u0027s potentially no power supply available.The computer is a powerhouse you can pack up and easily take with you, but consider yourself tethered to a power supply after settling in at your destination.Second, the RAM is expandable to 2 GB, but the two available slots are already taken by the factory-supplied 512 MB chips which you\u0027ll have to discard if you upgrade.Third, the speakers are pretty wimpy.","This laptop tends to get really hot while running on its batteries.","And with energy savings enabled I get over 4 hours battery usage.--Update after 6 monthsI\u0027m still loving my PowerBook, but have developed one issue that\u0027s become a big concern.","For the same price, a comparable Windows Laptop has a much worse battery life, and all the security holes to go with it.","so I\u0027d recommend that the buyer consider whether or not the battery life is needed.I\u0027m truly impressed with how the system performs.","I believe battery needs to be cultivated which I didn\u0027tin the begining.Given the duration and to the extend I used this system, i don\u0027t have much complain on this.","After contacting the HP customer support center (in India) and going through various diagnostics over the phone, HP sent a replacement battery, which also failed to charge.","The unit is pretty battery intensive.","The only draw back is the battery life but you can always upgrade to a extended battery at the cost of the laptop you should be able to afford it.","Luckily, I saw those forums and fixed it by myself.9) Aweful battery life.","If the Sony was plugged in, and the Toshiba was on battery, the power settings would have dimmed the Toshiba screen.","It runs HOT like a furnace as the fans try to cool the machine.This leads to the 2nd part of power management - battery life.","Fan stays on at varying speeds to maintain temperature below 50 deg C. Battery lasts about 2.5 hours with wireless connection on.","I had the CMOS battery run down last week after over three years of use, but replacements are easy and cheap to find - check on here or eBay.","The battery lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes.","Not 5 starts due to shorter battery life, pre-loaded garbage, and power supply problem.","The things I like best about this laptop are its screen, sleek look, but more importantly great processor speed and good battery life.","Got it for 1149 at Circuit City.The Bad:1) It is still pricey.2) Does not have graphics card, for gamers.3) Does not have HDMI.4) Battery life is poor about 1.5-2 hours with power save mode on!!5) I think the resolution for 15.4 inch should be better.","I have other battery\u0027s of same type from my last computer of same model.","Let me tell you about my experience with this laptop:Brand new, the battery didn\u0027t last an hour.","The notebook measures only 12.42\u0026quot;x10.2\u0026quot;x.94\u0026quot; and weighs in at less than 4 1/2 pounds with the battery.","The included standard 6-cell battery does not have great endurance; I would say up to two hours, maybe.","New battery cost me $200.","My eldest still working with his factory fitted battery although with very short time, but enough for changing from wall plug.After 1 1/2 year The FZ140E/S battery stopped without any warning thanks to an special internal device controlling the electrical flow.","Also,the battery life is very good.","If you use non-demanding software and no CD drive, you will have around 4.5 - 5.5 hours of battery, which is GREAT.","One thing I didn\u0027t like is the weight, over 8 pounds with the battery, much heavier than the competition.After hearing so many stories about problems with laptops, I quickly unpacked it and fired it up.","So my laptop\u0027s battery time is now as good as my wife\u0027s G4 powerbook, so i\u0027m happy.This model also had other bonuses that I didn\u0027t expect for this price, like the DVD burner, 512mb ram, Firewire, and a genrous HD of 60GB.","The battery was a primary concern, and with the power management keeping the screen at its brightest, and the CPU reduced to minimal power, the Toshiba gets about 2.5-3.0 hours if you don\u0027t do a lot of gaming.","Get the kind of external speakers that last a long time with their own batteries, not USB powered ones.","Yes the latch is badly designed, and the battery lock is even worse.","also, i often get 6 or 8 hours out of a single charge on my battery, when the others ive mentioned were getting 2.","I get about 3.5 hours worth of battery and that\u0027s with the brightness/computer performance down to it\u0027s low.2) A ton of preloaded Sony junk when you first turn it on.","But I never had that problem, and I find the light to be annoying.*Accessories from my old Toshiba (battery charger, battery) don\u0027t work with this one.","The laptop overheats, battery life sucks, -- nothing more i can say! Time for a macbook!Not the mention, THE SUPPORT SUCKS!!!Bye Ok so I am not accustomed to the MAC world but I was so sick of Microsoft Windows.","I have a couple of questions, first of all are there any other accessories such as battery pack, charger, storage case? What about serial and parallel ports? What about compatability with scanners, printers, gaming software, shipping charges? etc.","For a while there I was even toting along an extra notebook computer -- for use by others so they could stop asking to use my new P105.At first I was concerned about the battery life, having long since been spoiled by the ACTUAL five hour battery life of the P25 -- under intensive use.","A double capcity battery is $500, which is abosultely a rip off.A little research found that there\u0027s more than 10 devices were attached IRQ 9, while many other IRQs are free.","The battery life is moderate: about 2-3 hrs depending on use.Be aware that the \"Quickplay\" does not play outside of windows...it only automatically plays after windows starts if you press the DVD button.","P15s, and P25s are low battery life (like complaining about gas mileage while driving a Ferrari), size and weight.","The great weakness of the M2010 is it\u0027s 6 cell battery, which will not get you through a 2 hour DVD; a 12 cell is available, but only from HP at $180, about 1/3 the price of the whole computer.","The only thing I would have liked better would be a longer lasting battery (I estimate about 2 hours with the standard battery) I just read other\u0027s reviews about the fan and I have to say I had the same problem... until I uninstalled the Sony energy saving software.","It was in better condition than I expected, and, except for a weak battery, I have no complaints.","Works great out of the box and battery lasts for a little over 2 hours when I am working on it.","Beautifully designed, light weight, nice color, very good keyboard, amazing Screen Quality and Sound, Fast, good battery life, good price for centerino, and made by Toshiba.If you want to get a new laptop or to replace the existing one, just take a look at this and then read some reviews, you have to see it for yourself and play with it for a few minutes and compare it to others, then you will see what I meant and why I very much recommend it.","Go Centrino technology!- Comes with many programs inside (Windows XP, MS Works, Picture It!, Jukebox, etc)- The battery looks cool.","A higher capacity battery is available from Toshiba for those who need it.As others have pointed out, this is not a gamer\u0027s machine.","Now they are sending me the 2.5 to 3 hour battery free, and they suggested I keep that battery that lasts an hour so I can carry it around with me as I have 2 lectures in a row and need the battery to last a minimum of 3 hours, which we all know it won\u0027t.","I took the battery out completely to see if that helped.","Everything is good for the exception of one thing: I have to sit close to the outlet because the battery that was shipped with this $2,000 computer was dead!

The answer is simple: VAIO is indeed the best (Apple\u0027s products not included, since it is a different world).I was checking this Notebook that a friend bought few days ago; nothing really impressive: the battery life is less than average, the touch and feel of the keyboard is \"Korean cars quality\", solidness does not appear anywhere, the case is plastic, soft and lack serious resistance; the hard is noisy (with less than 10 days of interruptive work??); and my HP omnibook xe4400 (3 years old) has the same brightness and sound quality.","Put it on a desk.- No modem, but in almost 3 yrs w/ a laptop, I\u0027ve only used a modem twice.I work full-time and take classes in the mornings and on weekends--the battery life will be much apprciated next Fall, as well as the range of features this little thing has.","Has anybody else have had this problem?The other day, I actually took out the battery to look if there was something I could it, and there was some white liquid over it--looked like the battery was leaking.","Some recurring issues in forums are: overheating issues, dead pixel (one) on the LCD (which some tech guy at a store told me is common on LCD screens, anyhow), smaller keyboard size (true enough, but it\u0027s not bad at all), sound system not being outstanding (come on, people, get a desktop for such extensive audio work!), and the Windows XP Home Edition that\u0027s pre-loaded (yes, really, DO upgrade to the Pro Edition, as it\u0027s less \"buggy\").BUT, what notebook is perfect? What other notebook has this much power, speed, battery power-saving capabilities (Centrino, baby), DVD-RW/CD-RW, Widescreen LCD screen display (you have to SEE to believe..it\u0027s SO beautifully bright that you can\u0027t help but be mesmerized and think \"purty\"!), 80GB storage capacity, firewire port, 4 USB ports, built-in wireless WiFi connectivity (get the Linksys Wireless router WRT54G for faster, more reliable speed), SD memory storage, and at 6 lbs., what else could you want?

They all do or will at some point.","I wasn\u0027t expecting it to be a \"killer\" gaming rig, but I thought with a P4 HT, Radeon 9000, and 1+GHz Ram - it would do a better job.-Poor Battery life, well under 2 hours.","I also got an error once where an alert said I had the \"wrong battery inserted\" and the unit had to shut down.","Finally, I recommend purchasing an extended life battery if you\u0027re looking at running off the battery for longer than the length of two movies.","On top of this, the screen resolution is very strange (it has double images, when you switch from a page to another, the previous page\u0027s shadow stays on the screen), and the battery lasts for about an hour.","Fonts are displayed very poorly with quite a bit of washout.Word processing is very, very slow - frequently the displayed words lag behind my typing - very annoying.DVD playing is good and the battery life is impressive.You are stuck with iTunes for music, although I was able to finally find a utility to let me play music without creating a playlist and manually sorting it, but all the millions of iTune lovers will probably disagree.THE ABSOLUTE WORST PART OF THE MACHINE IS HOW SLOW IT IS.","Feels very tough and sturdy.Cons:It\u0027s kind of heavy and the battery life isnt going to carry you that long (roughly 2.5 hours with LinuxOS and *I think* old battery) but I leave it plugged in most of the time and have watched a 2 hour movie on the battery alone.The R52 is getting pretty old tech in laptop terms.","The long battery life easily lasts me through a days worth of classes without having to recharge.","That could be easily fixed with purchasing another battery or simply using the cord.","Buying this computer was like throwing money into the fire as I literally watched it fall apart before my eyes.The fan is extremely loud (like my classmates turned around and looked at my loud), the battery only last at most 2 hours (less if running iTunes, listening to a CD or watching a DVD) and it gets extremely hot when used for more than 2 hours- both on your wrists while typing and on the bottom making it very difficult to actually sit in your lap.My internal wireless broke as did my CD burner in less than 3 months.","With the extended life battery I get around 6 hours of continuous operation at my normal levels (if you dim the screen a lot, you can get closer to 8).","Battery life is roughly 3 hours.","I bought the six-hour battery for my first round of finals and it ran fine on \"full\" power for 4 hours, but that was an expensive investment I was expecting to make.","It is very powerful and can be quite a beast with a set of good speakers, memory upgrade, and an extra battery.","After about 2 months since purchasing the laptop, something broke and I couldn\u0027t use it without the battery in it.","The only thing that the Sony has on it is the battery life.","The batteries went (almost) dead after 10 months.","The only problem if you buy this battery for around a $100 is that it sticks out a little in the back and weighs twice as much.Operating System: Vista at this time is not better than XP.","My recommendation if you purchase this is to swing for Sony\u0027s large capacity battery.","The screen could be a bit brighter, but is quite nice nonetheless, the keyboard is comfortable, and the battery life is decent at ~3 hours, and it\u0027s great to have a dual layer-comptable DVD writer.","This \"official\" fix cuts battery life by more than 50% and likely will result in the premature death of the processor.","I\u0027ve upgraded the ram to the full amount and, out of personal preference, swapped the DVD drive and the battery module.","Battery life on the unit is more than I imagined: with the brightness at 5/8 with WiFi enabled, music streaming to an Airport Express from iTunes, while browsing the web, I achieved 4 hours and 43 minutes before the battery gave out (this was with the regular battery--extended is on the way--double the runtime and total weight of the laptop and extende battery is 4.55 lbs).","The battery increases the size and weight, of course, but you can be the judge of whether you need to take it with you.Everything has been easy to configure.","With the supplied 3-cell battery, you will be able to run your laptop in \"high\" performance setting for about an hour.","But shouldn\u0027t it come with the laptop if they\u0027re going to charge $3000 already?? Why cheap out on the battery?The last noteworthy item is its 8 1/2 lb weight.","The battery life is fantastic, but that doesn\u0027t really matter when nothing else is working correctly.Don\u0027t waste your time or your money on this computer.","It turns out that the heat from the device is shortening the battery life.","And it really make me feel good about my decision of buying tr3a when people just can\u0027t stop eyeing this babe..PROS: Small size, Light weight, Best features including bright display, inbuilt cd-dvd drive, inbuilt webcam and mic, all possible slots including usb, flash card reader, magicdrive, wi-fi ready, better battery life.","Really more to impress your freinds than anything else.Overall, the lightweightness, bright screen, long battery life, and cd/dvd drive for watching movies on airplanes when you don\u0027t want to do any more work, really makes this one of the best laptops on the market today.Highly recommended.","I wish the battery lasted longer because I bought it for school.","Within weeks of replacing it, the current screen developed bad pixels- but not enough that Lenovo will replace it.10 months after I got the computer the battery failed- Lenovo wouldn\u0027t cover this part because they listed it as in service date 12.5 months and said that the battery coverage was limited at a year.A month ago my AC power converter failed and I had to spend 30 minutes to convince customer support that was the actual problem .","There were quite a few updates and after installing them I checked to see how the battery charge was going.","I get about an hours worth of use out of it.If I do any file copies, the battery immediately moves to 50% the rest of the laptop is just fine.","I generally use it on the AC power supply and let run on battery all the way to failure once each month to keep the battery conditioned.","It\u0027s been great with me and i would highly recomment to anyone.... to heavy, battery life is short...... otherthan these awesome note book I bought this out of frustration with PCs.","It has exceptional battery life, (5 hours plus.)","From fully charged to hibernate the battery lasted 2 hours and 40 minutes.","The battery is also extremely poor.","I run most of these at once and have no issues at all!I also like the battery life.","My previous Port\u0026eacute;g\u0026eacute; laptops have been extremely reliable, over periods of more than 5 years of intensive use.In fact, my only major complaint is that, since I like to travel without the battery, to eliminate extra weight, this design does not allow the machine to be used normally without the battery in place: Two of the three feet under the front palm rest are actually on the battery itself, so removing it leaves the front area in mid air, and unstable for normal use.Still, very highly recommended as a travel laptop.","But it won\u0027t blow you away if you\u0027re used to other fairly recent computers.2) Despite the \"speedstep\" technology, in actual use I can\u0027t get better than about 75 minutes battery life.3) It weighs over eight pounds, and because of the short battery life, you\u0027ll end up carrying the brick-sized AC adapter with you, which weighs almost 2 lbs.","They sent us a package to send the notebook back and since it was a battery issue, we also sent the adaptor and power cord.","However, the SZ has an option to turn off the NVIDIA card and use the integrated graphics card to save battery life which I find useful.","The optical drive will play and record CDs and will play DVDs beautifully on an extra crisp 10.6\u0026quot; screen (and battery life is longer than any DVD I can think of).The hard drive is an adequate 40 gigs.","The battery would not hold a charge and the actual computer would not run on the power cord.","Poor/sluggish performance even after upgrading memory to 2GB.Takes quite a bit of time to boot up/down.Does not respond well to automatic Windows updatesDO NOT TRY TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS VISTA HOME PREMIUM!! I tried and the computer is completely unusable! Common/expected functionality non-existant! HP Support not available after upgrade! positives:- incredible screennegatives:- horrible battery life (due to incredible screen)- often not compatible with iTunes (call SONY if you don\u0027t believe me).","Plus I flashed the bios to the newest version.I already had an old Dell Latitude CP 233mhz that went bad, but the battery from it is a match to the one I bought + the AC power supply is compatible.","The battery power is the poorest, yet most important component of this notebook.","Battery life isn\u0027t great (maybe 3 hours) but these systems blow away every Dell laptop I have purchased in the past three years for double the price.","My initial benchmark test showed a score of 8843, so I\u0027m excited to learn what the score will be after upgrading.If there are any major changes with the laptop, I will update.UPDATE:The first thing I would like to update on is battery life.","Doesn\u0027t bother me, certainly doesn\u0027t detract from the machine\u0027s looks in my mind, and I\u0027ll take that long battery life any day.","replacement battery is very very expensive.","sony has done a good job with is this relatively low-cost powerfull notebook.i will not bore you with the pros about this machine since you can find the good things all over but be aware that there are couple of things that sony could improve to make this laptop even better; first is that the user should have the freedom to upgrade the os at any time, i could not upgrade my vaio to winxp pro; second sony should have system boards that support pc133 sdram and ddr-sdram, the fx series only support pc100 dsram so you can\u0027t fully experience the power of the athlon with a slow memory bandwidth of a pc100 memory; third the fx series should be equipped with newer video cards, the ati rage is quite old and it only has 8mb sdram at 2x agp, i would strongly recommend at minimum a relatively new video card with 16mb ddr-sdram at 4x agp because the fx/fxa series are supposed to be powerfull machines; fourth, don\u0027t expect the battery to last you long since powerfull computers demand a lot of power and because amd cpu\u0027s eat up a lot of energy even their newest .18 micron cpu\u0027s.so these are just minor setbacks on sony fxa\u0027s, but if you compare these with other companies like hp, compaq, etc, you will find out that these flaws are almost nothing.","I have never wanted for processing speed, and i can take the thing around places, so my basic needs are satisfied.The problems:A) low battery life.","It\u0027s great! A lot of University\u0027s are building these wireless networks into their campuses now, which makes it even better for the student.Finally, here\u0027s two tips I\u0027d offer:Calibrate the Battery.","I researched this and it looks like it\u0027s an issue with the CPU power saving technology switching back and forth, and was able to fix it by installing a free utility called RMClock, which fixes the noise but reduces battery life a bit by keeping the CPU from going into the lowest level of activity for power saving.","Since I had purchased a laptop for its portability and deliberately chose a model with a battery life \u0026gt;2 hours, this was a problem for me! Leaving it plugged in all the time effectively transformed it to a desktop, which is not what I had wanted..","battery life is a little on the short side, but what do you expect from something this powerful? i probably wouldn\u0027t recommend extensive traveling with this beast due to it\u0027s sheer size and short battery life (in addition to finding a laptop case that will fit it), but as a portable desktop going from room to room in your house, it should fit the bill just fine.","I bought this computer in November, 2007 so I\u0027ve had it for about 9 months and I haven\u0027t experienced any of the problems that some others have noted..i.e. the battery falling out, blurry video quality, excessively short battery life, etc...","I love my home/end/pgup/pgdn keys so you either need to get used to pressing FN at the same time or remap your keys in software.-Battery.","Love being able to put 2 batteries in it.","The loose battery is extremely annoying but no big problem..","Probably overpriced by about $150, equipped with a battery that is dead and not chargable.","Fantastic!

Dell uses a lot of proprietary hardware, particularly the Power Supply Unit! This is something you MUST upgrade if you want to upgrade your video card.OK, another caveat.","Two months later the power supply died, the next month the motherboard went south.Based on that experience with Sony, I wouldn\u0027t recommend this product.","So, in the end, it makes no difference.I\u0027m now using the Toshiba, and the power supply cuts in and out as it wants.","I did not want a repeat of the graphics card failure, so I ended up putting the laptop on a wire dish-rack ($5 in the housewares section of your local discount store)and it lifted the laptop enough to give adequate ventilation.Also, the power supply is a huge brick, and the battery life is terrible, not surprising for a 17\" laptop with a desktop-type processor, but I mention this because the laptop itself is heavy, and if you plan to travel with it occasionally, the power supply is going to add weight.Also, I had wanted a 17\" laptop because I wanted a separate numeric keypad built into the laptop - the ZD7010us delivered and I really liked the keyboard - great feel and good key placement and size -- much better than the DV9910us I am using to write this review.","But this just means one thing, which we already knew: Sony knows how to make a TV.And finally...I bought this computer in the first place because it had excellent specs, a good size, and, especially, a low weight (though the power supply must easily weigh a pound).","Basically, the power supply unit on this laptop failed within the first month of use for no aparent reason, however the seller was very prompt and replaced the defective PSU right away.As for the laptop itself, it is very nice in a nice form factor (not too large or too small).The only bad thing is that I noticed windows tells me that it has only 384MB of RAM, which is wrong because the specs on amazon claime it has 512MB RAM, however before I rush to conclussions my guess is that the other 128MB are probably allocated to the video card (which in any case is missleading advertising), so I\u0027ll take a look at that and see what\u0027s going on.","The biggest laptop power supply I have ever seen.","The \"customer care\" department has been in my experience, to put it kindly -- lacking!

And did I mention that the AV fan is very noisy?Another little detail: The iBook power supply lets you wrap the cable around it thanks to 2 fold-out hooks, for the AV power supply I had to get a strap to tame the cable.And last not least, the edge of the trackpad on my AV rubs against the screen when it is closed and leaves a 1.5\" long mark.","by the time you load up the laptop, power supply (huge by its own right), accessories in your laptop carrying case, well hold on cause this thing gets heavy on a long trek, long like from your office to your car.Compared to other laptops this one does not cook your legs as it operates so it runs relatively cool even under the most demanding games like supreme commander.HD dvd is nice but the battery life does not hold long enough to complete a full movie.This unit comes with the TV tuner feature.","I bought a PCG-V505BX at the same time and the power supply is the smallest I have ever seen.","I just supplied the service order number and two days later I got my new Power Supply AC Adapter.","Amazingly, the power supply on my old Dell 5150 weighed more than one pound!

Those other maligned ports on the Latitude (a SVGA, a serial, a parallel and a DIN mouse/keyboard) are actually pretty useful if you travel without tons of stuff, relying instead on whatever is in your destination\u0027s inventory - mice, external projectors, older printers.","Yes, the keyboard is a little small for my hands, but I just type a little slower and check for accuracy more often.I read all the reviews here before buying.","The keyboard is flawless on this machine.","It has a locking mechanism to secure the battery to the main unit.I actually like the keyboard better than my old Sony notebook (K-series).","The dual networking WLAN and mobile phone is great and works a treat.Two regrets, the Keyboard is rubbish, difficult to use quickly and, as a Mac user who uses OS X all day and I had forgotten how poor Windows was - it was a bit of a shock to have use an operating system that so unfriendly and unreliable.Would definitely buy again, if you need a UMPC this is the one.","Overall, it\u0027s an attention to detail that I really appreciate on both the hardware and the software side - little things like a backlit, auto-dimming keyboard or the magnetic power connector.","Kensington external keypad in which to facilitate entering in different component values without having to hunt an peck on the keyboard and burning my wrist badly.For me, it is a fabulous set-up.","Keyboard ---- there\u0027s something special about this keyboard - its pretty cool4.","The DVD playback seemed to work well during the couple of times I tried it.So, absent the keyboard issue, generally recommended, and a good value if you need XP Pro. i bought this as my second computer, i have a PC, and i like it so well.","This time it took more than a month for all the repairs - among the parts that were replaced were the power supply cord and the keyboard.","I have not experienced this problem yet (washed hands?), but when shopping for a computer, I actually looked for a light colored/white keyboard so I could tell when the keyboard is dirty.","The keyboard is very good, with full size spacing and decent feel.","Lets get to what you want to hear, the cons, if you dont care about these, buy it:1)Keyboard, terrible layout, you get used to is a few month\u0027s later, unfortunately no one else has your layout so using someone elses computer, say your jobs for example, is hell.2)Battery Life : Hour and a half at the most if being used.","(...)About the product...Pros:-excellent screen-Nice keyboard-Nice touchpad (configurable)-Good performance but not for gaming-sery slim, lightweight, sexy notebookCons-battery life is exactly 100 with full brightness-slight humming noise when brightness is not set to full otherwise runs very cool-shared RAM ... not for heavy graphics uses-hard disk is slower but I don\u0027t care-Short keys S1, S2 are not well designedconclusion:A must buy notebook about two weeks after the warranty ended.","The keyboard is well laid out.","This machine is solid as they come.Speaking of solid: the keyboard is easily the best I have ever used on a laptop.","A decent set of speakers, external keyboard by IBM and external mouse and this thing Rocks.","There is no keyboard mapping utility at this point in time to make the up arrow toggle to shift key or vice versa.","The upper right hand corner of the keyboard routinely pops out of the case and must be reinserted with a hard push on the Delete key - with a carefully chosen cursor location.","What I did not like is that it has only 1 PS/2 Port which means that either you can connect a mouse or a keyboard but not both simultaneously.","Have no fear about the keyboard.","The screen is too small (to be expected with a netbook), however the keyboard is WAY too small and unreliable.","I had no trouble at all touch typing on the VAIO after using my full size keyboard.","I need a machine to do what I tell it to do, not a Christmas Elf to help me messing up everything.Then the keyboard, the poor design of combine the up/down/left/right cursor key to the pageup/pagedown/home/end keys.","He said it rarely happens for a mac to have faulty keyboard.","My only complaint is about the keyboard which is a downgrade from all the previous vaio models with big travel distance and obvious flex.","The replacement had problems with screen, I sent it in for repairs and it stayed in their repair shop for over two months waiting for parts! By July, the keyboard would stop working whenever the machine had been on for a half hour.","It looked good in begining but I started to notice keyboard goes on Caps lock itself, and to get it back to normal, I either have to keep pressing cap\u0027s key for 15 minutes or more - until it gets back otherwise turn off the computer and than turn it on again.","Plastic keyboard covers could cause overheating.","The keyboard isn\u0027t as easy to operate as the much smaller Treo - definitely needs to be revisited by Sony.","The keyboard feels rock solid.And this thing is quick!! I only have 512MB of Ram in it but I will upgrade to 2Gs when I install Photoshop.","The unit is put together well but visually, the looks are an acquired taste.Another problem is the keyboard which seems so small compared to the rest of the laptop.","I hardly ever find myself looking for keys on the keyboard.","This smallness does NOT sacrifice power, and the Toshiba comes out ahead of comparable systems in processing speed and other benchmarks, but there are sacrifices: a smaller keyboard than the preferred industry standard IBM-LENOVO laptops, and a smaller screen than the luxuriously huge gaming and multimedia machines by Sony and most other makers.","Love it, Love it, Love it!!!This is the best \u0027laptop\u0027 I\u0027ve ever had -- great graphics, serious sound, and a cool keyboard design.","There are still a few minor things missing, like the back-lit keyboard, which works under OS X but not yet under XP.Anyway, so far this is a gorgeous laptop for OS X or Windows XP.","Yes the keyboard is small but it is a small computer.","Sony keyboard is located way down, which means you dont have support while typing.7.","The keyboard (shamelessly copied from Apple, IMHO) is responsive and nice to use; the screen is out-of-this-world clear and bright; and the specs for the price are extremely comparable to the real competition, which is the smaller Dells.So far, I\u0027ve nothing to complain about except the battery life, which is not at all bad when you\u0027re not doing much, but runs down fast with a DVD going.","My former laptop was a Presario 2500 and the screen wasn\u0027t bright enough without having it maxed out which reduces battery time.Good keyboard ,sound is very good, only negative is the cpu fan runs constantly but not real loud.","no need for bought software or software that came with your camera.the interesting new low-charge standby mode is useful and pleasant.it has win-dvd, which works, but--the escape key on my keyboard doesn\u0027t work at all, ever, (!) and i have to shut down the computer completely to get a movie off the full screen.there are only two usb ports, but you don\u0027t need one for pics anymore, and there are two picture card ports.i can\u0027t watch videos on the internet for more than three seconds without their freezing up.sometimes the computer gets confused, freezes, and jumps around the internet.","The keyboard works fine.","Most laptops have it on the bottom of the PC and this one is under the keyboard and a heatsink/protective cover.Sound is excellent, though, if a little quiet.","The screen, keyboard and sound are excellent.","Now you have a fully-functional keyboard when you need to write that 20-page document.Once again, a remarkable machine, with great potential.","Keyboard is awkward in my opinion.","BTW, huge problems that Toshiba is finding impossible to solve... a faulty keyboard and a touchpad! I previously reviewed the M505X in January 2004 when I initially purchased it, comparing it to the Toshiba M35-S359, and giving it 5 stars.Since then, I have had a few issues.","I\u0027ve had to reinstall my touch pad drivers a few times.The keyboard is also a little screwy as far as its demensions go.","The keyboard is excellence compare to my old compaq.","In addition, I really like the soft quiet keyboard, the light weight of this laptop, and many Toshiba touchpad options.","One of my favorite things about it is the keyboard actually, it is designed to be quieter/softer and its nice that that is something Sony thought about in a cheaper laptop.","I had been reluctant to adapt to notebook PCs due to the small keyboards and most laptops/notebooks are not really either small nor light.I bought mine as if by love at first sight, beautifull siver, 1\" thick and 4.5 lbs in weight, it stood out on the shelf.The Averatec is fast enough so that you really won\u0027t miss ultra fast processing (wouldn\u0027t make sense to expect workstation or gamestation ultra speed in a notebook for the road) I would think.It\u0027s a problem of definition, for me a \"portable PC\" is just what Averatec packages in the 3270, the best performance you can get economically.With a 60/80 Gb HD, DVD burner, wireless card, SMALL and LIGHT frame, 2.5 hour battery, great screen, 512 Mb memory...I watch DVD\u0027s, browse, work with Photoshop, listen to music and get asked frequently \"what PC is that... for how much..?It does perfectly well all that is not \"extreme\", but then again, how much extreme do you need..?Makes me feel great.I dumped my Toshiba Satellite and wouldn\u0027t pay 2000 bucks for a replacement, I tell you.But got mine for $900.00 and got a $150 bucks rebate.Need to have the fastestes or most expensive..? Don\u0027t look here.Need a PORTABLE PC...?Get an Averatec ! I had been researching on ultramobile PCs for quite a while and even looked at the Asus Eee PC, which is cheap but has a terrible low-res low-quality screen (and weighs a hefty 2 lbs, the same as my Sharp PC-MM20 *real* laptop with more memory and a 40GB hard drive).","The screen images are wonderful, I love the key board which has a full keyboard with numeric key pad.","When I received the Laptop, the keyboard was out of place and body had scratches on it and I had to send it back again.","The 3715 doesn\u0027t even have an up and a down button off of the keyboard, you have to use two hands, one to push the Fn control, the other to carefully poke on the undersized Fn keys.","The keyboard is sized for real fingers, not little alien tentacles.","The icons magnifying and jumping, the mag-safe connector, the backlit keyboard glowing in the dark, and general weight and \u0027thinness\u0027 make the computer a joy to use.The biggest thing though is that I haven\u0027t really had any problems (touch wood).","I like the keyboard a lot.","Open it up and the screen had no dead pixels, the keyboard had no dead keys.","The keyboard is fine.","Caveat: we did not intend this to be a desktop replacement machine, so there\u0027s not a whole lot of multitasking going on.* Not much has been mentioned about the keyboard, which is one of the best notebook keyboards I\u0027ve used.","It brought me back to the days of my first laptop which is more than a dozen years ago which had a pointer in the middle of the keyboard.","The 15.4\" laptop screen is not \"Full-HD\" as the sticker on the keyboard seems to imply, but then again, we primarily use this on a projector, so screen size \u0026 resolution is not as important.* The 4200RPM seemed like it would be a bottleneck, but that hasn\u0027t been a problem for us.","No such light on the Mac.7-you may have problems listening to Sirius radio on Safari; I needed to use Internet Explorer (Hah! much touted Mac browser useless for audio?), and even then can\u0027t get fully functional display due to some Mac technicality, according to Sirius techs.reasons to buy:1-Largely virus-free because virus writers get more leverage attacking pc\u0027s (more market penetration and more business focused); this is a blessing because I found Norton AV \u002704 to be dysfunctional, glad not to have to deal with it anymore.2-Supposedly faster processing due to more streamlined operating system, though I don\u0027t find the mac to be any more responsive than even a lower priced pc3-Faster boot-up and shutdown.4-Fewer crashes-true, though not infallible either; mac\u0027s version of the PC blue screen is that some won\u0027t wake up after going to sleep5-cool keyboard, backlit in the dark; very romantic and pretty.Rating of 3 stars indicates sameness...it\u0027s as good as a PC, just different.","As example I set the iTunes library in a 4GB memory stick and was able to get almost four hours of music with a single charge.As conclusion I highly recommend the machine, specially if you can have a \"base\" station with an external keyboard and monitor for the maintenance work (installing software, tasks with lots of typing) and use the machine on the road as a very light and comfortable-to-carry replacement of your laptop, PDA and iPod.","The keyboard is not too much smaller than my other laptops \u0026 the USB, phone jacks etc are all placed along both sides instead of to the rear of the unit \u0026 there is an actual latch to lock down the top as opposed to the Averatec which just uses tension to hold the top down.Im pleased with this Toshiba so far.","It is very small, but the keyboard is of usable size and has a good feel to it (my old gateway notebook definitely had a bit of a flimsy feel to it).A few things:1) GET THE HIGH CAPACITY BATTERY.","Luckily I was able to figure out my own issues with this thing.The Ugly:-The letters wore off the keyboard within a month after using it! Trying to teach my boss how to use a computer and type on this is impossible.","The screen opens to only about 115 degrees (just past perpendicular to keyboard), which is not enough for when the LAPtop is on your LAP.","This upgraded Tecra M6 sure show\u0027s its potential! Pros: Solid build quality, excellent screen and keyboard, perfect out of the boxCons: Heavy, so-so battery life, features only \"average\" for the priceSummary: I really liked the keyboard, the feel of the keys being much better than most other low-priced machines, and the screen was very sharp and bright.","The 2 things that a bit poor are (1) touch pad is a bit difficult to use, the buttoms are too flat and the touch pad seems to sit inside, not easy to click (I am used to that littke button mouse at the middle of the keyboard): bought a wireless mouse, and solve that problem.","just wish it was a bit more powerful otherwise so far so good, only had it for a day.edited below at 7/17/2007:OK now I have had it for couple weeks and I have to say they do a great job, I was sceptical at first but now I\u0027m sold, these things are great, and the power is fine, I have not figured out how to change the stars but I like to change my review to a 5 star keyboard is full size.lightweightfull glass screenuser friendlygreat memoryI would recommend buying the Microsoft Office upgrade though.Other than that...you can\u0027t go wrong with this laptop.","This means that a single drop of water spilled on the keyboard can ruin it, resulting in the need for a very costly repair.","It feels like having a full desktop keyboard, yet It still fits the IBM ThinkPad Leather Case that I purchased for my T42 a few years back.I just purchased MS Virtual PC and plan to load XP Pro in one slice and continue to run the Vista Business in another.As for a new feature, the fingerprint reader is impressive.","Great keyboard feel.","I\u0027ve installed Linux on it and it works well now but I had the typical laptop problems: the \u0026quot;nousb\u0026quot; install option must be used to avoid keyboard freeze during installation; I had to deactivate pcmcia support which was freezing the boot (not fixed this yet b/c I don\u0027t need it); and, most frustrating, the ATI Radeon Mobility IGP 320M (U1) video card is virtually unknown by the kernel so I can\u0027t get any accelerated graphics in Linux...","The keyboard needs some time to get used to, but the keys are a pleasure to type on and very speedy (I do agree with the other person who said that they needed to expand the keyboard a bit and or put a keypad next to it since there is a large wasted space - but you have to also consider the components within).The only reason I did not buy the HP is because the cooling sucks... my friend has one (not the 17\" model though) and he needs an external fan to cool it.","They keyboard is perfect, screen a great size and clarity.I didn\u0027t like that it didn\u0027t come with back up disks and I had to pay to get them.","I had to send it in for warranty work for the keyboard and got it back in a week.","I have many add ons attached...printers, mice, game controllers, keyboards and pads, and speakers.I have upgraded my RAM to 1GB.","I believe all of you know that his laptop is fast and cool looking and has a strange feeling keyboard with a non-responsive spacebar corner.","It has an easy to use and functional keyboard.","So, contrary to the complaints in the other reviews, I actually think the keyboard is an improvement.The notebook does come with the options of \"Stamina\" and \"Speed\" performance.","If you want an ultraportable, I still recommend you look at the Panasonic W-2, which is even more stylish (I just love its circular, under-the-keyboard DVD loading), has a bigger screen and weighs less.","The keyboard, mouse, and even monitor can all be used with the PowerBook when I\u0027m at my desk.Who needs computer speakers when you can play iTunes through your home stereo (with an Airport Express in the mix).","Great screen, battery life, nice keyboard, wireless is perfect.BUTThe CPU will not run faster than 797MHZ on the one I bought, and HP admitted it is a flaw.","If you need to connect a PS/2 keyboard, mouse or a serial device, your out of luck.","After a second standard battery had to be replaced I asked for an \u0027extended life\u0027 battery and I\u0027m okay now.- As I\u0027m typing this, the \u0027N\u0027 key on the keyboard seems to sometime need to be hit with extra force to register a stroke.On the positive side, the black paint is not peeling off it, as it was the case with my prior IBM T40-something after 2.5 years of daily use.Do I still like my T60? You betcha but, I\u0027m afraid, this one won\u0027t last for the 4-year current company announced laptop lifecycle.","Thankfully, the speakers (situated above the keyboard) are good enough that it\u0027s not a huge deal.","FREEZE - When I first got it, I loved the keyboard volume controls - what innovation! But, when you have this feature, why not test it to see if it works? Freakin Gateway.","I use it daily with heavy multitasking and it still runs great! For someone who can spend a day easily taking 300-700 photo\u0027s at a time for download, editing and printing...I needed something that could easily travel with me, a wide screen for close-up detailed graphics, a hefty storage space, a unit capable of handling strong photo editing tools and a keyboard easy on the fingers for building documents.","Finally, the keyboard feel is pretty good, but I\u0027d prefer smaller keys like on most PC laptops.","Light, super fast, comfortable keyboard, ultra bright screen, and over 2-hour long battery life! No wonder this model is often out of stock.","However, I am at my wit\u0027s end with this darn keyboard problem and hope that Toshiba will either fix it right or allow me to exchange it! I have had this computer for over a year and I have had nothing but problems.","Pro:- Great device, but extremely basic- Does alot of basic stuff such as word, surfing the internet, and chat- nice and small, but leaves mark after long time use ( year or so)Con:- Expensive for the hardware- Macbook Pro would be alot better for best value Pro: made in Japan, no dead pixels, compact, eye candy, all drivers and user manuals available on support site, outer metal case, DVD write.Con: no recovery CD/DVD, worthless add-on applications, Norton Ghost not working on SATA h/d, expensive, tight keyboard, two fingers for PageUp/PageDown keys, useless slot for memory stick, BIOS with very basic menu.Creating a recovery dvd costs about thirty minutes.","But a messed up keyboard sours all of that.","Great notebook, it\u0027s plain and simple, yet stylish... i work with graphic design programs and haven\u0027t had any truble at all, runs any program smoothly and optimized, graphics look good and the system is fantastic! Turion 64 rules! Great notebook, very well built with nice materials, very light and with a great screen.The only thing is if you like shortcut buttons on the keyboard and close 2 it, don\u0027t buy this notebook, the keyboard is simple and clean there is no quick buttons for DVD play and sound control other then the function keyboard regular commands, so if you like just hitting 1 button to play your DVD or sliding your finger over a button to adjust sound volume, this is not for you, but, if you like clean, simple and very clean stylish looking, then buy this one.This notebook is very well built with no flaws to be noted.My overall is 5 out of 5, but that\u0027s because I rather have a clean working area with just the precise keyboard without a lot of buttons around it.","Now I have a notebook with dead pixels in the middle of the screen and it\u0027s very annoying.I would have loved to know this before buying this notebook, so I\u0027m passing this information to notebook buyers.Also sometime the pictures are incorrect.Hope it would help when buying a notebook i have bought 4 of these units and love them, great performance, not very much keyboard heating, light, great systemToshiba\u0027s Satellite M series notebooks are designed for multimedia and the M115-S3094 is a low cost system with media specific features.","You can always use an USB keyboard so I guess this is not a fatal problem but it sure is damned annoying.","They are moderately loud, but a review I saw recently made it sound like they were much louder.There is an issue with keyboard.","The LCD is sparkling clear, the keyboard is strong and quiet, the speakers are decent, clear (but a bit underpowered) and the software is great.","There is only a virtual keyboard, so you\u0027ll need to pick up an external one.","Because this system has integrated graphics, it should NOT be expected to blaze through graphic-intensive games or applications (e.g. CAD).Because this is a 12\" notebook, they had to shrink the keyboard a bit and get creative with the placement of keys.","For a company that resists a two-button mouse on the laptop because it\u0027s allegedly too complex, it\u0027s bizarre to build a keyboard that requires you to select 2 keys to do a forward delete or bring up a contextual menu, especially when the 4 modifier keys (fn, ctl, option, and apple) are all small and right next to each other.I didn\u0027t get an appreciation for these annoyances at the store.","The Hp zd7010us has a numeric keypad to the right of the normal keyboard, so it is easy to enter numbers.","I have not once taken it in for a tune-up, repair, inspection, ect.The only minor hindrances are as follows:The keyboard doesn\u0027t light up which makes typing in the dark difficult.For some reason my hard-drive is almost full so everytime I search for something in the search bar, it runs really slow.It doesn\u0027t use an IBM processor so I guess you can say it is a true blood mac, which makes some programs incompatible.Now the good stuff:I actually think that if you consider it was made 5 years ago, it is a better computer than what apple makes now.","Recent benchmarks that I have read of comparable Acer systems leave the MPB as a clear contender even when running Windows XP.The backlit keyboard, iSight, the remote control are just extras that put icing on the cake.","Bluetooth allows you to use a cell phone in a pinch to connect to the net as well as for peripherals like mouse and keyboard.","Controls are intuitive and the keyboard good, and a few interfaces like Firewire, S-Video out (but not in), and a switch for turning wireless off are nice.The bad stuff overwhelms this, though.","You can drag/click and drag/right-click across the whole screen without contorting your hands or wrists into carpal tunnel syndrome candidates.The keyboard is good, very good - good action on the keys, tactile feedback, and relatively easy to clean.It\u0027s wonderfully solid.","The only components I have replaced so far was the keyboard (went through two from overuse) and one of the touch pad buttons (wore out from overuse again), and that\u0027s it.","I will only discuss my personal experience with a laptop I still love and I would very much miss if it had to be replaced with some other brand.I still like my Thinkpad, mainly because of its design simplicity and because of the little red mouse-emulator knob in the middle of the keyboard.","This computer is fast, quiet, has a great display and lots of extras that only Apple delivers, like:- The magnetic power cord that prevents you from pulling your computer off your desk, table, or tray table.- The DVI connector that allows you to use your flat panel monitor at full resolution as an extension of the built-in display.- A backlit keyboard that helps you see the keys in dim light.- A built-in camera that let\u0027s you take pictures of yourself for web sites, passports, etc.- The ability to create PDFs from almost any file without buying Acrobat Pro.- Built-in address book, email, calendar, web site builder, music simulator, movie editor, etc.- And more that I\u0027ve forgotten.In fairness, I did have a problem with this computer - bad memory - that caused me to take it for an overnight stay at my local Mac shop.","Compared to the keyboard on my old IBM A31, the keyboard sucks.","Product had dead pixels, and the space bar key does not enter spaces unless pressed EXACTLY in the middle!HD full of trial software and self promoting programs that need clean up.Lacks Blue Tooth \u0026 IR connectivity, or CF card slot (mentioned in Tech Spec, but would have been a nice feature).Otherwise a great system for $1100 or less.Buyer beware...Addendum: Out of warranty, but keyboard fixed gratis by Toshiba.","After that the computer worked two more years then stopped working, but it was out of warranty and literally falling apart (the keyboard popped up in places) so I went to a neighborhood store and bought a $600 Toshiba, which has worked great for the last four years and also has way better quality sound and graphics than the Thinkpad, the tradeoff being that it does weigh more.The x61 I bought is less than a year old, and the hard drive is now nonfunctional.","I would recommend trying one first at a Best Buy or circuit city.Pros:- Attractive design - thinner and more eye-pleasing than M35/M35X predecessor- Exceptional sound from built-in speakers, though deeper bass is lacking- Quiet keyboard with easy-to-depress keys, though see issues below- TruBrite display produced excellent images- Touchpad is smooth and has good tactile feel- Sonoma platform with 533MHz FSB- Solid WiFi performance- Wide array of connectivity options: 3 USB 2.0 ports, FireWire, SD/MMC/xD/MS/MS Pro Media Card slot- Very quiet and cool to the touch - fan came on rarely and made a pleasant sound when running- Toshiba power management and system management software: Touch and Launch, Acoustic Silencer, graphical WiFi utility- S-Video (TV Out) for connection to projectors and TVsCons:- TruBrite display exhibits lots of glare, though this is common on nearly all glossy LCD\u0027s- Lacks DVI output and Express Card- Display exhibits too much flex and seems fragile- Poor 3D performance due to integrated graphics and shared memory- Below Average Battery life- Slower 333MHz DDR memory rather than newer 533MHz DDR2 memory, though lower latency (CL 2.5) generally compensates for slower speed- Keyboard seems slightly cramped and is shifted to the right rather than centered; dedicated Windows key is inconveniently located in upper-right area of keyboard- Relatively low-resolution 1280 x 800 display (98 PPI), though TruBrite has good color \u0026 contrast I bought this machine a little over a month ago, it replaced my Powerbook G3 1.5 Ghz.","Keyboard has a numeric keypad on the right.3.","Both lack the PC Card (PCMCIA) slot but can accommodate AirPort Extreme wireless network.Other than faster G4 processor, just about the only reasons to consider 12\" PowerBook are:- Larger memory capacity on the PowerBook (1.25 GB vs. 640 MB)- Larger hard disk (40 GB vs. 30 GB)- PowerBook can drive an external display (dual display) up to 2048-by-1536 via DVI port; iBook can only mirror up to 1024-by-768 via VGA port- SuperDrive (DVD burner) is optional on PowerBook; it is not available on iBook- Bluetooth is standard on PowerBook; it is optional (built-to-order) on iBook- Marginally faster GeForce FX 5200 graphics card on PowerBook (vs. Radeon 9200 on iBook)- PowerBook is slightly lighter (4.6 lbs vs. 4.9 lbs) and slightly smaller (10.9-by-8.6-by-1.18 inches vs. 11.2-by-9.1-by-1.35 inches)- You like the PowerBook\u0027s anodized aluminum allow chassis betterThere are sufficient reasons to get the iBook instead:- Costs almost 50% less- It is not dramatically slower- Longer battery life (up to 6 hours vs. 5 hours)- Polycarbonate plastic chassis is more scratch proof and offer better wireless network (AirPort Extreme) receptionHow is the iBook in itself? For a little over a grand, you get a beautifully designed notebook (similar to iPod) packed with features: combo CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive, optional 802.11g AirPort Extreme wireless network, beautiful LCD, sensible keyboard layout, snappy performance under included Mac OS X Panther 10.3 -- all in very portable form factor.","I also have to beat the keyboard to get the letters to pick up.","To any one who carries a laptop this is the one for you and in the night or dark areas ,perfect with the lighted keyboard .I cannot comment on its performance but based on looks and what my son says , this is the laptop to get .","The keyboard is very easy to use and I have had no problems with it.","Suggest a plastic cover for screen to keep oils from hands/keyboard off the screen.Don\u0027t waste money on the Sony privacy filter.","The keyboard keys pop off or stick often.","I\u0027m having a hard time adjusting to the slightly smaller, and slightly different keyboard.","Easily the worst keyboard I have used on laptops.","The design sensibly omits com, midi, mouse, keyboard and printer ports in favor of 3 USB2 ports.","Here are the highlights:1) Really bad keyboard.","It\u0027s even harder to see the keyboard when you have a big, pregnant stomach in the way and cannot have it close to your face.","The keyboard is fine for small jobs.","I would have perferred if the 10-key was removed and a larger keyboard was available.Bottomline: This is my first Toshiba, it was good but did not awe me.","So bright that I have it turned all the way down and it\u0027s still pretty darned bright.Negatives:-Avera-who?

Dont you hate Windows when you want to Uninstall a Program? most times it wont even let you and others i guarantee you are leaving plenty of trackers to your computer behind when you think you have deleted it.","I love this computer - the screen is amazing (perfect for watching and editing movies or working with photos), the keyboard is comfortable (the keys make a little clicking noise that is quite pleasant), and the speakers are outstanding.","The QuickPlay media and DVD buttons are easy to accidentally press when you\u0027re using the keyboard.","The keyboard is great, the CPU is FAST MORE THAN ENOUGH ram.","The keyboard is a little cramped.","It\u0027s lighter than its predecessor, with a generously sized keyboard (though I do miss a right CTRL key and keep hitting the @#$% Ins key! The complement of ports (3 USB 2.0 and one Firewire, plus IR, S-Video and a legacy parallel port) and features is ideal for me.","I\u0027ve spilled water, pop, and tea on it, shook it upside down in a panic (without turning it off), have crumbs of every possible food group stuck in the keyboard and touchpad, dropped it out of my car and off my shoulder several times (zipped in a cruddy $19 Targus case), and it still manages to work.The Harman/Kardon speakers are surprisingly loud and clear for a laptop and it\u0027s fine for throwing onto the end of the bed and watching a movie.","Other laptops made it around the world with me, whereas this laptop did not make it off the local metro without the LCD going because of the design fault.A key came loose, and since the screen had not catch it lodged between the keyboard and screen until it smashed the screen.Sony intended to charge me in full for this, but later settled to 70%.","V. clear screen and keyboard is novel with a 5degree smile.","The keyboard feels very solid.2.","This is unlike the Sharp MM20 which sacrifices speed for long battery life, or the X505 which costs two arms and two legs.If Sony can address the keyboard issues this would be the perfect laptop for all my mobile needs.","Don\u0027t do this but last week I accidently spilled half a cup of water on the keyboard and pretty much thought I killed my computer.","In fact, you just can\u0027t hear it when you\u0027re typing.- The full size keyboard is also a plus.","Perhaps an external keyboard when not on the road would make it almost perfect! I bought my T40 used and didn\u0027t pay the typically high IBM pricetag, however I have been extremely impressed with this notebook.","I have had this computer for one year now and have just had the keyboard replaced for THE THIRD TIME! In desperation, I started reading reviews for this laptop.I have now seen that the keyboard is a consistent problem.","By far better than my Macbook pro\u0027s iSight)- 1 1.x Mega Pixels integrated camera on the back intended to take picture and it even has a \"capture\" button but... the software leaves something to be desired.- Biometric reader which beyond letting you login to windows, it\u0027s supposed to be used as your password assistance everywhere... i can\u0027t make it work the way it should...- Integrated mouse and keyboard.- 1 USB 2.0 port- Microphone and headphones ports- Memory Stick DUO PRO port- Dock Port- Integrated wireless lan, Bluetooth and EDGE wan technology (the same sloooooooooooow service you get on a GSM phone like iPhone when out of Europe to connect to the internet, UMTS should be better but.","I got the HP a few years ago after trying a lot of laptops, because I liked the keyboard feel (I typed without looking on many keyboards and the HP had the fewest keyboard-caused typos) and I found the text sharp.","The screen and keyboard are great.","The keyboard is closer to a full size desktop keyboard than most smaller laptops.","The keyboard remains pretty cool to touch, too.","The keyboard, for instance, is particularly sensitive, and the processing lag from the i440 processor doesn\u0027t seem to help it along, either.","(or buy a USB universal docker...the one I bought doesn\u0027t like the keyboard).","VERY DURABLE considering its been dropped a time or two by my 2 year old and myself.Two great improvements over my last Thinkpad(which I still have, its over 5 years old)-\"Night light\" for the keyboard BUILT IN, no need for an additional laptop light to see when typing on a dark airplane, in bed @ night, etc.-Touchpad AND pointer-- IBM has finally integrated both.","I accidentally dropped ash from my cigarette on the keyboard and its still ok!(Duh)I am just concerned about1.)","I did not want a repeat of the graphics card failure, so I ended up putting the laptop on a wire dish-rack ($5 in the housewares section of your local discount store)and it lifted the laptop enough to give adequate ventilation.Also, the power supply is a huge brick, and the battery life is terrible, not surprising for a 17\" laptop with a desktop-type processor, but I mention this because the laptop itself is heavy, and if you plan to travel with it occasionally, the power supply is going to add weight.Also, I had wanted a 17\" laptop because I wanted a separate numeric keypad built into the laptop - the ZD7010us delivered and I really liked the keyboard - great feel and good key placement and size -- much better than the DV9910us I am using to write this review.","Talk about monopoly.* word of advice if you still decide to buy this great computer: put a cheesecloth or papertowel over the keyboard when you have the Powerbook closed.","The Toshiba A55-S306 is a great all around notebook for the price.The keyboard has a good touch.","The keyboard is cramped.","I\u0027m used to a keyboard where the keys are raised, and narrow towards the top.","Its got everything you need.The only thing that I would change would be the keyboard sometimes acts up a bit, but no big deal.","Both models have the same sized keyboards.","But after 2 years my dardisk, keyboard and battery was damaged.","Fast, little and furious !!!! I\u0027d like at all this great notebook !!!! The finger reader this very usefull and the imprint finish is wonderful !!! I\u0027ll buy another one to my wife !!! Go HP Go !!!! Fast,lots of storage, great xbrite widescreen, looks great (wide and thin), nice keyboard, vaio zone.Battery life is just adequate, speakers not best in class, limited portability but better than most in class.","The video card is not suitable for windows vista, also if want it working properly you must put it 4gb ram, plus a new hardrive spinning at 7200 RPM, or it works very slow, also the processor runs extremely hot and at 2,2 ghz it can barely keep up, the touchscreen feature is so inacurrate that is not useful (they should develop something like multitouch of machintosh). the wide screen is great for watching movies or t.v. and the flip up keyboard not only saves space but keeps it clean from dust.","It is fast, not heavy (one pound lighter than my old Dell 15\") and hardly gets hot even when doing difficult tasks like encoding video (which was a major problem with my old Dell).Some minor things I think that may need some improvement are: the very small shift-button on the right side of the keyboard, always needing to check if the notebook is really closed, need to give it an extra push; everything else is just perfect.Now about the support.","I have had this computer for only two days so far but it plays movies really well is fast on start-ups, keyboard types nicely, the screen is bright and seems large for the size, and the wireless system seems to work really well.","The keyboard is very lovely, and the finish on this machine is spectacular.","Second, the edges of the keyboard are rather sharp, and can irritate your wrists when you\u0027re typing.","The keyboard is a bonus, great for short emails and passwords.","I suggest that new user of ibook check the keyboard.","Probably the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because as far as I can tell, keyboard backlighting was not included with this model.","A remote would make it nice to use as part of an entertainment center.By the way, Amazon\u0027s specs aren\u0027t quite accurate - This laptop has 2 120gb hard drives for a total of 240gb, not 200gb.Another nice touch about this laptop is that this laptop\u0027s keyboard includes a separate area for a numeric keypad, which is nice - many laptops have a smaller keyboard with the numeric keypad where the letters are.Another thing I like about this laptop is that the HDMI output allows you to connect to modern high-definition TVs, and with an HDMI-DVI adapter, you can use a PC monitor with a digital connection.This laptop comes with Windows Vista installed.","The keyboard is fine as is the speed of the CPU.","Not only is it big and ugly and plastic with ports on every side of it, but it has horrible ergonomics (a weird keyboard with narrower keys that are not the standard size and a horrible set of mouse buttons) and a typical but still cheesy optical drive that you have to slide out and then snap the disc onto the spindle.","the keyboard fit is so tight that if it is placed in a little off, your keys will stick a little on one side- It does nick and scratch, beware- Open and close with both hands, or the screen will get a permanent lighter shade where pressure is applied.","I wasn\u0027t a fan of touchpads, but this one has a good feel to it, along with the keyboard.","Nice ergonomics and cool white keyboard.","It is time to put an LCD and keyboard on your rack mount computers because that is what it will take to keep up with this machine\u0027s number crunching power.- The Wi-Fi capabilities might as well not be there.","I have not noticed (I guess that\u0027s good) the effectiveness of the spill-resistant keyboard.","The keyboard is simply the best of any notebook computer I have used.","Aside from that, I\u0027ve used this computer for all of eight years and while heavy, it\u0027s extremely reliable.The wireless, Gigabit Ethernet, CD-RW/DVD-RW drive works great, keyboard, LCD panel, front audio controls and everything else.The only thing that I\u0027ve had to buy for the system for replacement was a new battery (about $35) and a new power supply (about $45) a couple years ago.","The extra battery clips on in such a way as to provide a slightly angled keyboard; exactly what you want for long periods of use.The only caveats I have are as follows.","There\u0027s a set of buttons above the keyboard which is supposed to let you operate the machine as a dumb-terminal personal DVD player without booting up the whole system, but it\u0027s never worked 100% properly for me.","Visually - same thing.What makes it useless is that the keyboard stops functioning in BRAND NEW OUT OF THE BOX machines.","Operating speed is great! Finds wireless hotspots and other wireless signals with no problems.When talking with the Geek Squad guys at Best Buy, they say that most people have problems with their cd/dvd drive and keyboards because they are very hard on their equipment.","I have no issues with the screen (Matte - LG panel).Pros:- Mac OS X- Great preinstalled software package you don\u0027t have to waste your time with uninstalling the junk like on a windows laptop.- Size / Weight compared to other 15.4 laptops- everything regarding to the operation - fast, quiet, illuminating keyboard, magsafe power adapter ...- multiple options to install other operating system - I have Bootcamp / XP on it I only use it for my games.- I found all the other softwares that I needed for Mac.- wide range of custom designed accessories - you can spend a fortune on these :-)Cons:- only 2 USB ports- no multimedia card reader- no docking possibility- can be hot - I would recommend iLap that will solve the problem- fingerprint reader would be nice on a $2500 laptopMy conclusion:I don\u0027t take away stars for the cons because I knew all these things before I ordered my MBP and there weren\u0027t unexpected problems.","In the meantime I replaced it with the 13.3\" Durabook and that is working fine.My observations from my brief time with the N15RI are: I liked the keyboard (others have complained about it,but I found it to have a nice feel), screen is adequate, I liked that it came with very little preloaded software to clutter it up (pretty much just XP, IE, Intel wifi and Norton), As others have commented it did run VERY HOT, and as the fan is on the bottom (?) anything underneath (including your lap) gets scorched (could this have something to do with the failure?).","The only solution to this problem would be to move the keyboard forward.As a final note, unless you\u0027re doing extensive graphics work, my opinion is that you\u0027ll get more bang for the buck by getting the black 13\" MacBook.","The USB port in the rear of the machine was at best, really for connecting a USB keyboard or hardware, for instance.","This computer family has the best keyboard, by far, of any laptop keyboard.","Screen/keyboard has very tight fit.","In addition, Toshiba keyboards have a mushy feel.","The Sony keyboard is just too small for my fingers.","Good buy Dell laptop features large screen view capacity, easy lay keyboard, room to upgrade/expansion and an excellent 5 star customer service and tech support.","Desktops consist of the keyboard, the monitor itself, the mouse, and other accessories.","the keyboard typing drawback is just like a high fashioned beautiful young woman wearing broken 4 inches high heels shoes.","I have not experienced any problems with the keyboard buttons, but my solution is simple- ALWAYS purchase a service plan that goes beyond the manufacturer\u0027s warranty.","Apple computers have always had a great reputation, but do they live up to expectations? Are they as good and as compatible as they claim to be?I bought my IBOOK 14\" in Mexico City, but it is the same model as the U.S.A. model.Technical specifications:- iBOOK 14\"- 1.42 GHz PowerPC G4 Processor- 1 Gb of RAM (I added 512Mb)- 60 Gb Hard Drive- Super Drive (DVD \u0026 CD burner)- English keyboard- Bluetooth and Wireless Internet (Airport Extreme) included- MAC OS TIGER 10.4.2OPERATING SYSTEMIt\u0027s a breeze to use.","The average is if you use the laptop daily, you will start having problems with your keyboard in about 1 year.I am not saying that the rest of the computer is bad, but I believe Dell is making a lot of monye just selling keyboards for $25.00GOOD TIP:\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dIf you want to know if your laptop has a WEAK keyboard, just go to ebay and look for its keyboard... if you find MANY of them, it means that it has a weak keyboard and will fail some keys in 1 year or less.","I usually write whith an AZERTY keyboard, and I think to know that US keyboards are QWERTY.","First off, the computer looks and feels great; the keyboard, touchpad, and ports all have a solid, sturdy feel to them, and look beautiful to boot.","The keyboard is also very robust (I\u0027m a \"hard typer\" and typically wear through keyboards in a year - this one\u0027s never needed any work) and the Sony warranty is a good one (I fried a motherboard two months into owning it - replacement was quick and easy.)CONS: Like seemingly all Vaios, it feels a little fragile - lots of plastic.","The media drive is slot loading, and the Airport Extreme network card tucks discreetly under the keyboard.","I\u0027m not sure why Sony decided to ship this otherwise perfect model with such a crappy keyboard, although you\u0027ll eventually get used to it after a week.","I bought the docking station, which came with a wireless keyboard and mouse.","Apart from that, the keyboard is now sturdier, with the keys staying in place better than the G3\u0027s.","By the way, Go Blue! I was origninally concerned with the small screen size, however for traveling purposes, it is fantastic and very portable!! the screen size is perfect and still very easy to use the keyboard.","Keyboard opinions are largely subjective, but I really like this one.* The laptop is extremely light.","Doesn\u0027t have that annoying cursor thing in the middle of the keyboard that some people like to use.","Compared to my old laptop, the Averatec weighs half as much and is much more compact; that said, the keyboard and screen are both still very usable.","Problems with the spacebar have been well documented...all in all, the build quality has basic design faults despite the beautiful screen and efficient processors etc.Given that the new Core 2 range also use these keyboards, one couldn\u0027t recommend VAIO SZ\u0027s as long as the keyboard is made so cheaply.","The keys are leveled with the surface and are a lot harder to type (even with small fingers) that on smaller Blackberry keyboards with true keys.","I like the keyboard feel and the display is good in comparision to my older Toshiba laptop.","It\u0027s good enough for my needs, and the only thing I at all miss is the backlit keyboard.","I\u0027m so fickle - hence me balancing a multitude of ladies.When I got the box, I opened the package and made sure I kept the insert between the monitor and keyboard.","It\u0027s a laptop folks, if your gonna own one chances are VERY good that your gonna have to get it fixed from time to time, as the person who payed $700+ can attest.About the laptop itself it is a very handy unit but one that is best used as a companion pc to a large notebook or desktop because trying to type on it is a pain, both because of the small keyboard and the small screen.As to battery life if you don\u0027t charge the battery for a good 12 hours the first time you use it you\u0027ll get poor performance.","Keyboard has wonderful feel/action to it.My only gripe(which may be fixable,but I haven\u0027t found a solution) which is that the USB ports will stop functioning when book is closed.","I don\u0027t use the numpad that much, but when I do need to type numbers, its much better than using the numbers at the top of the keyboard.","The keyboard is small - but that\u0027s kind of the point.","For those who are not familiar with it, this new feature in Panther will allow you to push F9 on the keyboard and show every window that is open.",". .I\u0027m glad to see that the reviews here on amazon seem to be from actual AirBook owners as opposed to those reviews I\u0027ve found elsewhere that are heavily weighed down by people who don\u0027t even own it.The biggest complaints seem to be price and lack of optical drive.In regards to price I don\u0027t really see the issue highly portable laptops are ALWAYS priced at a premium and the similar offering on the PC side (The Sony Vaio VZ that appears to have ripped off the MacBook\u0027s keyboard design) starts @ $2,199 for a 1.2GHz processor with a Hard Drive that is only 20GB bigger.","And with the most common plan at $80 a month, it\u0027s a bit pricy.The screen is exceptional for its size, and the keyboard works as well as can be expected in such a small space.","Possesses a big keyboard so it feels like a desktop computer.5.","This laptop is incredible!

As a recovering PC-user, I can tell you that I\u0027m glad I switched and I\u0027ll never switch back!

Going on....","The fan is also starting to fail, but again, it\u0027s due to dirt and grime.With the one persons comment about the keyboard keys wearing off, and then saying they\u0027re going to get an IBM, (Lenovo), at one of the MWR\u0027s, (internet centers), almost all the keys have worn off, guess what, they\u0027re IBM\u0027s.","The backlight keyboard only stinks because it keeps me up to late in to the night.","All-in-all, the 15\" Powerbook has become the best value in the line-up.With a 15\" Powerbook only $500 more than the 12\" Powerbook, the features are worth the extra money.Features added to 15\" Powerbook over the 12\" Powerbook include;

About the \"keys of the keyboard problem\"...If you have owned a Toshiba before that, it will feel unusual the first 2-3 times, after that you get used to the feel of the buttons...But honestly, after a Sony Vaio VGNB 100BD and a Toshiba M35-s405...this notebook is a monster! :))) Best laptop I have ever owned.","Especially untouted stuff, like the far better keyboard - the magnetic power connector - the Widget gadget - the Spotlight - and the Safari.","After just a week now, the keyboard is again dead.","Battery Life: With WiFi active but with out use of cd-rom (2 hrs 10mins)Recharge Time: Approximately 2 hours.Cool looking machine, light, reasonably well sized keyboard, great looking screen (Indoors).Battery life on the low side of the spectrum but you always have the option of getting a 12 cell battery for much longer battery life (I have already purchased the 12cell battery and get approx.","But the pad is there, and you don\u0027t have to use the eraser shaped head in the middle of the keyboard if you don\u0027t want to.","I was worried at first but Lenovo has carried the Thinkpad torch superbly into the production of the T60 model.PROS:-Build quality is second to none.-Integrates MS Office Applications easily into hardware.-Super long battery life and high performance options.-Great tactile keyboard and you can buy a keyboard in various languages and type fonts.-All the parts are easily user removable, user replaceable, and user serviceable!-Great customer support at Lenovo!-Unique features like waterproof keyboard, airbag, roll cage, fingerprint security, Thinkpad manager, etc...-SXGA and UXGA resolution screens!-Quiet dust proof fan.CONS:- No SD or Memory Card slots but you can easily buy a PC adapter card.- Runs hot on surfaces like beds and cushions and fan is not super quiet when laptop is hot.- Video Memory options are scant on the T60 models.","The keyboard takes a little getting used to, but then again most notebook keyboards do.","I especially like the 1.7 ghz processor, the 80 gb hd, and the DVD burner.- Pen writes very well.- Screen resistant to scratches.- Good looking.- Well-designed keyboard; responsive and smooth, keys well laid out.- Good screen resolution.- Expandable memory (I added another 512 mb to make a full gb: helps a lot!).- Customizable power settings.","First view is great design/color; light weight, functional built in camera! After using you discover; plastic casing parting in front seam,keyboard loose on left side, and fan inefficient at cooling system.","It might seem that with current state of the art you could find some tiny speakers and hide them somewhere in the keyboard of screen.","The keyboard is well laid out.","With the similar price, the Sony one has more features, eg. two cameras while OQO doesn\u0027t have one, the Sony one has better resolution, 1024x600 while the OQO only 800x400, the Sony one has a keyboard more closed to standard keyboard, Sony one has memory stick slot.","I like Sony because they typically make the very lightest laptops available, the keyboards have a smooth action, and the design/style of the products are usually \u0026quot;cool\u0026quot; looking.This laptop was an exception.","On a positive note the LCD is beautifull, great keyboard and design, Nice Sony software package.","Regardless of full size keyboard and decent feel, it is not very solid.","Why? Mainly because it\u0027s fun to use, has a decent dedicated graphics processor and keyboard (despite the key placement), and I\u0027ll have to spend hundreds more to get what this laptop already gives me.","Everything else, great! Great computer, does exactly you expect from it! No probs with the airport, Love the keyboard and the overall slick look.","Try to get a keyboard protector, the letters on the keys (not the actual keys) start coming off after use and abuse.","If you are a touch typist who\u0027s never used a 90%-sized keyboard, you might be unhappy with the size, at least in the beginning.Performance is snappy on this laptop despite the many plug-ins it comes with; the new processor with its enormous L2 cache and the generous amount of RAM surely help.","Its very quiet and the keyboard is very smooth and nice.","Toshiba even went so far as to have at least one sample keyboard protector made for the P105 line but they failed to have any made available to customers.I have done battle with Toshiba over this obvious problem, which required the writing of several letters and the filing of a Better Business Bureau complaint.","At first, I did not quite like the fact that you have to open up the keyboard to upgrade RAM, but then once you figure it out, it is fine (despite the manual saying \"contact Toshiba service person to do it\").","One review I saw online mentioned that the keyboard was poor--very little key travel and the layout being poorly designed.","HOWEVER!!! I have found a small bluetooth keyboard that doesn\u0027t just fold...it accordians to very tiny.","The keyboard is COMPLETELY useless.","Computer keyboards (be they desktops or laptops) last and last and last... which explains my disappointment with my Pavilion (especially because it will cost me real money to have the R, N, M keys fixed.","The keyboard is slightly different but you quickly adapt.Its quick and quiet.","But that was the only major issue, so far, hopefully! The keyboard needs a little getting used to.","The graphics and visuals are absolutely breathtaking, the light up keyboard is really nice, the overall craftsmanship of this computer is beautiful and such a step up from the regular macbook.","I have had this laptop for 8 months now and ive never had an issue with the so called \u0026quot;hotspot.\u0026quot; The computer runs great except for the fact that the touchpad freezes occassionally (not the computer, but only the pointer because keyboard can still control the computer).","The keyboard is very easy to use and I can use the touch pad like a pro already(I thought I might need a mouse but really, I don\u0027t).","Reviewers all over the place have indulged in what it can and not, I just want to share some pluses and minuses with youPLUS:- For a midsize widescreen laptop relatively light and thin- a bright and glossy display- nice design- available in many configurations (1GB Ram and core2duo recommended, for Vista at least 2GB RAM and a rambo-style graphics adapter)MINUSES:- loud keyboard (that\u0027s where it pays off to get a thinkpad)- no thinkpoint/intellipoint navigation stick (damnit)- a little louder than expected from a 2007 laptop computer- warms up easily under heavy duty- display works like a pretty good mirror- the screen resolution could be higher- no bluetooth- 1 GB RAM spread over two slots 512meg each, bummerAll in all, a decent workhorse, that doesn\u0027t compare to a similarly equipped Thinkpad T series for example, but then again, it costs almost 400 bucks less than such one.","Just remember: the battery life has limitations, the keyboard is not nearly as solid feeling as Dell\u0027s and HP\u0027s (but is nicely sized), and the appearance is pretty \u0027square\u0027 in all respects.","If the keyboard is not an issue for you, I highly recommend this machine.Some of the other features I don\u0027t use as much: the fingerprint reader is a neat gadget and it works well enough once you get used to it, and get the method down, but it was just something to mess with for me.","Has 2 Ctrl and 2 Alt keys, in contrast to many laptops keyboards I know.","My most favorite feature on the keyboard itself is the handy row of buttons at the top, volume included.","The edge of the case in front of the keyboard is sharp and cuts off the circulation in your wrists.","If the device was always cool to the touch and you could set it on your lap I would have given it 5 stars, but alas, such is not the case.If you are like me and will be using the MBP as a primary device at a desk or workstation, I highly suggest buying a secondary keyboard and a mouse for it.","I\u0027ve had my Presario for a year and a half now and I\u0027ll provide you with my experiences...Keyboard - I love the feel of a good crisp keyboard.","Why not move the keyboard closer to the front of the computer, where your hands don\u0027t obscure part of the screen?Touchpad: One button mice are passe.","Keyboard at first look seems unusual, but after a few hours, it think that it does stand out from usual crowd.","It will not be enough to efficiently run your programs and that could cost $100+ anway since you can\u0027t install it by just opening up your keyboard panel.It does get VERY hot after extended use, but this doesn\u0027t seem to affect performance, well except for the burning on the legs.And one more silly complaint, the plug base is huge (not the part the plugs into the computer but the other end).","As far as the laptop goes, I love the keyboard as compared to other notebooks.","Great keyboard.","Like the screen and keyboard layout but processor is slow.","Occasionally the feature intended to run a DVD without turning on the hard drive (very handy) would freeze up, but other than that, wonderful! Good battery life, good graphics, nice screen, handy remote, pretty good speakers, nice keyboard, held up well when transported, and not too heavy.","I did have a keyboard replaced, and I bumped up the memory to 512mb, but this is one solid computer.","This computer rocks! Athlon 64! Very cool, no problems with heat and have had it on my lap for 3+ hrs! Nice keyboard/trackpad.","The keyboard will bend when pressed on in some areas, especially under the \"QWER\" and the \"UIOP\" sections.","Or that the keyboard was cheaply manufactured.","You can always upgrade to a 9 cell battery and/or take out the DVD-burner and stick in an extra battery there.Opening up the T60 is also easy, and allowable under the warranty to some extent - for example, adding RAM or replacing the keyboard (replacement keyboards are shipped overnight!)I also like the matte-ish finish off the laptop cover as well as the screen.","keyboard has a good layout and the keys feel durable.","I was file sharing in minutes!The backlit keyboard is sooo cool.","The processor is fast, the machine is compact, light and slick-looking, while Mac OS X is rock-stable.The keyboard is my real gripe; 2 days old and the it needs to be replaced as the \"chicklet keys\" are wobbly and the click-bar below the track pad is variably responsive at the edges.","I still have an Inspiron 700m which I already replaced its keyboard twice in 3 years.","The keyboard is significantly bigger (how\u0027d they do that?), but also has considerably more flex in the center.The next impression was the brightness of the display.","The keyboard layout is a bit awkward; the space key is very short and the placement of the Ctrl, Fn and Del keys are not standard.","i love being able to lay in bed and watch dvds, and sitting down for a few rounds of army ops. the 2 finger scrolling is awesome, and the keyboard feels very durable under your fingers.the tiger operating system is quite possibly the easiest operating system to use.","It has a nice, easy-to-use finger pad, and well-defined keys; I have found that the keyboard is over-sensitive, however.","I play Warcraft regularly and its solid performance embarasses our brand new maxed-out MacBooks and even some older desktops I\u0027ve seen.The base area does get extremely hot when in that kind of intense performance usage - hot enough to burn someone unaware of the issue.The keyboard is unique.","This increases the resemblance of this keyboard to that a normal one (except for the absence of the numeric keypad).7.","The keyboard is wonderful (and I like the backlighting).Testing out iDVD was fun.","After downloading the user manual from the Averatec website, I found out that this laptop has a button (above the regular keyboard) that you have to push to activate the internal wireless connection, probably to help save battery power.","I am typing with the back of the stylus and bought one of those flexible keyboards to pack if I am planning to do any serious typing.","Most people don\u0027t type as much as I do, but as a writer, I really pound the keyboard, so five of my letters are no longer legible.All in all, this has been my favorite Mac, because it travels with me everywhere I go, and it has been very reliable.","The keys do take some getting use to and theres always a foldup usb keyboard for those with big fingeres.","The keyboard is too small for comfort, but I bought the Logitech Wireless Desktop from Amazon for 29.99.","The keyboard also wore out pretty fast.","Is it possible to change keyboard\u0027s language? On Apple website, we also can choose MacOs language.","The plastic surrounding the keyboard bows up around the power button.","The keyboard and mouse are hard to use and the mousepad in particular is not very sensitive (another common failing of laptops in general).","The portions above the keyboard have gotten hot, but not hot enough that I couldn\u0027t touch it.","The computer seems to be built specifically for this operating system.Upon setting up, I have been able to plug it directly into my entertainment center, I am using it like a TIVO, watching on demand movies through the Internet, and all this while playing online multiplayer video games.So far, no problems.One other nice feature is that it is somewhat compact, comes with a nearly fullsized keyboard, and has a built-in wireless card.While I could find far more portable laptops with ease, this is more like a compact PC in the size of a 9lb laptop.I tend to use it stationary, but have been known to pick it up and take it with me on the road.Hope this helps.","Dimension 5150 With Intel Pentium D 820 Processor | 1024MB PC4200 DDR2 Memory | 160GB SATA Hard drive | DVD+-R/RW CD-R/RW Burner | ATI X1300 Pro PCI Express 256MB Video Card | 8 X USB2.0 | 1 X Ethernet | USB Keyboard and Mouse | Windows XP Media Center 2005 No recovery media | Ready to install New Vista Operating system | New 450Watt Antec Power supply | 5.1 Sigmatel audio | Questions Email meThis is the specs i have on my dell and with this specs it runs smoothly on all games also ATI graphics card i have is made for VISTA Aero Feature.","The keyboard is flat and takes a bit of getting used to, but I love it.All in all, well worth the price.","Though you can increase the font for the latter two, we now come to a discussion of the keyboard.I waited a month to write this in part because I wanted to see if I could adjust to the keyboard.","Not sure how it compares to any comparably priced PCs (I guess that\u0027d kinda be a high end model), but I feel like the ease of interface and keyboard shortcuts lessen operator time, regardless of processor speed.","The machine awakens now on opening the case or a keyboard click.","My current laptop from Averatec has the same keyboard, sort of a tad wider, flatter key pads than normal.","If you do a lot of typing beware of the 95%-sized keyboard.","The keyboard isn\u0027t laid out wrong, rather it\u0027s different from what I\u0027m used to.","My wife has sent hers in twice as well.We are totally sick of the hours we have wasted with their customer support pretending that the issues we are experiencing are something they\u0027ve never heard of when their are websites dedicated to these Macbook problems.So after spending a lot of money on the laptops we\u0027ve finally come to accept our keyboards occasionally not working, trouble waking from sleep, but just recently both our screens have started flickering...","I have attached an external keyboard for now (till I figure out how to open it and see what the problem is), so it is working like a desktop for me..Other problems are of course the poor battery life, the difficulty in clicking the keyboard mouse keys, the time taken to connect to a wireless network, and of course the heavy weight.I would never recommend Sony Vaio to my friends and colleagues.Maybe we can initiate some action against Sony if there is a generic problem with their keyboard on Vaios? Just love the MacBook.","At leastit has a keyboard and cost only $399.","They\u0027re small ones, of course, and there is no subwoofer, so bass is still lacking, but the sound is pretty decent.One nice feature is a set of controls for volume, mute, and playing DVDs or CDS, right above the keyboard, so you don\u0027t have to use software for all of those functions if you don\u0027t want to.","Nice keyboard as well.","keyboard and buttons are bad almost no use..","I originally tested it in a store and said \"I think I can get used to that\" but for a long time used a wireless full size keyboard instead.","The screen is clear with some reflection, and can also be tweaked for brightness on the keyboard.","It is a very stable and rock solid machine.Granted, there are internal problems with the keyboard as stated previously, however these are mere annoyances, and the pros of this system greatly outweigh the cons.This machine has never given me a problem hardware wise, and in fact, this is the first machine in which I did not have to reinstall windows every month.It serves as a \"decent\" gaming system, of course it is not the best, but it is fairly good for being mobile, and under a grand.","Apple cust service (number in the manual) offered to send me a new keyboard for free, but after talking to him more I decided to just return to Amazon for a new one.","Display is really good and keyboard is also very smooth.4.","Besides, if I wanted something permanently installed on a desk, I would have bought a desktop computer (far less money, easier and cheaper to upgrade, easier to use keyboard etc)To sum up, I would describe this product as having none of the benefits of a typical laptop and none of the benefits of a desktop.","within the first month the entire bottom half of the keyboard stopped working.","Keyboard - eh, its a laptop keyboard.","From motherboard replacement to cooling issues to keyboard problems.","I\u0027ve used one for several years for trips and weekends- I can keep up on email, play music, even watch a movie on it (DVD player built in)..The 1.33ghz has built-in WIFI and bluetooth, so my external keyboard works perfectly with it, and I use it in any coffee shops or WIFI zones while travelling.The weakest point (in my perspective) is that it\u0027s not a powerhouse processor.","The keyboard is as good as you are going to get in a ultraportable.","Why SQL Server? Well anyone who works in a professional environment knows the limitations of MS Access and will appreciate the SQL Server capability.If you want a cute computer because it\u0027s small, then this is not for you! If you want a computer that is fully functional and able to connect to the Internet anywhere service is available, and if you are willing to work with the 4.5 inch screen as well as the two fingered keyboard, then seriously look into this model as it meets ebery expectation I had in fitting such a large package into such a tiny median.If it was any larger I would not carry it with me every where.","The screen is sharp and impressive, the battery life is good (not quite the 6 hours advertised, but a solid 4-4.5 hours), its incredibly portable, the full-size keyboard is easy to use, and I\u0027ve easily integrated the iBook at home for the full desktop experience with a regular monitor, wireless mouse, and external drive (to make up for the small hard drive).Having to buy Microsoft Office was definitely a negative of the iBook, but it was definitely worth the extra cost.","Alternately, you can choose to drive your external display exclusively at high resolutions like 1600x1200 or 1920x1440.Note: on this machine there are 3 USB ports, but no PS/2 ports for an external keyboard or mouse.","I like the motion sensor protection for the hard drive, and the (semi?) spill-proof keyboard.","My only real complaint or observation is that the area just above the keyboard can get very hot with extended use.","They authorized the same technician to replace the keyboard on one visit and he replaced the LCD panel on a 3rd visit.Replacing the LCD panel resolved the specific issues I was experiencing with the LCD, however the new LCD panel had a number of new issues.","sony so far has not solved or improved this keyboard problem.","The only flaw in this machine is the shallow keyboard, which is not a full size keyboard so they\u0027ve also moved certain keys around, so you have to get used to typing on it.","IF there was in fact spillage at one time, wouldn\u0027t it have occurred sooner? Regardless, they have to replace the motherboard, keyboard, and a couple of other things.","The screen is huge and the keyboard is great.","It\u0027s so sad that Toshiba has tried to obviously cut costs in their casing and Keyboard costs, which makes an otherwise superior product feel and look sub par and clunky.The battery life is short, but that is given to you in the specs.","It is a nice looking machine with a great display and keyboard.","My old Toshiba was virtually silent, and the fan seldom came on.*The keyboard is far too stiff and unresponsive.","I tried Toshiba and HP machines in the same price range that had better specs, but the build quality (especially the keyboards) and looks weren\u0027t in the same league as the Sony Vaio.","It\u0027s substantial and comfortable to use with a 17\" monitor and extended keyboard.","Well, NO LONGER.The laptop is extremely quick (@ 2.8 HT p4) and the full-size keyboard is nice for long typing sessions.","The keyboard does not feel as good as T40\u0027s, but not too far away and too bad.","Mine is quite and I like the feel of the keyboard.","Also, one of the keyboard letters got stuck at a weird angle and I popped it off trying to fix it.","In addition, the keyboard of the laptop is not reacing very well and the noise of the laptop is tremedous.","There is plenty of space for your hands to rest on the keyboard, and I noticed my hands do not tire as easily.","HP has full keyboard.","I\u0027d recommend any person considering this try the keyboard (or an equivalent Compaq or HP, it\u0027s common to several) before buying it.When I looked at the accessories, the unit appeared to use a generic docking station rather than a custom-designed one as Thinkpads do.","Having heard the speakers on the Toshiba Satellite 5205-S704, which are fantastic, rectangular speakers that actually raise up above the keyboard area, I had high expectations.","It\u0027s ugly, poor keyboard, but it works perfectly.This Sony runs very well on wired connection, but can\u0027t a company of this size get serious about what customers think of their products and test them before shipping? I bought the 730us through Circuit City for 899.99.","The fact that the fan seldom kicks in makes the ibook a truly quiet machine and with an external keyboard and a stand it makes a great desktop replacement.","The added numeric keypad is a very nice use of all that extra real estate surrounding the keyboard, but may take some getting used to.","The keyboard and touchpad are laid out in a perfect size, quality, and sensitivity.","So I let it drop down below 90% in the morning before I plug it in.Overall if you need a muscular, powerful computer for design and editing I highly suggest purchasing one!

Sure, it\u0027d be nice if the battery lasted forever, but this isn\u0027t an iBook; you\u0027re getting twice the computing power for less money, so some sacrifices become necessary.","Great keyboard (this is what drove me away from Dell - the new Dell notebooks have serious issue with their keyboards; I touch type at the rate of around 70 words/pm and I get lot of repeated keys in Dell; HP keyboard is great! I like this)3.","This is the reason I gave it two stars instead of just one, just because the thing still works.- Glossy screen, which was somewhat uncommon back in 2004.- Good picture on screen.- Three (3) USB ports.- One of the nicest and attractive keyboards to date, in my opinion.Cons- Massive.","Gateway promply sent a new one however, and it seems to be working better.I still feel that the M505x has the best screen (except for Sony\u0027s xbrite), the best keyboard, and the best sound compared to all the competitors.","It has some nice Apple touches, such as the mag-safe power plug (which works very well), display latches that hide away when the screen is open, and a keyboard that glows when the ambient light is low.","It still fits into my backpack-style laptop bag easily, and the size and weight aren\u0027t a problem in the least for my needs.The processor on this thing is a screamer! I\u0027ve never had a computer boot up and shut down as fast as this one in my life! And for once I finally have a computer that can actually let me see the benefits of having Broadband Internet-my other 3 computers didn\u0027t let me see much improvement in speed.The keyboard is nicely laid out, with nice, clicky buttons.The touchpad is nice, because it\u0027s not as freakishly sensitive as my other one was; the HP, if you even brushed against it in the slightest, it would register as a mouse left-click.","What I like the most are the keyboard, the sleek feel of the computer, and its weight.","That said, Windows runs great on this machine, probably better than most PC laptops but you need to get used to the keyboard layout- if you\u0027re an advanced user and want to partition your HD into more than just a Mac \u0026 Boot Camp partition (i.e. 2 partitions), do some research first, I wasted days trying to figure this out- if you\u0027re installing Windows XP, you might want to use the original CD to make a disc image, burn it to a blank disc, then install from the copy.","There are also two \\| keys which leads me to beleive that they could have gotten rid of one in order to make they keyboard have proper dimensions.","That was a mistake, for the reasons that follow.Pros:- Was available off the shelf with reasonable specs- Uses mostly decent hardware- Integrated webcam- Quick setup out-of-the-box- Reasonably impressive specs (but comes with Vista, which undoes much of that value)Cons:- Keyboard is flaky (one of my keys died after a year, others have problems and are dying, and nearly half of them have popped off randomly at least once)- Mouse pad is flaky (often stops responding for a couple minutes)- WiFi card crashes a lot (will refuse to turn on; will turn on but not find any networks when I am right next to a router; will find networks with good signals and not connect; will connect but not send anything)- Hard drive is non-standard (can\u0027t replace it with non-Sony drives)- Hard drive is often very slow- Battery life is terrible (less than 1.5 hours at full power, less than 2 on power saver mode) - whoever said it got 4 hours was either lucky, wrong, or using an upgraded battery- CD/DVD drive is *loud*- Integrated speakers are terrible- Integrated microphone is terrible, even by laptop standards- Laptop gets *EXTREMELY* hot, even in standby.","I especially like the speed, keyboard (like desktop) and wireless connection.","My only con point is that the keyboard has a lighter feel than my Dell that I am slowly getting used to.","When was the last time you heard of a battery lasting for over 3 years?! Mind you, I use this laptop every day.But aside from that, here are some pros:-Unbelievably sturdy and well built-Great display-Great sound quality-Keyboard (I don\u0027t have sticky issues with the keys like some people say they do)-Good quality cameraAnd some cons:-Runs hot.","I did pick-up the \"Ultrabase\" which functions like a docking station to plug in your full size monitor, keyboard and other perhipherals.","The keyboard is the weakest part of the otherwise wonderful machine.","you can spill milk on the keyboard, it can drain automatically.perfect laptop, great thinkpad.","The hinge between the screen and the keyboard is just untouchable.","It is a super toy, and yet with a bluetooth keyboard it is a fully functioning computer in every way.I have written several thousand words of a book on mine, without straining my eyes (set the display to \"margin width\").","The keyboard is large and easy to type on.","I develop real apps on this)Quicker suspend and restart Never ever have to shutdown.3USB ports , one for your digital camera, one for keyboard and one for mouse1 iLink port for your camcorder15\u0026quot; display : great for a notebookJog Dial : Just a gimmick :-\u0026gt;Looks good, runs fast, but you need a cart to carry it around.love it... be the first one to buy it...","Unfortunately there is no option for the backlit keyboard like there is on the larger models.","The keyboard is a giant step up from older ibook keyboards, and I prefer it to the powerbook keyboard.","The beautiful screen and excellent size and feel keyboard however leave all other ultra portables (including Sony Vaio range) in the shade.Overall I am thus very satisfied and would strongly recommend this model long as you are happy with the above compromises - I just wish Apple in their publicity and claims would accept that in terms of comparability it cannot match the rest of their laptop range but as an ultra portable it is King versus the competition (hence my \"mistress\" title to this review!) I have been eyeing the SZ series laptop for many months now as my old HP 3000zt is ready for the downgrade to the kids room.","In any case, the functional wear of the button can\u0027t be helped, except by resorting to an external mouse more often.* The keyboard is not lit...","Keyboard layout is ok.","I had used a lot of Thinkpads (from the IBM days) and knew those were the best laptops ever made -- built like tanks, great keyboards, gorgeous screens.Since I was on a budget, I couldn\u0027t afford a Thinkpad this time around.","The DVD controls are located on the left side of the keyboard and handy to use.","It\u0027s very versatile for a superportable computer, so DVDs and gaming are certainly not out of the question.PROS- Very stylish and sleek looking- Superb display- Tiny- Has dedicated video RAM- Intelligently laid out (this is a huge point with me - all the ports are in useful places)- AC adapter is small and has a cool glowing light which will impress the kind of people who like glowing lights- Has a mute button (the speakers are OK, about what you\u0027d expect from a laptop)- Flawless wireless G integration- Battery life seems pretty goodCONS- Keyboard is bouncy and not too big (and requires Function keys for end, page down etc)- Included software is pretty much useless (but about standard for PC laptops), and comes with various advertisements (Actually, there are a few amusing programs for digital photography and media sharing among many VAIOs, but these are not exactly a hot selling point)- Some ports covered with plastic lids - this actually makes the system look very sleek when they\u0027re closed, but I\u0027m afraid that they might break off at some point, and they\u0027re kind of in the way when you\u0027re hooking things up (this could be either pro or con, really).- According to The Internet, Sony\u0027s customer service is not great, but I haven\u0027t had any problems yet and thus haven\u0027t had to contact them.","Also the keyboard? I like the largeness of the keys and how it spans the whole bottom panel.","You put this together with the huge 17.1\" screen and the full sided keyboard and you wind up with a \"must have\".","Each revision of the mini keeps getting better for me: The keyboard fits my hands well, and the screen, while small, is brilliant and sharp (and at 768x1280, it is ALMOST equivalent to my Powerbook 17\u0026quot;!)It\u0027s fast, the battery life is very good (you really can get 5+ hours - I don\u0027t have to plug it in at work, putting it to sleep at lunch and meetings.","Is it a compromise? Well I guess for those who don\u0027t mind carrying around a 6 lb portable with all the bells and whistles or an ultraportable with slow processor, small keyboard but with more ports, I guess the MBA is.Where there is no compromise is in the speed, full sized keyboard, screen clarity and battery life.","If you are a mobile warrior, who means business (without compromises), buy this machine yesterday.It has almost full size keyboard with excellent feeling, all the functionality that you need.","To think it comes in at a very affordable price point, comes with a 2.0 GHz, built in iSight, Bluetooth, high quality microphone, The Absolute Best Keyboard I HAVE EVER USED, and yes the caps were necessary.","The AirCard software would die while it works on a PDA and over 6 laptops and tablets.Pros:+ Turns on fast+ CPU is definately faster than Jornada like 4 times as fast+ CF/PCMCIA slot are position nicely and takes both I/II+ Keyboard excellentCOns:+ Too big just isn\u0027t small enough to be like a Jornada and too small to be like a P1120 or Sony TR1 or JVC Interlink all of which are much more powerful+ Screen is worst I have ever seen+ Syncing/OS is out of date and difficultBottom line for the price it isn\u0027t too bad if you want something light to type on or run excel spreadsheets that will last 8 hours.","Build quality is poor - the plastic around the keyboard has signs of wear (just from moving my hands), the lid scratches very easily.Toshiba - what has happened to you?? You used to deliver premium products and your computers were known to be the most durable, how can you have the conscience to sell something this crappy!? I felt secure buying it second hand because \"this was a Toshiba\", now I will never buy a Toshiba ever again.","The light off the LCD provided me with enough light (Barely) to see the keyboard in low-light conditions.While it may seem like I have a lot of complaints about this computer, I actually prefer it in many ways over its much more expensive sibling, the PowerBooks.","Once that is done, initial start up times increase by about 75%.PROS: Amazing screen, fast graphics, superb keyboard, lots of ports, built-in webcam, fingerprint reader, etc.CONS: One major one (at least for me) is that the audio out ports are both located on the front of the unit.","If you\u0027re used to laptops, the even smaller keyboard is just fine.","One guy was typing on his laptop, another guy had this collapsable keyboard hooked up to a PalmPilot? It wasnt\u0027 working to well on his lap.","I just can\u0027t emphasize it enough.- It\u0027s design, let\u0027s face it... it looks great!- It\u0027s usability, despite it\u0027s small sized keyboard ,it\u0027s designed to be used by your thumbs just like the rest of the computer.- Finally...","DO NOT put this software into your mac it is like a virus and can scramble the keyboard and slow down the machine immensely.I sent my MacBook Pro back to apple twice and they gutted, but could not figure out the problem until recently.","The display is nice, the keyboard is nice and the trackpad works as expected.I have not found a place where I could get more RAM and finding replacement parts for this puppy is a mayor pain.Would I recommend it? No, there are way better 64-bit alternatives out there.","I\u0027ve been an Apple fan for a long time, and I hope that at least the first two of the following problems will soon be resolved, but for the time being:(1) The keyboard quite often freezes and there does not seem to be a consistent solution.","It allows for productive usage almost right on and leaves very little to be desire, but for a little better case, since the connections between the sides and the top case / keyboard are rather unconfortable unless you have your hands clearly over the top, and not on it as many do.","When these keys are hit, the keyboard flexes slightly and the sound made is significantly different than the keys on the left side which have structure below them.","It does everything with grace.BTW, I reccomend the Appld bluetooth mouse and keyboard.","What else can I say abou tthis laptop besides its just great! No crashing, voice command that can even tell you knock knock jokes, an impressive processor, beautiful design, illuminating keyboard, great bluetooth capability, and even the touchpad works beautifully.","Empty promises after empty promises and they will even hang up on you- the audacity! I\u0027m paying over $1,000 for a laptop; I\u0027m paying these guys good money to hang up on me? It just didn\u0027t make sense.Yes, I like the ThinkPad X61, but I was sure as hell wasn\u0027t going to pay over a grand and getting hanged up by a rep. bery good Besides the fact that the iBook did not come with the Classic Environment installed as advertised, it has run flawlessly for three months.I love the keyboard, it works perfectly with a two button mouse and scrollbutton, and it does a bootable backup to a Firewire external drive using Silverkeeper.Tiger is a very nimble operating system and runs in 1/3 the ram as my iMac and actually surfs the web faster than my iMac.It\u0027s a great little compact computer.","In that sense, ThinkPad is well worth the price.THE BOTTOM LINE:ThinkPad - BMW of laptop computer.ThinkPad T60 - the Ultimate Business Machine I bought the Toshiba Satellite A15-S1292 for about $550 after all (annoying)mail in rebates and for the cost I paid, its an amazing machine.I have also installed Redhad Linux operating system (I can work in either Redhat Linux or Windows XP)and a wireless PCMCIA card \u0026 there have been no problems.I dont have extreme processing requirements \u0026 for all the work that I do,this machine is pretty fast.Things I like-1.There is ample palm-rest space - so there is no strain at all when typing.2.The display is an inch above the keypad and it gives you a feeling that you are looking into an ultra thin monitor.Things I dont like-1.Junk Software that comes along - Quicken,AOL,Drag\u0027n\u0027Drop - the cd writing software(was Horrible).2.The keyboard is bouncy \u0026 really annoying.A note to those who want to play with BIOS settings.","The display quality is amazing, and hardware features like keyboard backlighting make the MBP stand out in the crowd.","It has little to no acceleration, use the stylus and keep the mouse in joystick mode, it\u0027ll make scrolling much easier.The \"dialpad\" popup keyboard is horrendous, ignore it and never touch it again.The keyboard on the device itself is for emergencies only.","Relatively thin and light for a heavy-duty computer.Great keyboard with dual-pointing devices: trackpad and trackpoint mini-stick, and the buttons for both devices have excellent tactile feedback.Screen is clear and bright, though somewhat cool (slightly bluish)Minuses: USB plugs are on the back - not very convenient for plugging in a USB key.Battery life is only about 1-1/2 hours.Would I buy again? Yes, definitely.","problems with the wireless card - often it doesn\u0027t work - i.e. the computer can\u0027t recognize that it is present!Hard to figure out if all of the problems are because of Vista or Sony...Service Pack for vista completely messes everything upthe keyboard is very loud!the jack for headphones doesn\u0027t always work properlythe Vaio service module shuts down often - i.e. 2-3x per week - which makes it impossible to dim the background light intensityCustomer service always has a simple solution - erase the hard drive and start over! Pro:Buena presentacion, delgada, bastante rapida, la pantalla tiene un brillo y color excepcional.Contra:La bateria no dura mas que el promedio (1 hora y media por lo general).En general, para todo lo que la he necesitado la encuentro adecuada y con casi todas las opciones pre-configuradas y listas para usar.Vale la pena pagar el sobre-costo de llevar la marca SONY.","Not sure how this reflective technology is supposed to help things, it seems like overkill.I also like the keyboard, it\u0027s easy to type on and well laid out.I have noticed if you pick up the notebook from a corner the weight of the notebook can cause the plastic on the palmrest area to creek a bit - that\u0027s not really good but you really shouldn\u0027t pick up your $1000 notebook like that anyways.","I have had to replace the keyboard, it\u0027s pretty easy to knock the keys off if you aren\u0027t being careful.","I love it! I purchased apple\u0027s \"mini DVI\" to DVI adapter, the apple bluetooth mouse and keyboard and use this laptop (with the clam shell closed) with my Viewsonic VA1912wb 19 inch monitor when I want more screen real estate (I didn\u0027t even have to install drivers for the bluetooth mouse, bluetooth keyboard, or monitor...the computer recognized those devices and they just worked.)","I have to admit though, that after initially being impressed by the light-sensing, auto-dimming screen - I am annoyed by the fact that the sensor is apparently in the keyboard and, in a bright room, certain hand movements cause the screen brightness to change back and forth.","If using the keyboard skins please be aware that due to increased keyboard height from this add-on, this *will* affect your screen.","I bumped up the memory to 2GB just to give Windows room; it may be possible to run with just 1GB, but I did not mind spending the extra $140 for the memory.Plus points: powerful processor, big big screen, nice enough keyboard, quiet fans, nice speakers, bluetooth integration, price is competitive with other PCs.Negative points: DVD drive died and replaced under warranty in the first week, big screen means more weight, and hot machine (don\u0027t put it on your lap unless you are sitting inside an igloo).Intangible point: a Microsoft consultant said to me: \"Your laptop is really cool; who makes that?\" Ha.","Keyboard is nice and springy.","If I\u0027m writing a paper or something I typically use a USB keyboard, but don\u0027t let that discourage you from buying this laptop..","It has a somewhat cheaper \"feel\" to it overall as compared to Sony Vaios or Dells, but of course, it IS cheaper! (It is nowhere near as cheap-feeling as the bargain Acer/Lenova/etc types.)I have experienced no problems getting used to the keyboard (though it does have a lot of flex).","The location of the speakers (above keyboard) is not such a good idea when it seems as thought the speakers are aimed toward outerspace.","I have lost count of the number of times I have fallen asleep on the keyboard (with the 526 on).","The keyboard is roomy and comfortable (hard to believe given the small size) and the iLife bundled software enabled me to take my hundreds of digital photos and MPEG clips and create a movie after just a few hours of work.And for those who complain about the heat produced by the PowerBook, not true.","I liked the old powerbookG4 keyboard style better.","This looks weird compared to the keyboard and rest of the case.","I also like the feel of the keyboard that has been criticized on past iBook models.","This part is confusing; just know that games and applications work fast.- Screen checks in at 14.1\" which is a good working size - slightly more to carry than those 12\" screens, but much more useable and it leaves room in the chassis for a full-sized keyboard.- Comes with internal DVD/CDRW which I find really cool (as opposed to external, which would be a pain to carry).- AC adaptor is pretty cool.","The keyboard is nicely centered and feels sturdy.","Keyboard and trackpad are nice.","You can detach the keyboard completely if you don\u0027t want to use it.","This type of keyboard makes afraid of having my hands tired after writing long documents or just a few letters.","On the one occasion I spoke with Toshiba to look for updates they were EXCELLENT!As a desktop I have connected a 17 inch Samsung LCD monitor and wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse along with a USB hub making it a simple matter of connecting or removing 2 plugs.All in all a great machine, my only complaint was( No Track Ball ); a left over issue from using and IBM but solved by carrying a optical mouse in my bag.","The keyboard in particular takes 120 seconds to replace as it\u0027s just 5 screws and it pops out.","Its a pretty good product but a few things could have been better like the keyboard...it definitely could have been faster to type, you just dont see the words on the screen as fast you type... its just not quite as good a speed as its on other windows xp laptops...you just can\u0027t type that fast.","If you touch type, the area in front of the keyboard is a handy wristrest.","It has a NONSTANDARD KEYBOARD LAYOUT, and you probably won\u0027t realize this fact until you actually see it and use it because, to my knowledge, all their product descriptions fail to mention it.","It has a great screen, and great keyboard (in fact one of the best laptop keyboards I have used).","The screen is nice and clear and the keyboard is quiet.","You can manage the mouse, the typing and everything with your thumbs and believe me, it works, most people complaints about it\u0027s tiny keyboard because it\u0027s small for their fingers and bla bla bla... but it is not designed to be used like your everyday keyboard, it\u0027s designed to be used on the road, while walking, etc.","The keyboard can flip up.","The use of the keyboard is not cramped like some of the other email appliances.","ENOUGH KEYBOARD SPACE..","I\u0027ve had my 280P for a month, and have waited this long to write a review because this little gem has all the bells and whistles of a full-size computer, but it also takes a period of adjustment for anyone who works with a normal computer, keyboard, and mouse 8 hours a day.","As something of a correction to that, I have a wrist rest under the back three inches of the keyboard at all times.","The keyboard is great, screen is good and overall quality is very good.","Everything is sleek and shiny (except the matte finish on the keyboard and palm rests), and the glossy screen makes everything look sharp and color-drenched.","Altough it is not designed for that kind of work, the processor works pretty good and has enough RAM for almost any application.I am happy with my purchase, no problems at all: silent, powerful \u0026amp; fast (not the best PC of course), not heavy, well made, clean screen, nice touchpad and keyboard, great connectivity (WiFi, VGA, Ethernet, USB, FireWire, you name it!) and super value.","Beautifully designed, light weight, nice color, very good keyboard, amazing Screen Quality and Sound, Fast, good battery life, good price for centerino, and made by Toshiba.If you want to get a new laptop or to replace the existing one, just take a look at this and then read some reviews, you have to see it for yourself and play with it for a few minutes and compare it to others, then you will see what I meant and why I very much recommend it.","The keyboard feel is better on both than on the Toshiba, but...oh my gosh--that superbly bright screen! Overall quality \u0027feel\u0027? Toshiba is 3rd of the three.","I returned to the store the following day to purchase a wireless mouse,Keyboard placement is awkward if you\u0027re used to using a PC key.","The operating system is beautiful and runs smoothly even when multitasking.When I\u0027m at home, I connect the PB to a Dell 21\" LCD monitor running at 1600x1200 resolution, and a wireless keyboard and mouse.","It was easy to pop the keyboard off and plug the thing in.","Keyboard is fine and the touchpad works just like it should.","He\u0027s got space for more inside his casing, which is more than you can say for newer machines, that are just meant to be thrown out after a year.Another bonus is the full-size keyboard, the two types of mouse (a touchpad and the pointing stick, the latter of which has a middle button which I\u0027m sure does SOMETHING but I don\u0027t know what), the very sturdy mouse-buttons (they\u0027re loud but push down satisfyingly), the status lights at the bottom of the monitor, and the little white LED on the top of the monitor, that illuminates the keyboard in the dark.","Just connect your monitor, wired or wireless keyboard/mouse and everything you should connect to USB/Firewire ports and you\u0027re done!- The keyboard as well as the computer itself it\u0027s veeeeery well designed to be used with your thumbs.","its really fast and very good for gaming.i had some problems with the tv tuner in media center, but it works great in HP quickplay.Vista some times fail when i unplug the USB remote control reciever.its all i have to say, for the rest i recommend it a 100%, i thing its a really good choice considering the price Every notebook must be compared with \"overpriced\" VAIO, why? The answer is simple: VAIO is indeed the best (Apple\u0027s products not included, since it is a different world).I was checking this Notebook that a friend bought few days ago; nothing really impressive: the battery life is less than average, the touch and feel of the keyboard is \"Korean cars quality\", solidness does not appear anywhere, the case is plastic, soft and lack serious resistance; the hard is noisy (with less than 10 days of interruptive work??); and my HP omnibook xe4400 (3 years old) has the same brightness and sound quality.","No Firewire port, no keyboard/mouse PS/2 ports.","The software has absolutely no configuration, blocks standard multimedia keyboard calls (to configure external programs -- who uses Windows Media Player anyway?!), and guess what? The cheap LCD screen falls apart.","Its full size keyboard, but the touch is not at all light.I have 1 gig of RAM, and run demanding applications like PhotoShop with no problem.","Tactile response of the keyboard is simply outstanding, and the trackpad is the first of five laptops I have owned that is actually a pleasure to use, particularly with the \"two-finger\" scroll and right-click capability.I debated over this and a MacBook Pro, and I can say without hesitation that this was a perfect choice for me.","However, when the computer was just over 14 months old (not quite three months out of warranty), the keyboard failed completely, and I had to purchase an external USB keyboard to be able to continue using it.","Some recurring issues in forums are: overheating issues, dead pixel (one) on the LCD (which some tech guy at a store told me is common on LCD screens, anyhow), smaller keyboard size (true enough, but it\u0027s not bad at all), sound system not being outstanding (come on, people, get a desktop for such extensive audio work!), and the Windows XP Home Edition that\u0027s pre-loaded (yes, really, DO upgrade to the Pro Edition, as it\u0027s less \"buggy\").BUT, what notebook is perfect? What other notebook has this much power, speed, battery power-saving capabilities (Centrino, baby), DVD-RW/CD-RW, Widescreen LCD screen display (you have to SEE to believe..it\u0027s SO beautifully bright that you can\u0027t help but be mesmerized and think \"purty\"!), 80GB storage capacity, firewire port, 4 USB ports, built-in wireless WiFi connectivity (get the Linksys Wireless router WRT54G for faster, more reliable speed), SD memory storage, and at 6 lbs., what else could you want? Think about it: what notebook doesn\u0027t have problems? They all do or will at some point.","After only one month, and having carried it around in a Tumi computer bag that provided good protection, the case on the left side of the keyboard pulled away from the rest of the case.","Improvements I would like to see: the sharp edge of the keyboard palm rest can dig into your skin after a while, most other laptops have a rounded edge where your palm would rest, also the white color on the palm rest area stains easily and does not clean with the mild soap i have tried, I have read this is a common problem on some of these, where the palm rest eventually turns a brownish color.","A keyboard cover is also a plus for better resale value.","I\u0027ve replaced hinges(very hard), screens(very hard), keyboard(easy), touchpad(easy), fans(medium - you need CPU paste).","Pop out the keyboard, set-up the mouse and essential turn the rest of the laptop into a monitor.","The screen could be a bit brighter, but is quite nice nonetheless, the keyboard is comfortable, and the battery life is decent at ~3 hours, and it\u0027s great to have a dual layer-comptable DVD writer.","I could not be more displeased with this laptop.The form factor of the keyboard is terrible.","Most importantly is the keyboard.","The screen sort of hovers slightly over the keyboard when latched (\u0026 2 small rubber feet keep it from touching) \u0026 it opens up to fall behind the main section (so that it doesn\u0027t catch.","But for our purposes the better keyboard and brighter screen really matter, so I spent the extra money on the Pro.","Intermittingly the keyboard interface becomes hashed on some bootups - letters are numbers etc. unless I reboot \u0026amp; the mouse button became worn after a few months of left-clicking that I now use a USB Mouse \u0026amp; Keyboard.","Their response was to offer me a derisory 10% discount on the cost of repairs.Then, about a month later, the screen flickered briefly and died completely! I was left with an expensive laptop that was effectively reduced to a desktop machine that could only be used with an external keyboard and an external monitor.So, here was a laptop that had been used carefully for about five hours a day, in a benign environment, had never suffered any kind of physical damage, and had only been taken out of the house on a handful of occasions, and yet had developed two major faults in the space of just sixteen months! Sony\u0027s response to my complaints was simply to argue that their machines \"are some of the most reliable available on the market\".Not one, but two major faults in just over a year.","The \"A/V panel\" off to the side of the keyboard is... well, it\u0027s had problems since the start.","Yes, it is a smaller keyboard.","I am already getting used to the shift key and believe I will eventually \"break\" in the keyboard.","On top of the F-Keys, just right below the screen will be just as hot as the bottom of the keyboard.","You will need a USB keyboard or mouse if you want to use an external one or get a USB-PS/2 adapter.","If it were destined to be used mostly at home, I\u0027d have saved a few hundred dollars and just bought a plug-in keyboard.","(Gotta love Apple\u0027s design team for those little things!) The keyboard, unlike other models, isn\u0027t \"spongy.\"In fact, it is rather sturdy for a laptop keyboard.","I would spend a few more bucks to buy the mouse as well.c) While the keyboard is a little dull, the touch screen is too sensitive.","The keyboard.","The keyboard does not work type signs rare and do not serve the numbers.Since the keyboard could not write, to with lowercase uppercase type.I went the technician to repair, but I have not managed to solve the problem.Very bad purchase ... bad ... poor.","After pleading ignorance to what could be ailing this now glorified CPU and keyboard, the support people at Sony are now advising me to send it in to their less than stellar group at the service center in San Diego.","The keyboard feeling is great, the setup out of box is superb.I would only say the when considering this machine with others with Pentium 4-M, the main tradeoff is between 1.5-2 pounds less versus computing power for processor-intensive uses like MatLab or Engineering software or advance digital work.","Light sensors automatically adjust your screen brightness and keyboard lighting, although these can be adjusted manually.","The keyboard is comfortable.","You take a bit of time (about 3 days) to get used to it, especially a ONE button mouse and the shortcuts with the keyboard, but it is very nice, very stable.","It\u0027s a recommendable product, looks good, the LCD have an excellent quality and look amazing, the keyboard feels strong, the wlan and lan work fine, so if want some notebook, this one is a good alternative.","Using a FireWire cable to transfer over from my old PowerBook was pure simplicity, and even the search terms I use in Safari copied over (I was stunned).The only complaints I have (and they are minor) is (1) the keyboard has taken some getting used to, and (2) Front Row performs surprisingly sluggishly.","The small keyboard has taken some time to get used to but I cannot think of anything bad about this computer.Additionally, once you own a Mac you are privy to the benefits of a kind of subculture .","I bought an external keyboard but it is not convenient every time.","Now moving on from the bad, the good things included a roomy keyboard with a very nicely located shift key (its great for fast typing).","In order for me to hear songs, the volume has to be cranked up to the maximum and it\u0027s still not loud enough.Now, some of the letters on the keyboard is not working for me!!!It is rather bulky and heavy.","Keyboard is tiny.","Keyboard is well designed and keys are well placed.","I also purchased a bluetooth foldable keyboard.","- Great size, form factor, weight, and performance- I use the laptop for pre-sales demos, development work, and services work- The screen and keyboard are a bit small so a monitor and keyboard are necessary when at your desk Great size for travel, lightweight and fast.I upgraded from a previous portable Sony Vaio and it is worth the change.","One inexpensive replacement keyboard later, I was back to illegally downloading music off LimeWire.Of course that \"adequate\" 40 Gig hard drive is full, but my 300 Gig G-Drive Q is the perfect dumping ground for the memories we\u0027ve shared.Ah well.","The keyboard was another unexpected treat with quiet but firm action.The Intel Pentium 4-M processor can use SpeedStep and other power saving techniques.","Anyone who\u0027s ever tried typing on an iBook, and then on the Averatec 3200 will tell you that the Averatec is a much more user-friendly machine, because your hands never accidentally graze the touchpad, so the cursor stays where you left it.The analog volume control is especially nice, since I detest changing volume with the keyboard.","Realmente es una m\u0026aacute;quina poderosa y muy \u0026uacute;til.Yo compr\u0026eacute; la m\u0026iacute;a en Amazon despu\u0026eacute;s de comparar precios con Best Buy y Circuit City : en Amazon estaba $400 m\u0026aacute;s barato! Similar to another notebook shopper, I debated between the comparable Gateway M505X and Toshiba M35-S359, (see the very complete review \"Nice machine, nice price\", December 2, 2003 for the Toshiba).Unlike that reviewer, I ended up purchasing the Gateway for a couple of reasons:The Toshiba felt a bit flimsy and the keyboard was mushy.","It doesn\u0027t explain Bluetooth hookups with keyboards or whatever, or synchronizing, or much of anything else for that matter.","I\u0027ve also set up a dual-booted environment with Linux and Windows, so I will speak on that as well.Firstly, the functionality -- I have a loose key on the keyboard and a single pixel out on the display.","At one point the keyboard started typing all the WRONG letters.Third, as I\u0027m sure everyone knows, the battery life really sucks, mine lasts for a little over an hour, so wherever I go, I have to take the charger thing with me, which restricts where I\u0027m allowed to sit with my computer, since I always need to find an available outlet, thus making it no different than a desktop, really.Fourth, the metal case scratches extremely easily.","First and foremost, the keyboard is falling apart.","This thing is a baby in comparison! The layout of the keyboard and the feel of the keys is wonderful.","The keyboard is a great layout, not at all cramped, and now I find regular keyboards to be odd.","I did, ironically with no improvement.I contacted customer service, who suggested that I recieved a bad keyboard.","My wife complains about the keyboard and has difficulty typing on it vs our Dell laptop.","I love the keyboard size and the fact that it has a numeric keyboard already built in.","Their keyboard doesn\u0027t have the writst resting support, so it is really uncomfortable to use the keyboard.","I replaced the hard drive and the next thing to go was the keyboard.","iv never been so happy with a product in my life! i can\u0027t fault it, apart from the lack of backlight with the keyboard but every other bit of this computer is beautiful.","If you ever thinking to have UMPC, keyboard is a MUST!6.","Some recommend leaving a cloth over the keyboard.","Its got altec lansing speakers that provide rich sound, a nice addition is the dedicated controls for DVD and CD right on the top of the keyboard, the screen is a nice big 15.4 inches, with nice contrast and even back lighting.","The keyboard has a few keys out of place from what\u0027s standard, but once you get used to the changes, they make sense (DEL and END within easy reach, ALT next to the arrow keys so you can go forwards and back within an internet browser quickly, etc).","However, some digging on my part showed an undocumented advanced graphic media setting some six menus down in desktop - properties that needed to be changed.)Also, regarding initial set up: I found I could not separate the Bluetooth, wireless lan and wwan settings and needed to talk with customer service again, but they were used to this call and quickly walked me through the network setup (incidentally, the wait time to talk to a techie was about 1 minute).As with most laptops, the keyboard is flat, not tiered.","The plastic surrounding the keyboard bows up around the power button.","My 6 month old machine was shipped with the wrong operating system (Averatec blamed Amazon), the keyboard was defective, and when I called for warranty service, I was treated like a felon by Averatec \"customer service\".","This makes this laptop a real pain to plug in to an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc on a regular basis and even when you do, you have a lot of unsightly cables shooting out from the sides.","It runs really fast, the Web cam is pretty spiffy, nice lighting, keyboard.","The keyboard layout is strange.","The keyboard and display are both very nice.","Now, a small keyboard isn\u0027t going to be any good on any computer if you want to write a term paper or create the company\u0027s 2008 budget but even tasks such as entering a web URL seem to take longer than they should due to the keyboard design.","I had heard bad things about the keyboard.","The design is fabulous, the keyboard the best among all the laptops I\u0027ve seen so far.","It also features full size keyboard with separate numerical keys - just like on your desktop.","Keyboard feels right despite its small form factor.","I like the layout of the keyboard of all the laptops I have used this is the best layout.","It happens even if there is no disk in the drive! Short of removing the DVD drive there is no way to turn off this annoying \"feature\" (bug).The keyboard isn\u0027t as nice as the keyboards found on previous Powerbooks.","Personally I would go with an Acer Aspire over the TravelMate because the Aspire has a flat keyboard while the TravelMate is curved.","The screen is new the mouse button still clicks like it was new, keyboard is great condition, and it got here just on time.","Now im not saying this is a bad laptop but you can do better.Lets start looking at whats bad about this lap topone its really uncomfortable on my lap with the big battery and the headphones digging up my chesttwo it overheats like crazythree the whole computer in my openion is oversized(but i knew that before i bought this laptop).but there are some good things about this laptop.one its vistatwo it remembers your logon username and password if you get the fingerprint scannerthree fairley fastand finally four looks nice, love the blue lights surrounding the keyboard and the design on the computer.So not that bad of a computer but shop around you can find a better laptop I had this notebook for 14 months and it had probelm from day one..the quick play button at one time stoped two times,the keybord needed replace,and the video card stoped working so now its off to the repair as of 04/23/08..this note book as been in repair 6 time..I tryed to get HP to replace with a new notebook but there not up to doing so.I dont recommend this notebook or any other product from HP.this is my first and last HP product I had this notebook for a few months, having switched from the PC to the Mac platform.","Previous computer I owned, much slower then this one, took at most 30 seconds to load fully.One last feature of this computer is it\u0027s keyboard.","i bought the Core Duo first but after a week the keyboard and track pad stopped functioning so i took it to the Apple guys to see if they could fix it and they couldn\u0027t.","Come on! This is an ultra portable, thin and light notebook, without compromising screen and keyboard sizes, plus amazing screen and multitouch technologies...","Within a year, the letters began rubbing off of my most used keys, and the keyboard became so loosey-goosey and rickety-sounding that it was no longer a pleasure to use the darn machine.Having dropped and totaled my latest, a Macbook, I\u0027m forced to return to this beaten-up baby, but it\u0027s going to need a new keyboard.","The keyboard is relatively big, but is still not quite full size.","1000 screws on the back to undo, undo hard drive, wireless card, memory, keyboard.","They keyboard is awesome so if you have large fingers and need an ultra portable this is ok if you can get around the screen.","Laptop magazine has given this a \u0027best buy\u0027, and i agree.Some things to note:The little keyboard may prove a problem for someone with big hands, as some of the keys are shrunk for space.The battery life isnt up to par, it lasts only about two hours, not the three as advertised, so i\u0027ll be asking for a second come christmas.it can get a bit warmer than i expected it to, but thats of small matter in the big picture, if you keep in mind to put a coaster or something simple under it to give the fan a bit more space to work with, its realy no incovenience.You wont regret this purchase and you\u0027ll save a good $100 in the end... good on averatec.","It may be possible to get key replacements but from what I can tell the cost is very high.The other problem is a battery that only last 1 1/2 to 2 hours, not good for much of anything.Just because of the keyboard, I doubt that my next computer will be a Sony in spite of everything else working fine.","The keyboard layout is rational if unconventional, and your right thumb can page up/ down rather easily, making the lack of a scroll wheel somewhat easier to take.Should you buy it? I\u0027d recommend it, although I might say that waiting for a sale is a smart idea.","The keyboard area gets pretty warm, it feels like you\u0027re sweating whenever you\u0027re typing.","At a little over 5 pounds, this is a reasonably weighted unit for the function, but a long day of toting this around will still wear out your shoulder.In addition to ThinkPad trademarks like the trackpoint for moving the cursor, several other niceties have been added over the years, including dedicated speaker volume control buttons (including a mute) just above the keyboard, and a small keyboard light housed at the top of the screen.","In 1999 I bought a VAIO desktop Digital Studio Desktop (455Mhz) , and it never let me down, actually we are still using it now at home.The laptop, when at home isconnected to a Sony DCR-TRV310 Digital 8 camera via ilink, a Sony DRX-510UL USB and Ilink DVD+-RW/+-R, and a western digital WD1200B007 external Hard disk.With 3 USB ports, a Ilink , 2 PCMCIA and Memory stick , compostive video out, audio out this laptop is great for multimedia.Three sore points :-There is no built in Microphone, just a mic input-Finding a connector to hook up the Component video directly to TV is something I am still pursuiing.- As a real road warrior, I carry this laptop in a roller due to its weight.Battery is acceptable, but not extraordinary.I could not find a docking station, which would have come handy.I use a laptop stand/Lap platform to prevent heating problems, as the main fan outlet is underneath.The Keyboard is a real natural.","The keyboard is not as good as IBM Thnkpad T40.","The full size keyboard is comfortable and the computer overall feels light considering the screen size.","The special configuration of the keyboard might present a problem to true touch typists, but for those of use who plod along, it is adequate.There is minimal software beyond XP Pro preinstalled.","I did order the USB Keyboard though, as I do miss one, but really like the split keyboard on the frame as well as using it as a tablet and the handwriting recognition is great.I really recommend this product.","All because you have to press the keyboard all the way down and it is not that sensitive compared to IBM, DELL or MAC laptops I have used.","The build quality is above-average for the pricepoint, the full-size keyboard is well laid out and has a tight, positive feel, the display is big, crisp and bright, the Super MultiDrive is an excellent feature allowing reading from/writing to just about any optical media.","The cool, click and lift keyboard provides access to check the wireless antenna but that does not help the range and speed problems.Base memory is adequate but run an MS Office app and it grinds the drive like a Bunn coffee grinder.","It always worked, it was fast, it was light, and it had a button to turn off the wireless from the keyboard (a feature which I loved - Windows makes it really hard to do).","I may wind up needing to use an external USB keyboard.","The keyboard controls remain exactly the same, with brightness, volume, and keyboard illumination.","With the silent keyboard, I can multi-task and flirt with a girl via phone and instant message at the same time!Anyhow, to complete my test of all functions I needed to burn a DVD.","The 200X has an ultramodern design -- sleek silver case, cool blue keyboard all in a slim lightweight package.","There is a 15 step procedure in the internet, which includes pealing the keyboard.","Add to that the Pentium 3.2 HT processor with 533 front side bus, large 80 Meg hard drive, very fast wireless B/G adaptor even though my router is an old Linksys 11 Meg B standard, and the dual layer 8X +/- DVD writer, the rest of the specs are large 15.4 brilliant screen, full size keyboard, 56K Modem, 1 Fire wire 1394, 3 USB 2, Ethernet adaptor, 1 A/V out, Microphone in, Audio out, and a lot of multimedia and authoring software.Set up is a breeze, the laptop is unpacked, hooked, and run in 5 minutes, you better have things to do right away.","Wireless is great and easy to use, just press a button.Want a cheap and lightweigt, I may recoomend (except keyboard, if it would bother you, don\u0027t buy it) It is a great product, just as I expected from apple.","If true, that\u0027s about twice the battery autonomy of my Pro- not having a \"real\" graphics card is no impediment to any \"normal\" use, only for gaming (and perhaps video editing)- screen and keyboard are much more comfortable than I thought.","However, Toshiba has some of the worst keyboard layouts.","The keyboard is great.","The keyboard did take a little getting used to - especially the small shift key on the right side, but I didn\u0027t buy the computer for the shift key.","Left side of keyboard quit functioningDo not buy Toshiba!!!! They\u0027re disposable.","Also, spontaneously, the keyboard will suddenly start typing in all caps for a minute or two.","Even as I am typing this review, the keyboard area is unpleasantly warm.The screen does not close tightly.","So I had to resort to a wireless keyboard and mouse, which is great, but it misses the point.","The only other problem I have is with the keyboard.","The right shift key has virtually disappeared relative to a standard keyboard, and the arrow keys are very awkwardly placed.","The coolest new feature I have to say would be the sensor controlled illuminated keyboard that just amazes the heck out of me.The machine is the fastest I have owned and with OS X Panther -- this laptop leaves the rest behind.The only drawback is the price which for some people might be a bit over the top, but considering the product you are getting it is well worth it.An absolute must buy.","Sixth reason, the keyboard layout felt mushy and the keypad layout is really whacky (the keys are hard to find).","Do not hesitate, as Lenovo is starting to phase out the glory of the ThinkPad series by using cheaper parts (chiclet keyboards? REALLY?) Excellent product - really slick - works well - is quite light - and has a great design.","I can feel that one of these keyboards will not last longer than 2 years.","It has a great secreen and keyboard.","The keyboard feels nice, but it simply quit working after about 4 months of lower-than-average use.","The Macbook also sports a brand new keyboard that makes typing on the it a dream.","It is still a capable keyboard though.","I primarily used this computer with a docking station and as a desktop with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse.","As mentioned in another review, keyboard keys have been intermittently sticky.Warranty HORRORS, my screen went out at about 45 days, it took 2 hours on the phone with HP Indian Tech-support that doesn\u0027t speak even marginal english to get an RMA to return the unit.","Most features you will find in the sub-$1000 category.Despite some reviews the keyboard is tactile and solid.","Windows users just have to get used to using control-click instead of right click and some differences in keyboard shortcuts.Expose.","Edges surrounding keyboard are sharp and dig into wrists.","The mouse is nice and they keyboard is great also.","Add an EV-DO air card (if it\u0027s available in your area) and you have a broadband true portable that will handle any task.Pros: Good hardware selection (120 GB hard drive a plus), excellent performance, one of the best keyboards I\u0027ve used on a laptop.","In addition, I experienced problems with the installed media center shutting down without warning and keyboard cursor jumping to other parts of the page when typing.","The only con that I can think of is, being white, the keyboard area does show dirt/smudges after some use.","The keyboard was even worse than the first one.","And also make sure you try the keyboard first to see if you feel comfortable with it.","The first thing is it does not come with a program that we could use along with the stylus instead of using keyboard like other devices such as tablet PC or Pocket PC, so it is very inconvenient when you take it to a conference room or something, you always have to put your attention on typing on the very small keyboard.","pretty bad speakers ...would have been a 5 star if not for the speakers Fantastic screen, weighs just over 6 pounds, good keyboard and fast! The usual crappy touch pad (sorry, but I prefer a mouse) but any wireless mouse makes this the perfect desktop replacement machine.","the \"m\" key looks like an inverted \"w\" because of the unsual font on the keyboard letters.","I would really like to see a fingerprint reader on this thing and more buttons on the top of the keyboard.","The display is super, the keyboard is wonderful, and I\u0027m personally fine with not having a user replaceable battery.","If you want something tiny and really futuristic-looking (and also therefore cramped with a small screen and small keyboard) so that people in airports will stop and talk to you about it, then you should spend a little more.","It is fast, light, has intuitive design, and I have had no issues with the keyboard (as had earlier model users).","The bad news is that the second keyboard, while much better is still not acceptable.","The keyboard is nice as well.","Also if the keyboard issues in other reviews are making you reconsider, then disregard those too because they also have been fixed.I have nothing bad to say about it, if you\u0027ve never used Apple\u0027s OS, it can be the best experience you\u0027ve ever had, or you could find yourself lost based on if you really want to learn or not.","But there are also ergonomic disappointments, especially compared to my old Thinkpad T41:- The first and obvious one is the celebrated issue with the heat - the machines do get unacceptably hot under the palms near the keyboard.","The keyboard is really bad.","The AMD 64 bit 1.6Ghz TL-50 dual-cpu processor isn\u0027t really utilized all that well with the unoptimized Windows Vista or Windows XP Pro 32 bit operating systems - but Windows XP Pro (32 bit) works well enough and does recongnize the second CPU/processor and utilizes it for some things.Battery life is good (2 hrs +) but could be better, as could the keyboard - which while good, feels somewhat flimsy.","Despite the extra space the wide screen requires, Toshiba decided to use a keyboard that places the Page Up/Down, Ins, and other similar keys in a column to the left of the other keys, instead of together at the top left.","This basically does what I want--with the optional keyboard and case, requires little space and weight in a suitcase when those are at a premium--major drawbacks are processor speed, battery life (maybe half an hour based on settings), and limited wireless distance.","Nearly everything about it is solid and well-designed, from the location of the ports to the mechanism that opens and closes the screen to the feel of the keyboard when you type.","My other gripes are the keyboard is downright painful to use and that forced me to buy another one.","Keyboards wear out quicker for writers, hinges go off the hinge at the constant idea spurts.","I enjoy all the little additions that apple has put into it the design that make it so user friendly.Major features of this computer are the illuminated keyboard, the built-in iSight camera (which is really fun especially with kids), built-in Bluetooth, and its ultra-sharp LCD screen make it very attractive to someone looking to buy a new computer.","Furthermore, a bluetooth module is included, allowing you to use wireless devices, such as keyboards and mice, plus sync devices such as a mobile phone.Value - The increased value of this updated Powerbook G4 is one of the things that make it very appealing.","The battery last\u0027s long and the rest of the computer is easy to use :) ENJOY! :) I love this computer! Easy to read keyboard, has both the \u0027slide finger mouse\u0027 and the red button mouse, very well thought out features make it very user friendly.","The trackpad and keyboard are the BEST I\u0027ve ever used; very smooth and accurate.","This could be a fluke, but I don\u0027t miss what I\u0027ve never used.2.The keyboard is small.","The keyboard layout is very comfortable.I can say in this price you won\u0027t find any model with Centrino processor and with the quality of Toshiba..","The keyboard on the toshiba feels quite uncomfortable.","I use this machine as my DVD player on the air plane for entertainment.Because it is wide screen, I don\u0027t feel the screen is too small.The keyboard is very comfortable.","Another benefit of the LED backlighting is the fact that it makes the lid so slim.* The keyboard has a great, tactile feel to it, which is unusual for a notebook of this size.","I can go to the internet and word and write a paper without every touching the keyboard.","It\u0027s very lightweight and easy to carry, but still powerful enough to be a desktop replacement.Pros: Lots of computer for the money: Core Duo processor, 120GB SATA, 1GB RAM, beautiful widescreen display, Vista Home PremiumCons: Keyboard layout is odd to make room for the never-used multimedia control keys, difficult to downgrade from Vista to XP (took many hours to find correct drivers), headphone jack in front makes it hard to use in cramped spaces such as an airplane.","The screen resolution, the touch of the metal, lighted keyboard, the easy to use software suites, all a 50 on a scale of 1 to 10.","Feel of the keyboard is great too.","Besides that, it is just a really, really nice computer... the little details like the illuminated keyboard, the automatic brightness adjustments of the screen, the tight integration of the software, the aluminum chassis, the balanced feel it has when it sits in your lap, the proportions...","The keyboard can be a little tough to read in dim lighting due to the black on silver lettering, but it isn\u0027t that big a deal to me.Overall, I would say the TX750 delivers pretty good bang for the buck, but power users may prefer one of the newer releases for the added memory and battery performance.","The keyboard and mouse stopped working a couple of months into ownership.","Great keyboard, incredible screen quality (better than my CRT), and it just performs like a dream.I tried the DVD TV-out connection and it really doesn\u0027t work well on my TV.","I mainly use it for Office, IE, a few strategy games, sync with my IPAQ, sync with my IPOD, burn DVDs and CDs, whatch DVDS, listen to Audiobooks, Outlook, and digital pictures editing and managing.Cons : runs hot after a while (one of the ventilation slots on the bottom), keyboard a little bit cramped but you get used to it after a while, only 40gb HD - could have bigger options (will buy an external VAIO HD) thinking about it, I prefer small and light with an external HD at home or even take it with you on your trips, so this is not such a bad deal.In conclusion :This is a great little machine.","I can just imagine the previous person who reviewed this item slaming the lid closed, or puching the keyboard hard, or using the stylus with a deathgrip and pressing down HARD, or hitting the monitor with a club...","Other than web browsing and some small Photoshop projects the card is utterly useless.Enough of the bad, on the flipside, the processor is fast despite HT, the keyboard is big and comfortable, the electronic touch pad is nice and responsive.","Like I mentioned, the keyboard layout is the same, and getting accustomed to the trackpad took just a few moments.","There are 3 fans on the bottom and a huge heat sink in the back.I would have liked to see a separate keypad since Toshiba had the room to put one in, but the overall feel of the full-size keyboard is good.","He has an infectious laugh, and I would like to tickle him, LMAO.I guess I just outed myself, ROFL!!!This is my first notebook, so I have nothing to compare it with.I type by touch, so I was concerned about the keyboard.","It has an incredibly bright screen, easy to use built in VAIO software, reasonable (though a bit crowded) keyboard, built in wireless, bluetooth, WWAN and a CD/DVD double layer drive.","I\u0027m not a computer aficianato or anything, but I was surprised to see so many negative reviews of this computer.I love the keyboard.","Then it\u0027ll turn on and blast me with volume all of the sudden.-After a year of owning it the keyboard started having weird problems.","Also its neat that it comes with a bult in card reader for up to seven different kinds of memory cards so no adapters are ever needed for this one, The keyboard has a excellent feel to it and the keys are well spaced and its nice having a seperate keypad.","The keyboard/trackpad design, in particular, is very good...full size dedicated page navigation keys, a dedicated key to bring up contextual menus, another one to call up the Start menu, a two-button trackpad with scrolling support...Battery life has been solid, the screen is sharp and the built-in SD card slot matches the format used by my digital camera.On the down side...as expected, battery life hasn\u0027t quite matched the published specs and the optical drive is a bit noisy.For an extra $230US, Toshiba added a 3 year warranty with \u0026quot;express\u0026quot; pickup/delivery and coverage against accidental damage.","Because this is a 12.1\" laptop, the keyboard is a but scrunched, though surprisingly not too bad! The battery extends out a little in the back, but not too much.There are 3 USB ports located on the right side of the laptop, next to the CD/DVD writer, with the power plug at the rear of the right side.","Superb quality, beautiful super-bright screen with good viewing angles, doesn\u0027t get hot like most notebooks, fantastic design that slips in between documents and you don\u0027t even notice it, good battery life given the power (I average 3 1/2 hours with regular use and wireless on), light weight, fast wifi connections, tiny power adapter and great feeling full-size keyboard that is backlit for work in low lighting.","Only needs a Shift key on the right side to be complete.- Fingerprint reader is VERY helpful for logging in to Windows, web sites, email... no need to use keyboard then! :)- It is portable enough to have with you \"almost\" all of the time.- Solid state disk doesn\u0027t seem to slow down when it is \"getting full\", and no need to defrag (SHOULDN\u0027T defrag, since SSD has limited # writes).- The overall \"feel\" is very good - seems quite solid and robust, well built.- Hi-res screen makes icons/pictures look really sharp.Cons- Hi-res screen makes icons/text really small.","The laptop seems sturdy but the keyboard is noisy and looks/feels very delicate.","The keyboard has a great feel when typing.","I would take my sharp over the Sony\u0027s any day!! I don\u0027t like the keyboard layout as well as some other models.","The good stuff everyone talks about: great OS, good keyboard feel, beautiful screen, nice power cord and connection, and generally quiet operation.","I have had issues with that also, but that is for a different post.The keyboard is one of the worst ones I have had to deal with even on a laptop.","Over four years later it is still going very strong.Great keyboard, light (even today), thin (even today), fairly fast, well-built screen tilting mechanism.","That is, I couldn\u0027t find anything that included all of the of the following: 1\" thick profile, but with an extremely sturdy titanium case (that doesn\u0027t flex); 15.1\" screen, and a dazzline one at that; slot-loading CD/DVD drive that writes both CD\u0027s and DVD\u0027s; long-battery life (3 - 4 hrs.); sturdy keyboard with decent tactile feel and minimal flex; built-in Bluetooth; built-in Firewire; built-in wireless networking (AirPort)I found machines that offered maybe two or three of these, but none that had them all.","Keyboard becomes completely unresponsive seemingly randomly and without any warning.","I really like the display resolution, the widescreen, the backlit keyboard.","i think, if you own a toshiba and live in America, AMERICANS SHOULD HELP YOU!! Whatver country you live in, thats where your representative should be from! I dont know when theyll get my laptop repaired, I think they give you the run around till your warranty runs up or till you get tired, then go pay a repairman by yourself I am totally satisfied with the size, screen, keyboard layout, and ease of portability provided by my new Toshiba.","The built-in keyboard is easy to use, mostly with thumbs, but a touch typist can bring in other fingers to increase speed.","I do games, audio, web and graphics development, work - until last month, I was all PC all the time.With that said, this is one of the most solid, stylish, functional and FUN - yes FUN - devices I\u0027ve ever owned! The performance, usability, feature set and reliability is peerless and I would be hard pressed to find such touches as a lighted keyboard, magnetic AC power, built in camera, hard drive drop protection, firewire 800, Express card, auto dimming LCD, Ati x1600 graphics, Wifi, Bluetooth, DVI, slot load superdrive, included media remote and the plethora of software features as standard in a portable, affordable PC package.","Don\u0027t feel guilty, it\u0027ll pay for itself!Pete I own SZ140p model for about 1 month.Pros:- Screen size and display quality are very nice.- I\u0027m happy with the embedded webcam, it is very convenient to use with a chat client.- Lightweight, think, and sleekCons:- Space key on the keyboard is really annoying.","It also has microphone/headphone jacks, S-Video out, serial, parallel and infrared ports.One point of interest on these laptops is that they do not have touchpads, only an eraser-nub pointer in the middle of the keyboard.","Besides, after having two warped keys, I need a new keyboard anyways.Endorsed by GI Joe.","And the craftsmanship, including the keyboard, so far surpasses Dell that the earlier reviewer\u0027s assertion to the contrary seems inexplicable.","Though I was happy during first few months, this laptop started giving me lot of problems...Here are the pros and cons of it:Pros:1) Awesome screen clarity (Xbrite technology)2) Keyboard and Touchpad are really nice.3) Good Performance...no need to wonder as it\u0027s pentium 4 2.8 ghz, 512 MB RAM.4) It has memorystick slot, nice to have if you have a sony digital camera.Cons:1) It\u0027s heavy, heavy, too heavy for a laptop.2) It comes with a large size brick i.e) the power adaptor...aweful even a B grade brands are giving very small adaptors...3) The sound quality is terrible.4) No external control of volume/brightness etc.","Like IBMs have had for a long time, this one has a little keyboard illuminator that I think is a very nice touch.","I didn\u0027t like the keyboard in the beginning but overtime it came into my habit.","Another issue I was not very found of was the fact, that sony does not send you any software/cd\u0027s, so a word of advise as soon as you take the thing out of the box, following the instruction make the system restore cd\u0027s they recommend.My experience with the keyboard is very good as well.","ACTUALLY, the glidepad is in exactly the RIGHT place for the regular keyboard, which is left of the numeric keypad.","The keyboard will spoil the user, with excellent size and tactile feedback.XP is an excellent OS, requiring less muscle for the job, so a \"slower\" laptop actually performs well.","The keyboard itself on the macbook works just as well as any other keyboard.","It is not a laptop/notebook (those would be larger and have a nearly-full-sized keyboard).","The screen may be small, but it\u0027s beautiful, the keyboard is not as cramped as it should be for a computer of this size/weight and, by far the best part: it is incredibly light at 3.6 lbs.","Personally I would have liked them to extend the keyboard south into the wrist area to accomodate that but they didn\u0027t.","The keyboard and screen are nice, and so is the aluminum body.","Still, the keyboard is difficult to use, and the touchpad is scaring me with flakyness.","The keyboard is very much like a MacBook \"Chiclet\" style keys.Other reviewers have commented on the speakers, this is the one weak point.","Especially the speech recognition program which allows you to use your computer without even touching the keyboard but by only by dictating through a microphone (i.e.: \"Start Documents\" \"Open pictures\".. or \"Start Word\" and then just dictate a whole document!!!)Everything is great about this laptop, the keyboard which is very smooth, the screen wide and so clear it gives you a home cinema experience when watching movies.","I use the keyboard and touchpad all day without problems.","One of our computers is dead from this so we cannibalized it to keep the others going longer (screen to one, keyboard to another, adapter to a third (you get the idea).Todate of the original four, we have only one that is still usable.","heavy little thing but thats why its a tough book (a) Best keyboard ever made for laptops, (b) Decent speed, runs Office 2007 O.k., (c) Acceptable graphics (ATI 7500) or good graphics (ATI 9000 / 9600 / FireGL, the latter 2 can play Far Cry 1.0), (d) Thinklight is very useful on overseas plane flights, (e) fits perfectly on all airplane tray tables, (f) Outstanding battery life with CD-battery + 9-cell (5-6 hrs if you dim the screen), (g) It actually sleeps and wakes up properly unlike 50% of all laptops, and (h) You can just grab it and run to a conference room, yanking it out of the minidock, and it will sleep properly, unlike newer (T60, T400) machines where you have to hit a key first !!DONT buy anything with less than 1.8 Ghz processor as the 1.7 Ghz and lower have a smaller cache(2MB vs 3MB) and are about 33% slower.I have used about 4x of these machines at work over the past 6 years.","It feels very strong and I love the keyboard feeling.","Perhaps they get theirs made especially for them and cut corners? That said, I have heard alot of complaints about the customer service practices of Sony even though I havent had to deal with them (yet).Pros: The machine looks great, the screen is bright and crisp, the perfomance is fairly good, ample USB slots, the integrated GMA900 vid card works well for most games, keyboard is nice and stiff, its amazingly thin, DLDVD+-RW/CD+-RW is handy, it runs silent and never gets more than a bit warm.Cons: Headphone/Audio out jack is in an inconvienient spot (front), the white colour gets dirty, no video out without the purchase of a docking station, slightly on the heavy side.","Second, on the keyboard the shift key broke.","For example, I like the keyboard feel, but not the location of the Delete key, which sits next to the cursor arrow keys.","The poorly designed keyboard may require changing habits and new key memorization from standard notebook keyboards.","Get a gig and try selling the 512.Other thoughts about this computer: The keyboard is cheap feeling, but it is functional.","It also weighs 9 pounds, 9 ounces (I think there is 16 oz. in a pound).Needless to say, I was very happy with the long life of my machine.I once spilled soda (dr. pepper) into the keyboard.","The keyboard feels amazing.","It was easy - just remove the keyboard (see above) to place 1GB there, and take off the bottom plate for the memory slot there to replace that with the other 1GB.","And, what about the very, very, very convenient Windows key on the keyboard?! Thinkpads still seem to think it\u0027s ok to skip those.","I especially like the shortcuts provided in the keyboard to start/stop the disc player.","you can easily find a cheaper one in dell or lenovo.My ratings(out of 5 star):keyboard: *****weight: *****screen: ****OS: ***price:**durability: ** ( This is a guess as I havent spent enough time yet) All aspects of getting this computer went seamlessly.","I like that you can control the volume with the touch of a finger just above the keyboard (also from here you can stop, play, pause, mute, etc).","Then, with the help of a cordless keyboard, mouse, and monitor extension cable, you can locate the laptop several feet away from you and still enjoy Pentium 4 speed on your desk top.","The screen is bright, crisp, and easy to read and the keyboard is better than any laptop (and even some desktop) keyboards I\u0027ve ever used.","Other than that--it\u0027s extremely fast, very light, keyboard size and play are great, I have no complaints.","The keyboard feels great and looks nice and sturdy.The tough thing about buying a laptop is you have to get one that doesn\u0027t only meet your needs now, but also will meet your needs in 3 years because you can\u0027t simply upgrade parts that get old.","The area just above the keyboard gets so hot, I am affraid to close the lid untill it cools down a bit.","After one year, two keys fell off the keyboard.","Here\u0027s my spin:PROs* 15in display (also nice quality images)* Battery life (I get 3 hrs when set to \u0026quot;long life\u0026quot;)* USB 2.0* Overall quality build (keyboard \u0026amp; display especially nice)* Some nice features: 40GB/CDRW+DVD/56K+NICCONs (these are really just quibbles)* Only 2 USB ports (my last Satellite had 3)* USB port orientation (vertical is tough fit for some USB drives)* Integrated graphics (Not really an issue for non-gamers)* CDRW speed (does it really get the full 8X?)* 256MB RAM (you\u0027ll definitely want to upgrade within 6mths)As I said, the CONs are really just quibbles.","This is a small laptop, and the keyboard is spread nicely on it, but it is still cramped.","The illuminated keyboard is nice to have too.","About 1 month after receiving the laptop the screen would go black for no reason and the keyboard would phantomly type.","The sony guy said that unlike other keyboards it\u0027s not fully fastened down.","I like the new keyboard.","The keyboard is very light and provides minimal tactile feedback.","Seriously, my husband just bought me the computer and a week later he spilled a 16oz glass of water all over the keyboard and below.","The keyboard has a great look and feel to it as well.","On the other hand, the keyboard is definately done wrong.","They added another set of up-down-right-left arrows to the keyboard and they accomplished it by shrinking the Shift, point and forward slash keys to half their size.","Everything about it screams \"cheap\", from the lousy keyboard, to the nearly non-functional touch pad (it constantly jumps around, causing you to lose just-typed text).","The screen is clear, the keyboard is responsive and the quick buttons at the top of the keyboard eliminate steps as well as room on the Taskbar or desktop.","you can easily set the trackpad to left click, right click, and scroll+pretty quiet keyboard.","When I fall asleep at the keyboard, I seem to be incapable of turning it off, and usually shut the lid and fall asleep on the lid (with the computer on).My 26 lb MaineCoon Cat takes care of the abuse.","I tried it and it\u0027s got great usability, the keyboard is very comfortable (standard-sized), easy-to-read screen.","Negative things? OK, the split Qwerty buttons are small, but the on-screen keyboad (and the USB keyboard on order) suppresses that frustration.","It has also gotten a companion External Hard Drive, An Upgrade to 2GBs of memory and a wireless keyboard and mouse.","It has a huge, clear, bright display, good resolution, a comfortable keyboard, decent sound output, a powerful processor, plenty of RAM and HD space, one of the best ethernet cards around.","Their response was to offer me a derisory 10% discount on the cost of repairs.Then, about a month later, the screen flickered briefly and died completely! I was left with an expensive laptop that was effectively reduced to a desktop machine that could only be used with an external keyboard and an external monitor.So, here was a laptop that had been used carefully for about five hours a day, in a benign environment, had never suffered any kind of physical damage, and had only been taken out of the house on a handful of occasions, and yet had developed two major faults in the space of just sixteen months! Sony\u0027s response to my complaints was simply to argue that their machines \"are some of the most reliable available on the market\".Not one, but two major faults in just over a year.","I thought this model was a little newer, I guess not, it works good and does what it has to however it was much to my surprise to not have a windows key on the keyboard.","Since my laptop is so attractive, I am constantly pleased when using it.I have not had a single complaint or problem with this sexy little baby.The keyboard is such a luxury to use.","After reviewing offerings from Dell, Ibm, HP and IBM determined that for the money the Toshiba was the best if my budget was less than $2000.Good features: (1) speed, (2) everything works, (3) good screen; (4) very good video card, I run the native screen plus a 24\" dell monitor with no problem.Poor features: Keyboard layout is strange.","The full-size keyboard retains it terrific feel, and the expanded 14.1\u0026quot; display on the top-of-the-line T22 is exceptionally crisp and bright.","This by itself becomes a crash course on using the little screen, keyboard and mouse.","Also, the keyboard is very noisy.Now the worst thing, it\u0027s the customer service.","She has learned those extra features very gradually.)She finds the keyboard comfortable, and navigation easy to understand.","I want to buy this product with Turkish keyboard and I want to pay in 12 months with my credit card.Is it possible?Is the guarrantie available in turkey? I want to like this computer.","The screen seems brighter than the previous one, and the new keyboard backlighting is beautiful.I also like the fact that, besides increasing the base amount of memory, Apple now ships the machines with one memory slot open.","The following are the pros and cons...Pros...+ Super simple set-up -- took me less than half an hour to open the box, configure the system, and establish an internet connection through my home-based, WEP enabled 802.11g wireless network+ Stunning graphics display (1200 X 800 resolution is awesome!)+ Lightening fast handling of MS office applications (a 60 day trial version of MS office -- Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint is pre-loaded)+ Fit and finish are BMW-like (i.e., high speed, low drag)+ Extremely nice touch for Sony to have preloaded a decent anti-spyware application (SpySubtract)and Norton Security (3 month trial version)+ A couple reviewers have maligned the 128 MB Intel graphics card, but using an idependent test site (pcpitstop.com), the graphics card received extremely high marks+ Over-all configuration/performance are similar to machines costing several hundred more (somewhat unusal for a premium brand like Sony)+ Keyboard action is sweeeet -- so is the big and fat 100GB hard drive (can\u0027t ever imagine having the content to fill it up!)+ Comsumer\u0027s Union (publisher of Consumer Reports) continually gives Sony high marks for build qualityCons...+ Sony\u0027s knucklheaded bean-counters decided to save money by equipping the machine with a 7 foot power cord -- I have never (and I mean never ever) seen a machine in this price tier come with such a short powercord (my Dell that I use for work came with a 12 foot powercord); I now have to make a 2nd trip to the store to rectify this albiet small, but nevertheless disappointing shortcoming+ I am surprised that the built in speakers are just this side of acceptable (that\u0027s okay as I live for searching Amazon for fun peripherals!)+ I am also somewhat surprised that there are so few hot (a.k.a. quick connect) buttons for multi-media and internet apps (just two!) -- many other machines come with half a dozen or more+ Would like to see more free software preloaded (this seems to be an issue with most of Sony\u0027s machines: laptop and desktop; high end and low end)+ Touch pad takes a little getting used to (not quite sensitive enough at the default setting)Hope this helped with your search for a new machine! Never again will I buy anything Toshiba.","512MB of RAM is OK, but it\u0027s cheap to upgrade.It weighs about 3.3 lbs without the second battery (you can use two batteries at the same time for about 5 hours of runtime), so the form factor is excellent and the keyboard is not too compressed.","Although not specified, I believe sony also included their WEGA style Anamorphic technology into the screen as well (about 2/3 of my wide-screen DVDs play full screen on the notebook).The keyboard layout is nice.","When I took the machine to a Toshiba-authorized repair center, they replaced the motherboard and keyboard, but put the (previously working) mousepad in upside down and never got it to work again.","40 Gig not enough for you? Then archive your files by burning them in the build in CD-recorder (DVD/CDR)The keyboard feels solid and comfortable.","Didn\u0027t think they could improve from the iBook keyboard, but they did with the Macbook, put it in the air and added backlighting.","Remove the two OEM sticks of RAM and replace them with two 512mb pc2700 333mhz chips, and then replace the OEM 4200rpm HDD with a Hitachi Travelstar 7K100 80gb 7200rpm HDD and - Vola\u0027! - instant hotrod computer for a decent price (and with a superb screen to boot)! Tanks John I love this computer took me a little while to get used to working on it, just can use the pad is puhing the button in the middle of the keyboard disable the pad because I use a usb mouse \u0026 moving my hands across the pad causes the poniter to jump all over, I got tape over the pad \u0026 it helps Thanks again TARGET MARKET: Student/Casual UserPRICE RANGE: Entry-LevelBUILD - 4/5 - Very sturdy and solid.","It is the Best ThinkPad Yet! This is my 5th one since they first announced them in the early 1990\u0027s.Athough advertised as Win XP Pro, mine came with Windows Vista Business;and Office 2007 (30-Trial).1 GB is not nearly enough to run Vista, but this robust machine supports up to 3GB of PC5300 memory; which believe it or not cost below $200 to max out the memory!It is the heaviest laptop that I have every carried, but considering the Beautiful HD type Widescreen and Keyboard, it is worth lugging around those extra kilo\u0027s.","The keyboard is excellente to write and the screen very good.","The large screen and keyboard (yes, it has a dedicated 10-key pad!) take up some space.","I just bought an external keyboard iii) USB ports refuse to recognize my external mouse a lot of times.","The keyboard is set back and there is plenty of room to rest your palms on it.The wireless works great and I was able to connect to my Dlink gamer with no problemo.","I\u0027d rather go without paying my heat bill than taking back the air!The Good- The industrial design and size/weight.- The screen- The keyboard- The overall feeling of a supremely engineered product- It\u0027s a Mac and it comes with Leopard and iLife 08- The tradeoffs they made to fit the size/weight requirements are fine with me and largely non-issues (\u0026 my issues can be fixed)- If you buy it you will love it (ps - I am not connected with Apple in any way)Interestingly while I have a number of issues with the product I think they could all be easily fixed into the future making the \"Air\" a true 10x product.","Great keyboard and screen too! Built in battery doesn\u0027t give you too much juice, but the included spare will provide you plenty of time.Unfortunately I will be returning it because of a serious issue for me - the WiFi reception is extremely poor.","But the keys on the keyboard gets stuck.","Since for as little as $100 one can add a bluetooth foldable keyboard, this is one great little machine to use.The UX280 comes with Win XP SP2, and anyone concerned by Vista should snap up one of these while they are still available (and half the price of the UX380).","The size and weight are perfect, and the keyboard is not difficult to use, but I was surprised that I paid over $2000 for a computer that only include Microsoft Works.","Portrait-right mode is the best for right-handed since the lower edge is clear of gadgets.- the split keyboard is not very good.","Plus, the hybrid system to expand the battery life is just CLEVER reinvention! However, went to try at local electronics store and don\u0027t like the keyboard feel and the look of those buttons(i.e. power buttons and stuff).","It has 4 USB 2.0 ports on the right side so adding a mouse is no problem.Pros:Price vs Features (although it has gone up since I bought it), Processor Speed, HD Display Screen, HD Size, SuperMulti DVD player, Biometric reader, 6 USB 2.0!!!, all ports are on front and sides for easy access, attractive case, numeric pad on keyboard, rich sounding speakers, runs cooler on the bottom then my Dell laptops (heat is vented to the sides)Cons:Weight, AC Adapter converter is the size of a brick!, price of buying a second adapter is expensive.UPDATE: A couple of things.","Slow compared to other HD\u0027s with higher rpm (5400, 7200, etc).- White keyboard.","I\u0027ll break my review into three sections; General Comments, Pros and Cons.General Comments:- Processor: AMD Turion 64 Processor TL64- Memory: 2GB- Screen Size: 15.4\"- Hard Drive 200GB- OS: Vista Premium- Video: Nvidia GeForce Go 7400Pros:- QuickPlay: Lets you play DVD\u0027s, Videos \u0026 Music without having to have the computer booted.- QuickPlay Buttons: Above the keyboard there are touch sensitive buttons for stopping, playing, pausing and volume levels while using QuickPlay.- QuickPlay Remote: Comes with a mini remote that stores in the ExpressCard port for use with QuickPlay.- USB Ports: It\u0027s got three USB ports which is good for most needs.- DVD+RW DL LightScribe Burner (What else could you ask for?)- Integrated WebCam/Microphone (Works good with Yahoo \u0026 MSN)Cons:- Preinstalled software, demos and junk!!! OMG, I was watching something on CNET and they were saying that new computers are overloaded with preinstalled software, but this is ridicules.","Even IBM (I admit IBM has solid case and keyboard) is not as good as Toshiba in building multimedia laptops with perfect speakers.","I wrote my doctoral dissertation on it, using the docking station to hook up to a large monitor and standard keyboard after coming home from the university every day.","The machine\u0027s design is wonderful: the backlit keyboard, the glowing apple on the lid, even the power cord balances form and function nicely.There are a few areas that have room for improvement.","The review would have been more favorable earlier, but you got to consider in terms of today\u0027s technology, would people want to get this laptop, so that is what I based my review on.Pros:------decent speakers for notebook speakers-decent sound quality on headphones-fast enough processor-great feel on keyboard \u0026 touchpad-external monitor support-PC card expansion slot-screen is bright and sharp-decent budget laptop I guess...-fairly rugged and durable, reliableCons:------glossy screen glare annoying in bright places-uneven backlighting becomes annoyingly obvious when watching DVD movies in a dark place-wireless card in the laptop is intermittent, not much of a problem when just surfing the web, but a major issue when using streaming video/audio content, or playing online games, which both require a constant connection-short battery life even on minimal use-slow \u0026 limited RAM really drasticaly affects performance, lots of page file usage (over 500MB at times!!!) makes things slow when loading or switching applications.","But open the lid and you see a beautiful bright 14 inch widescreen with a full-size keyboard - no cramping your fingers for space.","The keyboard never worked right (lots of dropped keystrokes) so I sent it back and got another unit.","One day smoke was coming from laptop keyboard.","Heat is another problem - this machine not only gets way too hot to comfortably hold on your lap for any length of time, but I find that the heat seeps through the keyboard and at the end of the day I end up with numb fingers.","The keyboard is also of the material that gets \"shiny\" after some use.","The keyboard is comfortable and well laid out.The software that comes with the machine is very good, especially if you are moving from network to network.","speakers point down from front of laptop, which projects into my lap and then into the computer where it makes it sound like music is comming out of the keyboard.","The keyboard is very comfortable for high intensity writing, the screen is bright (and not overly glossy), and the backlit keyboard is fun.","(aside from the quite cheap quality of the keyboard area..","However, when the computer was just over 14 months old (not quite three months out of warranty), the keyboard failed completely, and I had to purchase an external USB keyboard to be able to continue using it.","There are so many wonderful features of this laptop - the screen, the memory, the video card, the dual-core processor, the volume control on the keyboard (you will never be able to be without it again) - but unfortunately HP decided to throw in some cheap components too.","One small additional note: the keyboard is rather slick;

the first had to be returned because the touchpad mysteriously stopped working and the keyboard began functioning irregularly (it developed a three second lag began typing and the characters being shown on the screen.)","The other Thinkpad feature I\u0027m missing is the LED keyboard light, so that you can illuminate the keys in a darkened room or airplane.","The display backlighting is also as bright as when it was purchased, as well as the backlit keyboard.","It does not have some thinkpad trademarks, like the \"nipple\", but what it does makes it a great buy: a solid build, a thinkpad-like keyboard, large hd, good parts, acceptable screen, and a very good battery - plus dvd-rw which is really good.","Keyboard is very comfortable and I was surprised at how much I ended up using the fingerprint reader for logging on to websites.","I refuse to carry anything heavier, and it also looks good! It also compares favorably in design and size to the very best ultra-portable laptops available today.The keyboard has a good typing layout IMHO, and excellent tactile feel.","The keyboard is solid and easy to use.","My only gripe is the shrunken Shift and Forward Slash keys on the right side of the keyboard.","My HP sounded like a Turbine Generator spinning in the wind..seriously, it was loud.The Laptop gives you many options to conserve power, from adjusting screen brightness to adjusting the computer\u0027s capabilities while running on battery...niftyOnly quirk is the keyboard..its a bit off center, but we\u0027ll just have to (GOSH DARNIT) adjust!!..haha My Toshiba notebook broke and they claim they fixed it because they sent it back within a day, but they didn\u0027t send back my power cord.","Woo, I have to say the mac os is much better than windows xp.Unluckly, I have an issue about the keyboard.","The keyboard is quiet and the fan is quiet.","Make sure to turn off that NATIVE SATA SUPPORT or XP will blue screen you.If this machine did not have such a crappy keyboard, and not so many MB issues, it would be one excellent deal.","In my opinion Samsung should have delivered it with the organizer case and a keyboard, but I fully understand they wanted to keep costs low on it.All in all it\u0027s a winner.","No dead pixels.-Keyboard.","In that same vein, there\u0027s the G4 Powerbook\u0027s keyboard that automatically lights up with a soft glow from underneath the keys as the light in your office or your airplane cabin dims.","My Dell B130 works well as any other Dell I have had on the past (about 4) - However, I know its keyboard will fail within 1 year or so.","The laptop itself has a big LiveStrong logo on the lid and the keyboard has a Lance Armstrong autograph (simulation) in the lower right hand corner.","I have had a few challenges getting the ($349) FireWire drive to work property with Norton\u0027s Ghost 2006.I do most of my serious typing with the UX280 while it\u0027s in the port replicator and connected to an external display, keyboard and mouse.","The keyboards on the other two were fine, by the way.","I use an IBM Model M keyboard on my desktop so I know what good tactile feedback should feel like.* touchpad works well* suspend/resume takes about 2 secondsIssues:* the webcam is ok, not the greatest, but I don\u0027t use it anyway* when I bought the laptop (2007) Linux did not have drivers for wireless.","The DVD buttons above the keyboard turn it from a great laptop to an easy very portable DVD player.Comes with plenty of ports (USB, Ethernet, etc.)Some people may not like the fact that Sony is partial to their own stuff and only has their memory stick drive and doesn\u0027t include the standard one.","Suggestion to IBM, move the Fn key between the Ctrl and Alt keys like standard Windows keyboards have the Windows Start key.","I like the keyboard and display.","I have been trying to review and revise my own keyboarding habits to overcome this problem, but so far without much luck.","With time, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll adjust to pushing harder, but I wish this keyboard had the soft, accurate touch my old Toshiba had.Pros:*Despite Toshiba\u0027s warnings about burning yourself, this model actually gets far less hot than my old one.","Plus it runs windows (if you must) It\u0027s time IBM woke up and noticed that the market has caught up with its sole laurel of a spiffy keyboard.","Check how much the keyboards flex, screen hinges wobble, etc.","Depending on your usage, a small bluetooth keyboard may be a wise choice.","The most fun I\u0027ve had using a PC for many years.The performance is surprisingly good and I run Office apps, video, all the usual applications and web stuff with no problem at all and no lag.The keyboard is a poor design and how Sony missed the common sense of tactile keys is mind-boggling until you remember, oh yeah - it\u0027s Sony.","The keyboard is very loud for me as a touch typist and the keys are not designed well to give user a nice feedback when I type really fast.","As an added benefit, every keys on the keyboard are painted in aluminum alloy to give more complete metallic look and feel.Other notable improvements include:- 1.25 GHz G4 processor (10-25% faster than 1 GHz predecessor)- AirPort Extreme (802.11g) and Bluetooth- USB 2.0 and FireWire 800- Faster 167 MHz FSB with DDR RAM support- Up to 2 GB of DDR RAM- ATI Mobility Radeon 9600 graphics card- Backlit keyboard- 3 speakersLast generations of PowerMac G4s lacked many bleeding edge technologies (e.g., PCI Express, Serial ATA).","(Backlight keyboard, Brightness, etc) The trackpad is ALOT better than what i thought! I may just have to buy the wireless trackpad soon.","This should be a 7 stars product, even on a 5 star scale but... even when i like Sony, i can\u0027t understand why such an advanced and innovative company can make earing aid buds at least for internal use.PP highly reliable, uncomparable performance, neat design, light weight, wonderful LCD display, most secure, comfortable keyboard with great touching point, ...you don\u0027t have to worry that you are careless to drop it accidentally; i did that many times and it continue works well.","Still, the current XGA TFT is better in a Toshiba laptop than some of the others that I had looked into.The placement of keys in the keyboard is not exactly to my liking.","It is small enough to fit into a pocket of my brief case and light enough when undocked.My only problem so far is the small shift key on the right side of the keyboard.","I have tried to slow this machine down with many programs running-cannot do it! Decent screen, nice full size keyboard, touchpad is ok, but I got a wireless mouse.","I wonder if it\u0027s because the DVD player is on that side? The left side of the keyboard feels studier.","Large screen size is nice, and keyboard is comfortable.","The further bad news was that I had to reinstall windows before they would replace the keyboard, to make sure it wasn\u0027t a driver issue...although this made sense to me at the time, I now realize they should have had this issue in their database, and should not have put me thru that exercise...on the other hand my wife also has a dv8000 series machine and that keyboard is perfect.","First the good things.The thing is small and light and fits in almost any carry-on bigger than a purse.Battery lasts forever 6 hours playing DVD or games is routine.No port-replicator is needed.Wireless works well.Now, the less good things...The keyboard is a bit cramped for big typing jobs.The DVD isn\u0027t the smoothest player of movies etc, but it isn\u0027t bad.Would I buy another? Absolutely.","Some Thinkpads have a very cool blue light coming out of the top of the display that illuminates the keyboard but the Powerbook 12\" didn\u0027t have any such thing.","I also like the keyboard and how it lights up in darker rooms.","Having previously used an IBM Thinkpad, and hearing iffy things about the Sony keyboard, I was a little concerned but there were no problems adjusting.","Once for the keyboard and the other time for the cd-drive.","Amazon has a folding Bluetooth keyboard for $29 which is a great option for this machine.Audio is impressive, nice and loud.Wifi is great, it connects much faster than my Dell XPS notebook and never drops a signal.The device boots in under a minute and wakes from sleep in around 12 seconds (including connecting to wifi).The screen is perfect; great resolution and extremely bright and sharp.Heat is an issue.","The keyboard is the most comfortable of all the laptops I\u0027ve used, although I did buy a wireless mouse which is a big help when going from a PC to a laptop.","Removing the battery got it booting again, after it failed to talk to the keyboard, but now USB isn\u0027t working.I broke my own rule by purchasing hardware that came bundled with a new operating system release.What kind of machine should I replace this with?The machine would\u0027ve been better with XP, since Vista fails on two counts:1) imposes mandatory DRM restrictions on hardware2) requires newer, \u0027beta\u0027-quality driversMany of these weren\u0027t even available by May 2007Vista shipped in January 2007No other hardware else I purchased with the machine worked day 1.","I thought my G-4 was fast, but the new Core 2 Duo is awesome! Keyboard is very responsive and a vast improvement over my old Mac laptop.","The keyboard has a wonderful feel to it.","Its screen is bright, keyboard is great and the new ultra-nav is awesome! Wireless is a bit low on reception compared to the cards but is improving with each software upgrade.","Besides ALL THE WORLD is accustomed to find this key in the lower section of a keyboard, just beside space bar !However it haven\u0027t avoided to buy this Laptop if I had known all of this before!, this is a great computer! Nice and small.","The touchpad is very buggy and uncooperative, and clicks backward, forward, up, down, sideways (you get the idea)...After reading that other reviewers had similar issues I also noticed the keyboard was not seated very well in its basin.","This computer is fast enough to take care of the average user, too.Features I enjoy include:* Built-in webcam and mic - something I believe all laptops will have soon* Numeric keypad beside the qwerty keyboard - makes life easy when entering a lot of numbers.* Lightscribe - allows for direct disc labeling* Mousepad on/off switch - no worries about hands dragging on it accidentally anymore* Scrollbar on mousepad - makes for faster webpage navigationI actually enjoy the mousepad more than previous reviewers - I do not have any problems with sticky fingers, I suppose! Also, the buttons under the mousepad have a great feel to them as well.","I dropped mine any number of times without suffering screen, keyboard, or other problems.\u003d\u003d The Bad \u003d\u003dAt 166 MHz and 64 MB max RAM, it\u0027s not suitable for anything past Win98 (I recommend the most recent Win95, if you have disks).The optical drive is read only (no burning) and is painfully slow compared ot more recent versions.2.1 GB of storage doesn\u0027t leave room for much (this will not be your MP3 storage device).For modern internet, you\u0027ll also need some type of PC Card ($40-100) and there\u0027s no USB built-in.\u003d\u003d The Ugly \u003d\u003dAs much as I love this machine, it\u0027s not worth more than $50 in my opinion.","Lo and behold I discover that OS 10 allows me the option of changing my keyboard from English to Spanish [or German or any one of scores of other languages] and thus I can type the Spanish punctuation [upside down question marks, for example].I also had occasion to set up bluetooth devices on a PC and on my Powerbook.","Most PC laptops are black in color, but this one is silver and black, which looks very cool.The keyboard is easy to type on as well, but sometimes I notice that while typing, my cursor appears to reposition itself messing up my typing.","People look at it and say \"wow\".But, why would anybody pay more than $2,000. for this computer when a machine (even a laptop) with larger capacity, bigger screen, more USB ports, more memory, larger hard drive, better warranty and less expensive parts can bought for much less?The answer is: a footprint smaller than a letter sized sheet a paper; full networking; a built in CD/DVD drive; built in fingerprint reader; bright, high resolution screen; a seven hour battery life even when networked; more than adequate memory and hard drive suitable for all but heavy graphics; the ability to play DVD\u0027s without starting up Windows and a total weight of less than 3 pounds.My first concerns were: Can someone with \"older\" vision and reflexes actually read the screen and use the keyboard?I found that, although bright and clear, the screen is definitely small.","ThinkPads have a great tactile response to the keyboard and the multinav is convenient (once you get used to it).","Even with all that I listed, I think the move from the Ti to Al will be worth it, but that will probably until they release the G5 PowerBook in the upcoming year, and then I\u0027ll probably be kicking myself again.The increase of processor speed, USB 2.0, Bluetooth and backlit keyboard were the main reasons I upgraded.","No more of those annoying black borders that surround a horizontal screen.2.8GHz Pentium 4 is one of the fastest processors for any laptop available, and a 64MB Radeon graphics card is good for a laptop, and 512 DDR RAM is very good for a laptop as well.THE POINT IS: all these wonderful features for such a GREAT PRICE and especially for a Sony VAIO, which generally is more expensive and Sony\u0027s reputation for laptops is very good.-The full size keyboard is nice, not as crampedDRAWBACKS:-8 pounds is considered heavy for a laptop, although you would have to spend significantly more for a weaker, lighter Centrino laptop-Battery consumption is slightly high due to it\u0027s incredible processing power.However, I feel that battery consumption is a non-issue because most of the time when you\u0027re working, there are places to plug your laptop into a wall outlet.However, I do not recommend this laptop if you\u0027re constantly moving around without being close to wall outlets or are too weak to carry this laptop.","before the fan stopped, you just couldn\u0027t do anything but to wait out (and life is too short, don\u0027t you think so?}4) once the fan started, the heat exhausted from the laptop always mingled with some weird smell, like burning plastic or that smell is from the protective wrapping material around the hard drive? and why it\u0027s so hot? just because panasonic did an unique job to protect the hard drive from damage if dropped accidently from a 4-feet height? and why it\u0027s so hot? why the fan almost has to kick started so often, so randomly and so long? is it because panasonic wrappd more protective material under the keyboard from water damage? yeah, it maybe very tough, but it\u0027s also too hot to put on you lap or keep the fan quiet and not over worked.5) the screen.","Keyboard and mechanics are everything you\u0027d expect from a high-end laptop.","Why is the keyboard so small when there is all this space? The use ofmetal is a nice touch but what is the idea behind the whiteplastic area around the keyboard and touchpad? I also muchprefer the hard plastic exterior shell to the more matte finishof this machine.","Anything about the depth of a little dental floss box will do.The keyboard is fine for fast typists, good action for a laptop.It\u0027s a budget machine, don\u0027t expect sleek and light.","The keyboard is amazing and I have never had any problem with this unit what so ever.","To its credit, the door latches solidly, so I\u0027ll need to be really careless to lose it.A few quibbles: The keyboard layout is`unnecessarily odd, but it\u0027s not a big problem.","The Thinkpad has much softer edges and also has a slight tilt to the base which makes typing much more comfortable.- the keyboard feel is good but the layout is far inferior to the Thinkpad.","If this is an issue, spend a little more and get a PowerBook which has a 64 meg card.No backlighting options for the keyboard or screen.","You\u0027ll get used to it after a while, but don\u0027t be surprised when you goof to your conventional PC keyboard and find yourself lost looking for the Windows button.","If you use a Blackberry, you\u0027ll find that the Blackberry is actually easier than the Sony\u0027s keyboard - it\u0027s smaller, requiring less thumb travel.","The pros:Reasonably priced for what you get.Lightweight and compact, easy to transportGreat screen display and keyboard layoutNo problems with speed, loading programs, etc.The Cons:Gets very, very hot in and out of the case.Vista... need I say more?After 14 months, the computer wouldn\u0027t power up.","Attaching a numeric keypad is no fun; the software asks you to hit the key next to the shift key so that it can identify what type of keyboard you have attached, but of course numeric keypads have no shift key.","I use it on business travel and also when I take a break from work, by going to the local coffee shop.The letters on the keyboard are in a different kind of font and sometimes, if you look down at the keyboard, it can disorient you.","Although you will probably want to go up to a gig of memory to get all the speed out of this puppy.2) Full sized keyboard - I am used to an ergo, but this isn\u0027t bad.3) Looks - Sony has the fashion edge.","But that is just software.the keyboard is easy, responsive, and hopefully durable.","Compaq couldn\u0027t even design proper cooling for this?The laptop hard drive is very noisy and so is the flimsy keyboard.","If you try to type on this keyboard at full speed you will notice that it simply does not respond, and that letters will be missing from your writing.","also, the buttons that realease the express card slot as well as the memory card adaptor seem loose., as well as the keyboard, just doesnt seem to sit well.its a bit umfortable to have to carry aroud by hand... maybe im just paranoide but i cant seem to get a firm grip on the thing when the cover is closed.battery isnt as snug as i would like... it wiggles around still even when its locked in, but its not SO loose that the battery would fall of or anything..","In addition, the center of the keyboard flexes do to pushing on a center key.","The keyboard is much nicer than previous iBook keyboards.I am also most impressed with the versatility and intuitive operation of Mac OS X (Panther).","The trackpad has made surfing the web easier than before.Keyboard: I was hesitant about the backlit keyboard.","I can\u0027t give you too much information on what else you will run in to - I carry a full size USB keyboard in my bag, which I planned to do anyway as I am not much for laptop keyboards anyway.","Now I am just looking for some ram to beef it up.Great keyboard, sound and picture.","This iBook arrived with a keyboard problem, but I was able to get it fixed for free, because it was still under warranty.","I haven\u0027t had any monitor problems like other users have stated and I hope I don\u0027t run into that problem!*Speakers:I can\u0027t really say much about the speakers except that I like their location which is at either side of the keyboard and thus gets out of your way when you lay your wrists on the laptop.","Keyboard Layout5.","I like the feel of the keyboard too.","(Look for this to show up in all hard-drive based mp3 players)Top all that off with a full-width keyboard and what you have is a new standard in not only ultralights, but quite possibly all of portable computing.","It has nothing to do with the \"quality\" of the machine, it has more to do with how much and in what way you use your technology.Right now, my \"N\" key is missing 3 small flakes, on the left part of the key, other than that, i\u0027ve got no problems with it, instead of sliding your fingers around on it, (as I do with my right thumb - it\u0027s near the \"N\" key), you should learn to type while pressing down firmly on each key, it will increase the longevity of it.Oh, one final note that I should mention about the ruggidity of the PCG-K33, I had a bag or plate of something hot, I forget what it was now, but I had set it on the keyboard to do something or other, when I came back, I realized that it had warped one of the arrow keys, and the ctrl key.","But actually sony has repositioned it in the market as B Series, targeting business laptop market.The Z1 is incredible in terms of looks - the metallic finish, the tappered down front, the latch less screen and the black keyboard all spell beauty.I really like the brightness in this screen.","This mac really combines all of the great features and capabilities you would expect from a powermac into a great little package.I love the display, the ease of setup, the keyboard, ...I thought the gloss display would bug me, but I love it.Not sure I will want to go back to my desktop now that I have the freedom of wireless!On thing I will note: The white plastic is like static cling.","Also the keybaords have flimsy keys which have very often broken off,save for the fact that I have a few on the junkpile to pick from, a new keybaord is $95 from which you must carefully pick off the bad keys and replace your keyboard.","It is extremely fast, and that is not an overstatement in any way.I also love the build quality, iSight camera, lit keyboard and the \"wide\" trackpad, which perfectly matches the wide screen.","Everything about this system is stunning -- the screen, keyboard, design, and power.","ii) The keyboard has a terrible feel to it.","The keyboard, while I am probably the world\u0027s worst typist, also \"feels\" great when you use it.","I heard complaints about the keyboard and realize that those people are just whiners, or maybe i am just blessed with small fingers.","It\u0027s great for the TYPICAL user...but don\u0027t buy this laptop and then complain that you can\u0027t run your huge graphic-demanding games on it without giving up some quality...if you\u0027re in that boat, you should go with an Alienware.Some annoyances that have been listed with this laptop, other than battery life which I have already covered, are the keyboard and some complaints of overheating or loud fan noise.","somes times a week without it, or maybe 3 in a day, i also encounter the blue screen of death a lot...(the microsoft crash) which SHOULD be very rare on an XP machine.the keyboard layout is nice, when you get it it takes alittle time to get used to, but i type just as fast on this as a normal keyboard.there are 2 usb ports, they are on the right side of the laptop so it makes using a mouse very akward.This laptop is SO powerful and small, so its only natural that it would get hot, and when it gets hot the fan goes on...overall its average... but for the price i\u0027d go withsomething else I have used this machine for a month now and am fairly satisfied with the overall performance.","(There aren\u0027t that many games for Mac)In conclusion \u003d Jameson ThottamThe iBook G4 is a good value-for-money machine, great for those who just need to surf the net or for productivity purposes on the go.Jameson Thottam January 13, 2004This machine has a great screen, very confortable keyboard, lots of memory and a fast processor.It is kind of heavy so I would not recommed it to frequent travellers.I have two concerns:1.","I replaced that keyboard with a new one and the part was VERY easy to find online (through a Toshiba certified retailer).","Oh My God!

The heat vent is on the left side of the laptop, which is GREAT for all the right-handers out there that use an external mouse.","At least this time, they figured out the mouse pad.","I have some difficulty with the mouse area, but that can be resolved with the purchase of a wireless unit.","So, you spend about $1,200 on a computer and then shell out another $200 to keep it running for two more years??? I have decided to take care of the issue by using a bluetooth mouse but I do notice that the computer gets hot and the trackpad stops working; I shut it down and let it cool off and things are fine again.","The cooling fans are: One on the right side (right where you\u0027d have your trackball/mouse, and two on the bottom of the machine.","This means that Sony\u0027s hardware is top notch, at the very least you can bet it won\u0027t begin to crawl after a year of solid (ab)use.The only reason I take off one star from this review is the missing track-point ball from this laptop, but some people like the touchpad for the mouse, and if you are one of these latter, this is a 5 out of 5 machine!Don\u0027t listen to foolish naysayers.","Everything is great and works as good as it looks--elegantly crafted pearl white in appearance which resembles the Mac ibook; extremely light (2.8 lb) \u0026 thin (0.9\"); the package also includes a wireless optical mouse, external optical drive and a hip-looking soft vinyl carrying case.With the anticipation of the original spec won\u0027t meet my performance needs (i.e. a lot of Photoshop works and possibly direct manipulation of my D1X camera through the firewire connection), I have it customized in the dealer with an upgrade in CPU to 1.8G Centrino (745 Dothan), RAM to 768Mb \u0026 a 60G HDD which made it ALMOST perfect on the go.","It\u0027s much easier to use when my husband steals my laptop mouse than the other one was.My favorite feature about this laptop has been the Memory Stick drive! I have both a Sony digital still camera and a Sony digital video camera, and when I want to load photos and mpegs onto my computer, I just pop the stick into the side of it: No cords, nothing! The fact that it\u0027s that convenient now motivates me to do it more often than I was before.If I had to find a drawback to this computer, I\u0027d say it\u0027s the fan.","In this aspect, I prefer the Dell\u0027s response but backlit LED feature is not available.The trackpad is nice and big enough for mouse activity but sometimes gets in the way of my typing and can mess up with my typing especially when I have to reach out to the G, H, V, B and M keys.*LCD:The LCD is nice and bright and self-adjusts its brightness when in a low-light environment.","The scrollpad thing on the touchpad mouse is very convenient.","This is my first notebook computer and I found myself reaching for a mouse out of habit.","I links up easily with my panasonic plasma tv...I use my bluetooth wireless apple keyboard and mouse from my easy chair.","Fortunately I\u0027ll always be using a mouse with the thing.My only other complaint is battery life seems a little shorter than advertised.","So many notebooks decide to make you plug your mouse right next to where a PC card is sticking out or in other illogical configurations.","If too confining, the single USB port can be finessed with a daisy chain or a USB hub - but how much junk do you lug around all the time, anyway?

amazon.","And the player itself plays whatever it feels like playing on any given day.The buttons on the mouse are beginning to stick, and since this is a laptop I can\u0027t fix this simple problem myself, I\u0027d have to take it to a bunch of geeks to tinker at it, all the while enjoying the stacks of p0rn I\u0027ve downloaded.The Big Beautiful screen already has some Big Black dead pixels,

Open multiple versions of the Web? Use on-line research with WORD? I know it has to be there but it doesn\u0027t mean it comes easy.So, if you love your MAC, swell.","Despite my message stating that I had already re-installed the mouse driver, technical support suggested that I (once again) re-install the mouse driver.","I was originally going to get separate speakers and a mouse for the laptop, but it\u0027s not really worth it.The great thing about this laptop is that it\u0027s small enough to take anywhere you need it, but it\u0027s powerful enough to use as a regular desktop.Update #2 - 1 Month Later:I thought I\u0027d give one last update.","If you use mouse and you are right handed, cable will make right side unusable.2.","I\u0027ve paired it with the airport extreme base and the wireless mouse.","That shows that they really pay attention to the little things too.I bought a TDK Bluetooth PC card for $15 and got a Bluetooth mouse up and running instantly.","Another cool function: if you don\u0027t want to use the mousepad and would rather use a mouse, you can press a little button right above the mousepad that \"locks\" it, so that while you\u0027re typing, you don\u0027t accidentally move the mouse.","Then, in a fit of insanity, I clicked \u0026quot;buy\u0026quot; and now I am a very happy owner of the 17\u0026quot; 1.5GHz.Positives:- The screen is just massive, and you don\u0027t need to be a graphic artist or movie producer to use it; it works great for Excel, side-by-side document editing, or just keeping iChat and Sticky Notes in view while surfing the web- It\u0027s pretty fast; I\u0027m finally happy with the performance of Virtual PC 6.0 running Windows 2000 and Outlook XP; as a matter of fact I\u0027ve duplicated my Windows work laptop in VPC and no longer have to carry two machines around- Movies are incredible on the big screen, and the speakers have great stereo separation (to the point that sometimes working late at night, I think I hear someone in the room, and it turns out to be part of the song)- It\u0027s quite thin, even compared to the 12\u0026quot;, which is good on my wrists when typingNegatives:- Trying to get around the massive screen with the touchpad is a chore; get an external mouse ASAP- Sitting in bed working on e-mail can be a bit difficult, because if you end up slanting the PowerBook upwards, the cover wants to close- Even though this is one of the smallest 17\u0026quot; laptops out there, you just can\u0027t get away from the fact that it\u0027s a big monster of a machine when you spread out on a desk, airplane tray table, or other area I bought a product that is almost the same as this one (U205-S5058 instead of U205-S5057) at another store ($1200 before tax; the same specs except Vista Business), and I have been using it for about three weeks now.","Desktops consist of the keyboard, the monitor itself, the mouse, and other accessories.","I bought the docking station, which came with a wireless keyboard and mouse.","Three handy USB ports on the right hand side make connecting peripherals a snap, although they are placed close together.This machine has the nicest touchpad I have ever come across - a beautiful light feel and tap-and-drag with locking drags means that you never ever have to use the left mouse button! It\u0027s a synaptics model, so up there in quality with the best.The machine does get a little hot, so you will need to put it on a magazine if you have it on your lap a lot - I got a Targus lap desk from CompUSA.","An Apple USB External Modem is required to connect to the internet if you have dial-up internet service.Apple MA034Z/A External V.2 ModemI purchased a bluetooth wireless optical mouse that easily sets up and wirelessly connects with this computer.Logitech V270 Cordless Optical Notebook Mouse for Bluetooth - Mouse - optical - wireless - Bluetooth - bright silver.","I have this computer and I love it in just about every way.I use an external mouse instead of the touchpad, as I\u0027ve found the touchpad to be sensitive.","Printer+Tablet+Mouse takes up a lot of space on the right side of the laptop.","I wanted to buy a Vista laptop, so I tried a number of diffKensington 72414 PilotMouse Bluetooth Mini Mouse (PC/Mac)First, there\u0027s design.","Oh, my laptop came with a free HP mobile mouse (smaller mouse than normal for portability) and I love using it when I\u0027m stationed.","It\u0027s fast and my enjoyment of working on it greatly increased after I purchased a Mighty Mouse to go with it.","As I have an external mouse hooked to it....","I have an external mouse, but I find the touchpad far more convenient.","(I don\u0027t like her dell either) Speed and feel and look she says.Also this laptop that i had for 5 months already i have loved it ever since- BUt one Day while Cleaning the SCreen WITH A SOLUTION OF ALCHOHOL AND WATER -MY HAND SLIPPED!!!!!!!!1 RIGHT OVER THE LAPTOP AND AND KABOOM THEIRS GOES ABOUT A CUP OF WATER ALL OVER THE KEYBOARD AND MOUSE PAD!!! oH NO I THOUGHT BUT DIDN\u0027T THINK TO TURN IT OFF RIGHT AWAY. a PAGE POPPED UP THAT SAID HARDWARE CHANGE! aND I COULD\u0027NT TURN IT OFF.","This system rocks, it\u0027s easy to use and stable.The goodies offered are great and at a fantastic value.The battery life is awesome, yet the disk space could be bigger.2 USB ports, 1 FireWire 400, 1 DVI video (strange format) seem to be enough considering that you have bluetooth for new-generation mouses, printers and extra keyboards.Office\u0027s Excel in spanish has proved to be quite annoying.","I thanked Microsoft for a wasted half an hour to figure it out and then run \u0027chkdsk /F\u0027 to fix the drive and partitioned it immediately after that.The DVD/CDRW combo works fine, same for the Network and the PS/2 port with the classic Y-cable to accomodate both an external mouse and a keyboard.","I love the wireless keyboard and mouse as well as the wifi.","The edges are a bit sharp and I\u0027m getting used to the less precise feel of the track (mouse) button.","I recommend that you buy a mouse and program it to work with right click- If you are subscribed to NetFlix you CAN\u0027T yet (March 2008) watch movies on your Mac (has to do with Apple\u0027s Digital Rights Management software)- Although there is a Mac version of Microsoft\u0027s Messenger, it does NOT support video.","I feel like this lock will crack sooner or later if you use USB port all the time (well, you can\u0027t avoid this if you use mouse).","I\u0027ve also been trying to experiment with other people\u0027s Wi-Fi networks, this computer seems to be fully compatable for anyone looking to do that sort of thing.I bought an external mouse and keyboard, but the keyboard on the zx5280us is pretty nice (large enough to be comfortable); I just don\u0027t care for the traditional laptop mouse.The screen looks nice, it runs at 1280x800 with 32 bits.","Bluetooth works great with mouse and my PDA.","The mouse has an extra four way navigation key for using with the touch pad to scroll screens.","In less than 3 years I have had to buy a wireless mouse because the pad doesn\u0027t work.","If you buy an external keyboard/mouse you will be SET!The only thing that could make it better is 2 CB of RAM...but that isnt needed unless you are openeing up lots of files, programs, etc.","Still when I need to use my external Logitech mouse and my thumb drive I feel less ambivalent so it is worth noting this lack of vision from Dell engineers.","I don\u0027t like having wires for my usb mouse, speakers, lan, and ac adaptor going out all sides of the computer.","I have this feature on my mouse and am addicted to it.","You CAN turn off the mouse pad....","I use a third party bluetooth mouse with it, install went flawlessly, and it works like a champ.","I\u0027m very impressed that I haven\u0027t burned my legs when I have it on my lap, as I have done many times with my Dell laptop!I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, the keyboard is a little awkward to use, and those with small hands might want to shift the primary mouse button to the right.","I\u0027m now using a mouse whenever possible.","Now I have to pop in a portable USB mouse!As I said, this is my second Gateway laptop.","I recommend using the AC adapter and plugging it in most of the time.- This comment isn\u0027t specific to this computer, but after two desktops I\u0027m still getting used to the pointer and not having an actual mouse.","Also you would think only one mouse button would be strange but you adapt quick.","The need of a port replicator is very high as I plug into 3 printers, a flat screen, keyboard, mouse, etc.I ordered the \"Sony VAIO Port Replicator for FS Series (VGP-PRFS1)\" from Sony and waited 2 week for its arrival.","Definitely invest in the wireless Mac mouse for serious work, it works well.- Irritating sharp beveled edge on front of the case where your wrists rest.","also now using a mouse, which allows right click function.","Although the touchpad and its software work well, I\u0027m too used to using a mouse and also bought a USB mouse.","Battery life is average I recently bought an apple powerbook laptop 12\",that was listed as used but in very good condition.I was concerned about making a purchase like this from an unknown seller that seemed to be new to the site-but I trusted the Amazon site.The price was really good and the description impressive;so although I knew very little about the item I decided to risk it.I had been using a dell for about 4 or 5 years;the last 2 or 3 of which were computer hell.And I had been vowing to next time get a mac since I heard they were less aggravating in regards to things like freezing up for no reason,bogus error messages that I couldn\u0027t possibly understand,e-mail that wouldn\u0027t open for 5 minutes \u0026 then didn\u0027t like to receive or send mail some days,15minute boot-ups,and web pages(when I finally got on) that got stuck when I tried to scroll.Well, needless to say I am ecstatic! Everything actually does what you tell it to and almost instantaneously.I have made the adjustments without all that much hassle.Thought I might mind the smaller screen but not at all.Within the first week-I had done mail,gone on the internet,installed my mouse,the font I wanted,had it reading stuff for me,installed games,have it tell me the time etc etc etc.It is that user friendly.There is just too much to love about it to even list.I would NEVER go back to any other pc again!I am in computer heaven!

Just love the MacBook.","I also got the Apple Mighty Mouse and it makes XP a LOT nicer than trying to work with a single button mouse.","It was well packed, and the box and computer both contained a number of special items,e.g.,a handsome Dell carrying case,a double PC card slot with a modem card installed, an old fashioned mouse giving me a choice between the traditional notebook \"mouse\" and the mouse I am used to.","A very handy feature for disabling the mouse pad when using an external mouse.","I just got a usb mouse and now everything is fine.","So I\u0027ve purchased a full-sized cordless mouse, and solved that particular problem.","The screen is sharp and impressive, the battery life is good (not quite the 6 hours advertised, but a solid 4-4.5 hours), its incredibly portable, the full-size keyboard is easy to use, and I\u0027ve easily integrated the iBook at home for the full desktop experience with a regular monitor, wireless mouse, and external drive (to make up for the small hard drive).Having to buy Microsoft Office was definitely a negative of the iBook, but it was definitely worth the extra cost.","Alternately, you can choose to drive your external display exclusively at high resolutions like 1600x1200 or 1920x1440.Note: on this machine there are 3 USB ports, but no PS/2 ports for an external keyboard or mouse.","Another thing is the mouse pad is at a bad location because when I type, my hand goes across the mouse which jiggles the curser around.","I keep my mouse to the right of the screen (out of the way of typing)...but now important buttons like close/minimize are on the left, increasing mouse travel time.","This was an issue for me because I have a Bluetooth enabled phone and mouse, so I ordered direct from Apple.The 1 GHz processor and maximum RAM provide lightening fast boot-up and application loading.","I do miss the scroll button on my mouse, though I can live without that.","i use it with a mouse cause im not very fan of touchpad pointing device.","Dont count on buying a bluetooth mouse either.You are bound the hit the touch pad while typing and you might endup typing else where.","My bluetooth mouse was found with no trouble.I need to get use to the ports all being on the left side and the CD on the right compared to the MacBook Pro.","Futhermore I noticed that when I connect a mouse the system freezes occasionally for a second completely (the sound as well as display).If you research well you will get this one for *well* below $... with mail in rebates and other discounts.Overall a decent machine for the price.Pros:1.","Also the mouse on the computer is horrible - have a Thinkpad from work and the mouse is 100x better.","And it\u0027s remarkably light.My only complaints: The touchpad is dinky - you really need an external mouse for serious visio action - and it\u0027s just a LITTLE thicker than I wish...In the end - if size and coolness are primary drivers for you (as they are for me), this is a no-brainer.","I managed to avoid some of the software problems others have by uninstalling one of the hotfixes of XP and upgrading the mouse drivers.","I bought a USB mouse, and have two more ports that I can use.5.I like that the CD has DVD and RW capabilities.6.I like the design.","Vista seems to be compatible with all of my old programs so far...even the old game Forsaken that I had problems with on XP runs fine on Vista.Cons -The bloatware was rediculous, but once I got all of that off I was satisfied.It could use faster hard drives and at some point I\u0027ll probably replace them with 7200 rpm drives, but for now it is working fine for me.The HD DVD player software could use some work because the menu items only respond to the cursor keys and not the mouse so you can\u0027t sit back with your wireless mouse and make menu selections.The shiny cover is very impressive, but you better keep a cloth handy to wipe the fingerprints.","The extended area down from the keyboard, next to the mouse is more ergonomic and you wrists don\u0027t sag (anyone who has used a smaller lap top know\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about).","Fortunately, it\u0027s not nearly as hot as my crappy Vaio.- There are only 2 USB ports, so I have to do some plugging/unplugging between my printer, scanner, and mouse.","You can easily use your MacBook Pro on the road, but plug it into a keyboard, mouse, and huge display, when at your desk.","The touch pad also seems a bit more sensitive (my mouse will often pop around on the screen when another finger might accidentally touch it while scrolling).The only other downsides so far? Only one Firewire port (400).","It still fits into my backpack-style laptop bag easily, and the size and weight aren\u0027t a problem in the least for my needs.The processor on this thing is a screamer! I\u0027ve never had a computer boot up and shut down as fast as this one in my life! And for once I finally have a computer that can actually let me see the benefits of having Broadband Internet-my other 3 computers didn\u0027t let me see much improvement in speed.The keyboard is nicely laid out, with nice, clicky buttons.The touchpad is nice, because it\u0027s not as freakishly sensitive as my other one was; the HP, if you even brushed against it in the slightest, it would register as a mouse left-click.","That was a mistake, for the reasons that follow.Pros:- Was available off the shelf with reasonable specs- Uses mostly decent hardware- Integrated webcam- Quick setup out-of-the-box- Reasonably impressive specs (but comes with Vista, which undoes much of that value)Cons:- Keyboard is flaky (one of my keys died after a year, others have problems and are dying, and nearly half of them have popped off randomly at least once)- Mouse pad is flaky (often stops responding for a couple minutes)- WiFi card crashes a lot (will refuse to turn on; will turn on but not find any networks when I am right next to a router; will find networks with good signals and not connect; will connect but not send anything)- Hard drive is non-standard (can\u0027t replace it with non-Sony drives)- Hard drive is often very slow- Battery life is terrible (less than 1.5 hours at full power, less than 2 on power saver mode) - whoever said it got 4 hours was either lucky, wrong, or using an upgraded battery- CD/DVD drive is *loud*- Integrated speakers are terrible- Integrated microphone is terrible, even by laptop standards- Laptop gets *EXTREMELY* hot, even in standby.","This is the first wireless mouse I\u0027ve really liked.","Ditto for the mouse buttons.","The touch screen is no match for a mouse.","In any case, the functional wear of the button can\u0027t be helped, except by resorting to an external mouse more often.* The keyboard is not lit...","By the time I was through with a four-port USB hub, wireless mouse (which I found was unnecessary on trips, but great in the office), and the power cord (which you would think could be a lot smaller), it was less than the laptop, but I was still bringing a lot with me.","The price for the logic (limited mobility laptop) and the fact that after 2 months, I went ahead and ordered an IBM thats half the weight, 4x the battery life and doesnt create enough heat to cook my lap are why it doesnt get 5 stars.Pros: nice bright screen, latest XP media center Operating system, number pad, ports and card readers for just about everything, good speakers.Cons: It\u0027s a BEAST to carry around, heat, battery consumption, sketchy mouse, lack of bluetooth, price.","I\u0027ve bought a regular sized Logitech wireless media mouse to go with it which has worked out quite well (the volume control buttons on the mosue are very handy) and use a Kensington case that fits this notebook very well.","i would also suggest getting a USB mouse because the touchpad one isnt too great.","This machine ships with updated drivers, so it instantly recognized the mouse which meant I was off and clicking in no time.Unlike my old Dell laptop, this one allows me to turn off the touchpad when using a mouse, and that makes me very happy.","It does everything with grace.BTW, I reccomend the Appld bluetooth mouse and keyboard.","I suggest that anyone using this computer purchase a USB mouse to use with it because the pad is terrible.I do not suggest buying this unit as your first Apple computer.","I would advise a 3 year warranty to be safe, laptops have issues more often than desktops according to most! Also, grab a bluetooth mouse, and a cover/case on the way out and youll be all set!Enjoy the quality! Compaq 2701 does not work at the moment, because of some problems with Windows XP.","Empty promises after empty promises and they will even hang up on you- the audacity!

I purchased apple\u0027s \"mini DVI\" to DVI adapter, the apple bluetooth mouse and keyboard and use this laptop (with the clam shell closed) with my Viewsonic VA1912wb 19 inch monitor when I want more screen real estate (I didn\u0027t even have to install drivers for the bluetooth mouse, bluetooth keyboard, or monitor...the computer recognized those devices and they just worked.)","Delete unused fonts to make windows load faster.3-Get an optical mouse.","I loaded it and found that while I can watch movies hitting the play icon on the player, I cant use the mouse on any of the screen icons.","The touch pad (mouse) is also in a wide format, which is nice for bigger mitts like mine.","The T60 has problems adjusting screen resolutions, recognizing my mouse on the dock, and crashes with the blue screen of death.","On the one occasion I spoke with Toshiba to look for updates they were EXCELLENT!As a desktop I have connected a 17 inch Samsung LCD monitor and wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse along with a USB hub making it a simple matter of connecting or removing 2 plugs.All in all a great machine, my only complaint was( No Track Ball ); a left over issue from using and IBM but solved by carrying a optical mouse in my bag.","I did have to take my original computer back to the store because the mouse screen was loose.","You can manage the mouse, the typing and everything with your thumbs and believe me, it works, most people complaints about it\u0027s tiny keyboard because it\u0027s small for their fingers and bla bla bla... but it is not designed to be used like your everyday keyboard, it\u0027s designed to be used on the road, while walking, etc.","So I can lose the electrical outlet for 2 hours and 40 minutes.Easy Fix to Touch Pad, Jumping Cursor Issue!

Overall, Im enjoying this computer.","I find it marginally acceptable, but I would not spend my own money on such a system.Major misses:1) It comes with the synaptics touchpad, which defaults to accepting taps as mouse clicks (it should default to the \u0027suppress taps\u0027)2) Shutdown service takes too long, even for Windows 2000.3) No option to order with Linux or without Windows, even though Dell previously touted this feature.For everyday use, I still gravitate toward my iBook.","Pop out the keyboard, set-up the mouse and essential turn the rest of the laptop into a monitor.","I didn\u0027t like the original settings but once I changed it, I\u0027m not even considering getting a mouse.","The touch pad is so \"true\" and easy to use, that the mouse now stays in my briefcase unused.The \"not so good\" news: My machine came with a multimedia package that included a partitioned hard drive.","With a USB mouse, I could see using this as my only computer I got my vaio about a year back to replace an aging desktop.","Intermittingly the keyboard interface becomes hashed on some bootups - letters are numbers etc. unless I reboot \u0026amp; the mouse button became worn after a few months of left-clicking that I now use a USB Mouse \u0026amp; Keyboard.","Also, I find that using the touch pad isn\u0027t as convenient as using a mouse.","You will need a USB keyboard or mouse if you want to use an external one or get a USB-PS/2 adapter.","I would spend a few more bucks to buy the mouse as well.c) While the keyboard is a little dull, the touch screen is too sensitive.","Maybe it has to do with the Duron processor because the machine tends to get very hot sometimes (a lot hotter than my other Pentium-based laptops).Compaq lists only a couple of drivers \u0026 updates on their website (mouse and modem drivers).","Invest in external drives, sony memory stick, etc, etcexpensive product overall.-------The tricky part with this computer is that it\u0027 s so small, that mechanical parts are phone to fail quickly.Mine, the fan broke in just 1.5 years of owning.Then the mouse got stuck on lower- right corner and never worked again.","Plugged in a USB mouse and worked fine.","You take a bit of time (about 3 days) to get used to it, especially a ONE button mouse and the shortcuts with the keyboard, but it is very nice, very stable.","The Video/Audio play back, it pauses likes the mouse, not even a smooth play, everything plays smoothly on a $300 machine, but not on this $3k baby.","The scroll \"wheel\" feature on the trackpad is slow, and isn\u0027t supported by most of my softwhere - though my external mouse wheel works with everything.It\u0027s a good laptop, with money going to a good cause, but it\u0027s really not sturdy enough.","So far all the software needed to run my applications (McAfee Internet Security Suite, Lexar Media Card Reader, Palm OS, Wireless Optical Mouse, etc....)","It\u0027s not the \"prettiest\" laptop around but it has a VERY solid reliability ranking - right up there with IBM (which are much more expensive).Pros:- Big screen- Decent sound- Manual volume control !!! (really nice feature)- CD RW/DVD combo drive- Toshiba reliability- Price / valueCons:- Must be very careful with CD drive - could break easily cause it\u0027s the pop out type (keep small kids away).- Touchpad buttons a little flimsy (I use a mouse anyway)I\u0027ll mention it again - laptops break! So I wanted to get the most reliable brand.","When you tap on the tracking area, it takes that as a click on the mouse button.","But it will be a big deal after if you got a blue tooth mouse.","This is such a hassle when you use a mouse.- Placement of the headphone port on the mid-right side.","This makes this laptop a real pain to plug in to an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc on a regular basis and even when you do, you have a lot of unsightly cables shooting out from the sides.","I was supposed to get a free matching mouse, when I received the mouse it looked two years old.","I bought a wireless mouse (from Amazon -- works great) because I found the trackpad to be difficult, but Mac friends tell me that was true for them, too, at the first trials, and then they got used to it.","Acquired a Bluetooth MAC mouse which immediately worked, this saved me the need to use one of the 2 USB ports.","The screen is new the mouse button still clicks like it was new, keyboard is great condition, and it got here just on time.","It worked just fine, but with the Mac, there was no driver set up needed, just a 10 second \"pairing\" process and the blue tooth mouse was scampering across the table top.These are not \"assets\" advertized or promoted.","The Toshiba is handsome and speedy and the cPad, mouse pad is nifty and practical.","I prefer a mouse, but occasionaly use the TrackPoint.","When I called the technicians at Sony, they told me it is a typical problem on 505.I sent the notebook for touch-mouse replacement and took less than week to get it back.","I want to say there are at least a couple more movie formats that the Mac can\u0027t read- The right click feature on the mouse pad is not straightforward.","i would recommend upgradin to the better screen and also getting the 2gb ram if you are planning on doing a lot with it.cons- because i am picky... i think the touchpad + buttons suck but i use a mouse so whatever.","I don\u0027t use the WWAN part (nor am I going to pay Cingular $80/month--but maybe this will come down in price) but the Wifi works very well (as it should) and Bluetooth is great with this (get the Kensignton Bluetooth mouse--you will love it with this laptop)In terms of battery life, this part is maybe not a full five stars.","After my Gateway toasted itself, I needed to pick up a good, cheap computer to replace it, and the Aspire fit the bill: for what I paid for it at Walmart ($740), I was able to get a lot of features that you would only see on higher end machines- which I\u0027ll sum up with the obligatory pros and cons:Pros:-Dual AMD Turion64 processors-100 GB HDD-Gig of RAM-Looks nice-Integrated camera niftyness-Touchpad based navigation clicker is useful (little silver square between the mouse buttons)-It\u0027s really light- about a pound or two lighter than other notebooksCons:-New product line- might not have the support structure of Dell or HP-The 100 GB HDD is actually two 50 GB HDDs- while that\u0027s a neat feature- the computer cannot recognize them as the same drive: not sure if I like that or not yet*Update: After about 3 days I ran into an issue with the graphics card (software issue, not hardware), and had to get help from customer support: it turns out as I predicted that they have a pretty poor support structure.","Plug and play drivers don\u0027t work for simple accesories like a USB mouse !?!

I have tried to buy this product from EXPRESS SOLUTIONS twice, both times after a lengthy delay, they told me the product was unailable, however in the meantime my credit card had been charged.The credit card was refunded, however they caused much inconvenience, waiting for a product that in the end never showed up.They are a disgrace and should not be allowed to trade on AMAZON.","It has also gotten a companion External Hard Drive, An Upgrade to 2GBs of memory and a wireless keyboard and mouse.","Only the touchpad makes racket, but I\u0027m old school and a habitual mouse user anyway.I do most of my work in Word and otherwise am on the Internet.","Those people think of everything!

Typically, I hate touch sensor pads because I strain my hands on them as they don\u0027t always allow for the necessary fluency/dexterity of the hands/fingers when moving around...I prefer using a scroll mouse.","Just because you can\u0027t control a mouse properly, or fumble with buttons or can\u0027t configure your programs properly, that is YOUR fault, not Compaq\u0027s.","While the regular display of web pages may be too tiny for some (I can manage, but I don\u0027t need reading glasses), it has a zoom button right below the mouse-pointer.","Lasted around 2.5 hours.(normal life, I would presume)Screen is too bright at times (see review on crkt cty), and one needs to constantly move it to adjust to right view.Also, the DVD was a little sketchy when one moves the mouse over(as if there were scratches), and also, audio would be distorted if one attempted to open some other application.(For eg, I ran the WinXP tour)Other than these small grouses, it looks awesome, there\u0027s absolutely no noise from the fan at all.","The USB mouse did not work after patching the XP SP1.","It is time for the hippies at Apple to realize that the 80s are over.Wireless: Wow!

Decent screen, nice full size keyboard, touchpad is ok, but I got a wireless mouse.","Then they sell it as a refurbished, so no loss for them.I also bought a mouse and a bag with my ibook.","The keyboard is the most comfortable of all the laptops I\u0027ve used, although I did buy a wireless mouse which is a big help when going from a PC to a laptop.","The one thing i didn\u0027t like is this mouse, the buttons are very slender and flushed with the palm rest and doesn\u0027t have a textured surface, so with my medium sized hand, i find it a little difficult to use without looking at it and having my finder directly on it, otherwise, i would have to use more pressure than on any other laptops because my thumb is about twice the width of the button.Another thing that i would like to mention is that he power cord connection to the laptop seems very \"fragile\" it is thin and plugs into the left side, what makes is fragile is the fact that is plugs in perpendicular to the side so if you had this on your lap, and it happened to slip on the left side, i think there is a good chance that the plug would break.","I think also it needs to have 3 USB ports!! the two on board are kinda close some fatter USB devices will prohibit you from plugging in 2 items, my thumb drive is a little fatter so then I can\u0027t have my house plugged in, I will probably get a portable hub but my old windows laptop had 3 USB and they were located apart from each other and one was on the right side, which would be nice for some of the short corded laptop mouses for right handed people.","I am not a fan of touchpads, but the one on the Satellite works particularly well, allowing me to forgo my cordless mouse on a cramped airplane tray table.Neither the Celeron CPU nor the nVidia graphics on board this unit will be suitable for graphics-heavy work or games--it\u0027s a bit underpowered for these applications.If the Satellite only had a better battery, I\u0027d rate this a top-class road warrior.","Could you?Ok, I\u0027m not lying here: My left mouse button no longer sticks...it now no longer works at all!!!!!!!!!! I know you think I\u0027m lying, but I\u0027ve been sitting here clicking it like a madman and it does nothing.","Mouse pad sometimes behaves erratically.","I like this feature, but I wonder how useful it is, since I\u0027m usually sitting right in front of the computer and can just use a mouse, to access this content.PowerPC Applications on Intel MachineIf you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC.","The mouse is, in the other hand, very usable and you would become an expert on it in no time.","I was ready to just get a new router as the quickest solution, but it worked the next day without me doing anything, so I have no clue why.I did get a mouse for that right click action.","Macs apparently lack the right click shortcuts for the mouse, since there\u0027s only one mouse button, which I find less convenient.3.","The only good thing i can say about this laptop is that it looks good.They call it a amd turion 64 but it comes loaded with only 32 and you have to download the other 32 if you can find out where.The hard drive is configured for split fat 32 instead of ntfs.The resolution is 1680 x 1050 and that makes every thing super small and hard to read.I didnt think about resolution when i bought mine.I still cant figure out what this resolution is good for.Its not good for gaming or surfing the internet.The display screen is very dim set on the brightest setting.The bluetooth mouse seems to work only when it feels like it.The sound is terrible and has static.I bought mine sight unseen and am very disapointed with it.It has a very high price for such a low performing machine.","(You can still use a scroll mouse but its a pain).","somes times a week without it, or maybe 3 in a day, i also encounter the blue screen of death a lot...(the microsoft crash) which SHOULD be very rare on an XP machine.the keyboard layout is nice, when you get it it takes alittle time to get used to, but i type just as fast on this as a normal keyboard.there are 2 usb ports, they are on the right side of the laptop so it makes using a mouse very akward.This laptop is SO powerful and small, so its only natural that it would get hot, and when it gets hot the fan goes on...overall its average... but for the price i\u0027d go withsomething else I have used this machine for a month now and am fairly satisfied with the overall performance.","The touch screen and stylus took a little getting used to as compared to a mouse, but I find that after a while it was just as easy to use.","Plenty of cool stuff and used to be a good value for money at acquisition (march2006).Draw backs: Speakers are terrible (miss the Harman option) and processor overheats Notebook shell and mouse pad making it unpleaseant to use.Last, but not least, the screen started to generate an inch wide vertical line that soon after expanded into a second one and who knows where this will end (september2006).A shame warranty does not cover it!Tom Pluses, I got mine for the cheap, \u0026lt;$650 US, with a sale and the no tax holiday in NC.","You must create some space between the mouse and the notebook.","If you like using a mouse like I do, all these connections get in the way.","Also, invest in external USB DVD drive, keyboard, mouse and of course external monitor.It needs experienced computer user, not kid.The drivers alone for this machine for Win XP are about 140MBytes. over 30 individual drivers.","I\u0027m also not a fan of the new mouse pad page scroller.","The Blue Tooth mouse is jumpy and the Acer does not have a control panel to change the sensitivity.5.","The touchpad mouse was operating in reverse (up was down, down was up).","It was in a backpack with the superdrive, ethernet dongle, external hard drive, wireless mouse, etc. and they took the backpack.","I hate touch pads (and all T-series models, starting with T30, come with both TrackPoint *and* touch pad), I need three mouse buttons, serial port and both CD-ROM and floppy disk.","I found the best way to really align the pen is to use a USB mouse to click on the targets.","This is a superb machine, with a screen that is readily visible out of doors, good battery life (3+ hours), easy to use track-point and mouse buttons, and a brilliantly realized docking station.","The mouse\u0027s touchpad goes bad anywhere from 2 days to 3 months after you buy a laptop of this ZD series.","It\u0027s reliable and very resilient....it even fell off my bed and still functions perfectly.Also, the Bluetooth Mighty Mouse is a very worthwhile investment.","I used the k35 laptop for only 6 months now.. you know what i am upto :* my mouse buttons are bad* the battery life now stands only 30 mins. (sony says 1 hr min)* The power pin is broken* My DVD drive doesnot work at all.* I couldnot create a restore CD..","We both had to buy an external mouse as the trackpad is next to unusable, the cursor jumps when you\u0027re typing away, wireless card is unreliable.","Now if I payed the suggested retail of $999.00, I would be slightly disapointed.The screen is bright and sharp and great! The built in webcam rocks! The touchpad annoys the hell out of me, so I MUST purchase a wireless mouse before I go nuts, and the wifi signal sometimes is super slow or doesnt work at all.","Several months later, my mouse started flying erratically around the screen.","The touch pad is definatly better than the mouse, and I have noticed that I type faster with my laptop\u0027s keyboard rather than my desktops.","When I work at my desk and write documentation and presentations, I will prefer to have the Sony plugged into my 19\" monitor, USB keyboard, USB mouse and Ethernet.","The speed at which this machine handles 4 or 5 programs at once is nothing short of amazing! It\u0027s light, it runs for almost 3 hours on it\u0027s battery( with settings on the processor at low, and screen at 75% brightness and with a mouse being used in the USB port.), it runs cooler by 15 degrees than my 15\" PowerBook did on average doing the same work, its made like a work of art as all Apple products are.And one very important thing to remember about anything Apple is this; if at anytime during the waranty period you have problems you will experience top-notch customer service via AppleCare.","This is an awkward position - which means that my DSL wire crawls all over my table and my wireless mouse stick sticks out outwardly and I have to take care not to hit it when moving the mouse.","Weighing in around about 5.5 pounds, it slides into my school bag and works perfectly in my classes with the power to run all the documents and presentations I need, still play games and watch youtube and videos, and for a older machine, runs much faster than my room mates Compaq Presario that\u0027s only four months old that has experienced several crashes and thats with all the modern options and with Vista operating systems over my XP Pro.Some Pro\u0027s I\u0027ve noticed with the Latitude: Reliable performance, very nice clear display, excellent processing speed, comfortable design in the keyboard, parts for this puppy are cheap and easy to come by...Some irritating little cons that keep this from being a five star would include: The dual mouse design can be irritating, touch sensitivity in the touch pad can sometimes open and close windows at random...Otherwise I have a high level of satisfaction with the Dell Latitude C600 and were I to get into a pinch again and needed another computer for some odd reason, I wouldn\u0027t hesitate in purchasing another C600 to fill the need.","I have occasional problems with the included BlueTooth mouse, but only on startup while the BlueTooth is initializing.I\u0027m not a big fan of included software and mercifully this system doesn\u0027t include much.","I bought a Mighty Mouse to compensate fo this.","At home I hooked up a notebook USB mouse and turned off the touchpad.5.","You have to lift your hand if you have to use mouse.4.","I think I\u0027m going to pick up a wireless mouse soon for when I working from home.In all, this is a great computer, and has far exceeded my hopes.","I primarily use a mini-mouse through one of the USB ports which are conveniently located on either side of the machine--very convenient and allows me to configure the notebook to best fit whatever impromptu workspace presents itself.","I will not buy a laptop if it has a track ball or mouse pad.)","I\u0027m only on day two, so it might change, but I\u0027d say for the price, I\u0027m in love with my new gateway! A mouse button broke on this machine after only a couple months of extremely light use.","Set up the WiFi in a place where signal is known strong otherwise you will go nuts trying to juggle the mystery messages in the setup screens.- the mouse thingy at the left is virtually unusable.","Even that old laptop has built-in infrared port! SHAME ON ACER!!!I\u0027m wondering what Acer is going to do when build their next budget notebook model, hmm cut off built-in touch pad mouse?!OVERALL CONCLUSION: I would say it is an extremely budget laptop with a good processor (which is in the mid of Pentium M class) but not much too offer in features.","i use my notebook-sized mouse and hate running my palm across the touchpad....- \"100 gig\" HD actually showing 89 gigs of space to use (there is a hidden partition, but windows says its only 6 gigs, where\u0027s the other 5?)Otherwise the Dual-Core CPU\u0027s book along and it runs all my programming stuff just fine :-) Definitely recommend this laptop to anyone looking for small and fast I hope the person who cheated me got in big trouble for this.","The only way to avoid the problem is to reboot with the mouse unplugged and then plug it back in afterwards.My final complaint is that the computer will ONLY work with its inherent screen resolution.","In fact, I describe this machine as the single best-suited computer to my way of working that I have ever had - desktop or laptop! That includes all the big names and even some custom built stuff - and I was a die-hard ThinkPad devotee for years!Don\u0027t expect battery life - between the very fast processor and the super-bright display, it can devour a battery in WELL under an hour when you\u0027re actually using the system.I\u0027ve upgraded to 1GB RAM recently, and it helps alot in intensive tasks like video rending and audio processing.The primary \"mouse\" button on the touchpad has recently started feeling funny, and it\u0027s mis-aligned now - I think something has broken in there.","I found thee mouse touch pad to work very well and smooth, unlike alot of touchpads this one does not skip around.","If you\u0027re a right-handed person and have an audio cable attached, it interferes with the mouse.","The heat extractor outlet is situated on the right hand side of the unit so that if you use an external mouse it becomes unbearably uncomfortable after about 5 -10 minutes.","I just hooked up my optical mouse, problem solved.","How about $60 for a mouse?4.","Let someone else offer the wanted 2-button mouse/trackpad with scrolling capabilities.","The problem is obvious on mine, I have a good eyesight - and depend on my PowerBook for graphical work, and earn a living... so scrolling diagonal lines on light grey backgrounds behind text, scanline texture surimposed to any graphic, is not an option for me and is giving me headaches literally as well as figuratively (pun intended) and I sincerely don\u0027t know what to do as refund, resale, switching to a 17\" is not exactly what I want to do if it is even an option with Apple for me at this point.And contrarily to what some say no, I don\u0027t need to be two inches from the screen to see them, and I am looking at the monitor perpendicularly.Other than that, small problems with the USB, it seems that I need to unplug and plug my external mouse for it to be recognised when the computer wakes up from sleep.","Unfortunately, I completed all of this installation and customization using an exterior USB mouse.When I took the Vaio on my first business trip after its purchase, I noticed a peculiar phenomenon - the mouse pad motion was backwards! I.e.","The mouse pad can be sticky due to perspiration.The original bad news....Initially had intermittent web-cam and external USB devices along with loss of audio and changing of display settings and freezing of video playback and system lockup.","Which is annoying because it places it on a hidden partition swallowing up 13Gb of storage (of your 60Gb).The touch settings in Vista are pretty bad by default, so you really need to tweak those a lot to get them right (turn off the silly mouse \"help\" pointer, enable the keyboard instead of handwriting recognition etc...).After that you need to do something mean to it; rip it open and swap out the 1Gb module for a 2Gb one.","While the location is a bit weird, it\u0027s great having them for flash cards, scanner, a mouse, etc.The PC can also support great monitor resolution... another perk if you\u0027re using it in an Office setting with a larger monitor.Another downside is the fact it lacks a normal Printer cable connection.","\u0026lt;\u003d v.bad quality hinge.-HDD spins at only 4200rpm-Battery life is just like my old 15.4\u0027\u0027 hp centrino with around 2 hours of battery, max.3 hours with wifi off and screem dim. dont see how the new santa rosa has improved the battery life in any way.-speaks produce very good sound, but even at max volume theyre very very very very quiet.-Camera doesnt want to start up sometimes and you must restart the laptop or it wont start.-keyboard isnt as comfertable as my old hp-touchpad keys are very hard and very loud-only 3 usb ports, should have 4.If you compare specs with price i would defenitly give it 5 stars, but because of all the cons im giving it four.Still this is an amazing machine, with many many pros, non of the cons are anything serious really, highly recommended.EDIT: alright so after using the machine more, here are some updates;-Battery life lasts for under 1.5 hours under high performace mode and around 2-2.25 hours until power saving mode.-If you wanna play a game, changing your settings to high performace not only does it affect the brighteness of screen ect, but it increases fps.-The keyboard isnt as bad as i fist thought also the mouse it still annoyingly loud.overall again i must say, great product.","I am rarely somewhere that I don\u0027t have an outlet, funny how most hospitals need electricity, so I carry the power cord, I wish they made a more portable version, and my travel mouse, I hate touch pads.","It is fast, well-constructed and lightweight with a beautiful, clear screen, all of which are essentials for my computer happiness! The touchpad is awesome...I find myself wishing that my iMac mouse had a similar feature.","The thumb-stick functions as a mouse, ethernet works, I have heard wireless works, and the touchscreen worked somewhat for me.","The feature I like best is that there is a vertical scroll area on the right, which lets you scroll your screen up and down, like the scroll wheel on a conventional mouse.","If you want to use a mouse and/or a keyboard, it uses USB only.","Using an external mouse doesn\u0027t helps at all.","I use the wireless keyboard and mouse that came with the base most of the time.","In two hours I had transferred all my files.I also bought a Bluetooth mouse and it worked beautifully.","The external VGA (video) connector comes out of the left side (sort of like the Thinkpad X series) and that can be difficult if you\u0027re putting your mouse over there.","Personally I use my middle finger for moving the mouse, adding my ring finger to scroll up and down, and to right-click, with my index finger wherever I want it on the button.","This has got its own mind and you are best advised to get a wireless mouse to avoid frustration.","I\u0027m a congenital heart surgeon.This computer is a precision instrument.It will improve your computing performance.I\u0027ve encountered a single problem - fairly frequent failure of the wireless mouse, requires a reboot to restore, otherwise would have been five stars.I\u0027m very satisfied with my purchase.","Be prepared to buy a USB mouse (less than $... on Amazon.com for an optical logitec mouse) since the touch pad pointing system, as is the case of other laptop units, is an awkward way to control the system.","Take it on vacation, take it to work, take it to Gramma\u0027s.Get one! I\u0027ve had this little wonder for 8 months now and will never go for one of those big, heavy 4 pound (or more) so called \"portable PCs\"...When I travel with this Vaio I agree with the common complaint about the keyboard and I solved it simply by buying a silicon keyboard (one that can be rolled up into nothing...) and use the stylus as a mouse.","You need to buy USB mouse and keyboard to install windows in MacBook.","I use my computer on a lapdesk with a mouse, and the position of this port makes that impossible while I have something plugged into it.","Plus I set the middle mouse button to \"stick Scrolling\".","I found the buttons on the mouse pad thing awkwardly small.","But, this laptop is so big you probably with be using a mouse anyway.","lots of people complain about the mouse cursor jumping around when typing, here\u0027s how to fix that: when you type, to disable the touch pad, press the FN button (located on your keyboard, next to the CTRL button), hold and press the F9 button, located on top of the row of number button.","I wish the left/right mouse keys were slightly less stiff, and I must say that although the keyboard is nice (less force needed than on HPs and Compaqs), I am dissappointed that Gateway left a chasm below the j, k, and l keys.","The mouse is dead, the screen is on but, you know the system isnt working.It seems to do this randomly..","It supports the \u0027two-finger clicks\u0027 to simulate a two-button mouse and to implement scrolling, but I havn\u0027t much used it, opting for a small two-button mouse instead (purchased separately, and not from Apple).There are some other things that come with the MacBook, most notably the built-in iSight (which can\u0027t be physically disabled short of voiding your warranty), and a tiny remote.","Better than what I have had in the past.USB ports - There are three side by side and I noticed that when I connect a USB device (mouse) and a Lexar Flash Memory I am not able to use the 3rd, since it does not fit.DVD - I can not say they are all like this but the DVD drive was a bit loud.Overall, I can give this laptop 3.5 - 4 stars.","The TrackPoint is a little... odd to me, ut i have a wired IBM mouse i usually use with it.","There in only one button mouse.","I do digital photography, and I can just pop my Secure Digital Cards right into the provided memory card slot and the photos \"Pop\" onto my bright, clear screen with a couple of mouse clicks.Also, I do a bit of video editting and assorted 3D graphics editting on the machine as well, and the laptop races through tasks as well as my AMD 64 bit 3400+ machine.","Also, the mouse button wasn\u0027t very sensetive.","In addition, Bluetooth built-in allowed me to use a very nice wireless mouse with it.","Still, it has few new navigation tools, but nothing like the Windows Start button or right mouse click capability.With an Airport Card installed ((...) extra), the much hyped wireless capability is supposed to be compatible with the 802.11b standard (also known as known as Wi-Fi), but it only works with the pricey Apple Airport base station, not most other 802.11b networks.","The minor stuff is annoying; trial versions of everything from Sony software to Spiderman 1 and 2 (that you get to buy if you want to watch) that take a while to delete, a touchpad that occasionally floats your mouse around, and restore CDs that you have to make yourself.","They even asked me to check driver settings, after clearly being told it was a hardware problem!!! The mouse sometimes has a mind of its own.","This laptop is easy to use, and I love the mouse.","One thing I do not like about the keyboard is due to the fact the keyboard does have all the keys of a standard keyboard, the right shift key is TINY!! I am used to using a bigger shift key so when I attempt to type capital letters, I frequently end up typing \u0027/\u0027 instead.The mouse pad is also off center due to the bigger keyboard and that threw me off for a while, but now I\u0027m used to it.One thing I do not like about the laptop appearance is the glossy back.","I really wish the laptop scrollpad had two buttons instead of one; I typically use a BT500 Bluetooth mouse (which works perfectly with the Powerbook\u0027s built-in Bluetooth) to overcome this limitation.","The Trackpoint device, patented by IBM, is the best on-keyboard mouse device yet devised.Minor quibble: the speakers are placed right where the user\u0027s wrists will rest.","With one click of the mouse, you go from a very fast Mac notebook to a very fast Windows notebook, and everything works as one expects from Apple.","I carry this to school without a problem, but if you\u0027re looking for something ultra-lightweight for frequent travel, you may want a smaller laptop.The only complaints I have are.....the touchpad has a very sticky surface, so if you don\u0027t plan to use a mouse, you may want to try this one out in the store before purchasing.","Go to the mouse properties and turn off the options to \"Use Web Assistant\" and \"Use Scroll Function\".","The 3 USB ports will be sufficient for my mouse, keyboard, and external hard drive, and the computer itself is fast and reliable.As far as Vista vs XP goes: I haven\u0027t had any compatibility issues yet, though I\u0027m certain they\u0027ll come up at some point.All told, though, the widescreen display, 2gb standard RAM, and impressive hard drive all combine to make what is, to me, a very powerful and effective system, the only downside of which is its size, which is also a plus (screen size).","Although, I do load most of the music onto my computer instead of playing it direct from the cd because the disk drive is very noisy.The mouse pad does tend to get hit durring word processing, therefore the cursor can end up in weird places, but you can avoid this problem by pushing the cursor/arrow off to the side of the screen while typing.I\u0027ve had this computer for 4 years now; it was a gift upon graduation from high school and I\u0027ve used it a whole lot during college.","Quiet, doesn\u0027t heat up too much.If you\u0027re a vi user, you probably won\u0027t like the position of the Escape key (you can remap it to F1).It took about three years for the battery to become unusable (I recently got a new one for about[...]).The built-in wireless antenna stopped working and I got a new one from Lenovo support (for free, it was still under the 3-year warranty), but the old one fixed itself as soon as the replacement arrived and has been working now for a few years since.The left 25% of the space bar don\u0027t produce a space when pressed --- started happening after around three years.The left button on the lower mouse controls stopped working --- started happening after four years.I\u0027ve been using a Macbook Pro for work, and every time I open the T41 now, it\u0027s such a relief to be able to tilt the screen as far back as I want.","I love Macs! The only drawback on this computer is the mouse pad is not a smartpad.","I\u0027ve tried half a dozen different mouses, all with the same result.","The mouse is a bit \"sticky\" so I use a USB mouse.","Another huge improvement is that the fan exhaust is now facing back instead of to the right so my mouse hand is not overheated while using the system.As with most laptops these days there are not serial or parallel ports, in this case even with the port replicator you are out of luck if you have a parallel printer.","The Adaptec USB 2.0 2-PORT 1420V Kit Prand can now connect a USB hub and from there a mouse, a keyboard and an external sound card; it\u0027s still unreliable as from time to time the mouse and keyboard start stuttering, so I\u0027m stuck with a crippled computer.","I have a few other minor gripes about this notebook: there is no PS/2 port to connect a traditional keyboard/mouse and the wireless adapter is only 802.11b (instead of the faster and backward compatible 802.11g).","How about $60 for a mouse?4.","If I preferred to use a mouse, I\u0027d buy this notebook.Also, the video picture made by its web cam pauses often.","Using a bluetooth mouse means keeping both USB ports free for other uses if necessary.","I was forced to purchase a wireless mouse to use since the touchpad doesn\u0027t function.","At 6 pounds, it isn\u0027t the lightest machine, but it is much lighter than the Pentium 4 laptop it replaced for me (a Compaq Presario 2500 at about 9 pounds).One negative: The silver paint finish on the screen cover rubbed off the very first time I put the machine in a laptop bag with a mouse.","One other note: Mac now supports right-click as well, so be sure to get a two button mouse to go with your new MacBook!! I reccomend the Microsoft wireless notebook mouse which has a very small and portable snap in reciever.","It\u0027s also very quiet.The only downside to this laptop is that it does get a bit warm, and the touchpad can get especially annoyingly warm, if you don\u0027t have a mouse.","However, my blue-tooth mouse that came with the Acer Ferrari 5000 still does not work under Vista.","This particular model had everything I needed, and some more to boot, and I knew I wasn\u0027t going to do much typing as I mostly use it for electronic circuit analysis which is 90% mouse use.","The one I bought has the T7500, but maybe the one described here, on 1/5/08, has the 7300...Another difference is that I don\u0027t see any free accessories listed with this one, whereas the one I bought included a gaming mouse \u0026 a backpack.Regardless, this is a great laptop; just be sure you know what you are \u0026 are not getting.One other thing: the ASUS website has all the updated drivers you may need or want, and the updated NVIDIA driver makes a noticeable difference! Four WONDERFUL Stars!! As a 19 year Mac user who goes all the way back to the Mac-II and even before System 7 OS, this newer model Intel 2 GHz Core 2 Duo processor-based MacBook is light-weight, slick-looking, wonderful portable computing.","Please check custumor image The company who sold me the Ibook sent it with the keys coming out, and the trackpad doesn\u0027t work; I have to use a mouse.","Easily fixed with a Microsoft wireless mouse and the touchpad turned off.The ability to scale up is pretty limited to the hard drive, and at 8O GB and a high spin rate, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be needing much more.The DVD-WR drive is a little noisy, but there is a system utilty that dampens the spin rate/noise when it cranks up.","The mighty mouse arrived today.","First, the downside - the mouse can be flakey.","I find I have no problems with the ergonomics of the keyboard or touchpad, though I do keep a tiny USB optical mouse in my case for hotel stays, etc.Overall, this is the ideal 2nd computer, especially for a student or for a frequent flyer.","It really doesn\u0027t matter to me though as I have a small backpack-like case that I carry it in, along with keyboard, mouse, AC adapter, extra batteries for all, dongle for wired Ethernet/monitor output/NTSC video out, headphones and even an AV cable for connecting to a TV.","The new two finger scroll pad, has totally changed my opinion on scroll pads, it enables me to scroll long web pages without pressing the mouse button.","I have a wireless mouse, a cooling fan, a printer, two chargers and several jump drives that all run on USB ports.","The mouse tracking area\u0027s default behavior is very counter-intuitive.","my M35 a ultility that turns down the brightness of the LCD based on the amount of battery left, but i think a program of such can be found on the internet, but i just want to mention that because it would help to conserve the battery.The mouse pad is an odd dimension, it is about 1.5\"H x 3\"W, which is a little short and wide compared to other laptops, it is made by synaptics, which makes touchpads for like 95% of the laptops out there.","I set the mouse driver to not wake the machine - problem gone away.","It matched the mouse! I cannot even find a backup battery except from Toshiba for ...","this problem has recently been fixed with some new vista updates- incompatibility with vista and itunes \u003d NO CD DRIVE; this problem is well documented online and as of now there is no solution; for a 1200 dollar computer, i think i deserve a cd drive!- frequent crashes ---i have seen the blue screen of death many times over the last year- the most urgent problem yet: MY LEFT MOUSE BUTTON DOESN\u0027T WORK ANYMORE! This is the most used part of the computer!- another very annoying thing---the BATTERY is completely USELESS now! i unplug the power and the computer goes from 100% -0% power in a total of 10 minutesthus, if u were to ask me, i would definitely NOT buy this computer again.","I added a MOGO mouse that stores and charges in the PC slot.","The lap top is very annoying without an optical mouse.","So far: 1) graphics card, battery, mouse key are allll broken just after warrenty expired.","In fact, I spent 3 hours writing yesterday evening and didn\u0027t notice any additional errors in my typing.I\u0027m not a fan of touchpads, though, so I added a USB Wireless mouse.","(Gaming mouse, headphones, etc etc) Buying a large laptop means you need large everything else too..","It still functions but does not give the response I need for it, so i just switched the left-right mouse controls.","I discoverd how well iMovie works with my Digital Camcorder and now I have plenty of time to practice using them together.The only significant problem I have is using a trackpad instead of a mouse but that\u0027s a laptop, not a macintosh, problem.","I\u0027m not impressed with ease of use nor accuracy and I end up plugging a cord mouse instead as the onboard one drove me nuts.","The airport extreme 802.11g is very fast and the bluetooth works well with the Apple wireless mouse.","First of all, the mouse plug is on the lower right hand side.","It is light, requires little space, does not need an external DVD, will simultaneously take a mouse and one additional USB device and, with the settings noted earlier, can be viewed easily enough.Comments or questions welcome.","One month later, the mouse touchpad has failed.","I purchased one a year ago and after very light usage to complement a desktop PC and about half a dozen road trips, the AC power connector is unreliable and the left button on the trackpad/mouse is almost unusable.The power connector -- the port on the laptop itself, not the adapter accessory -- intermittently fails if I move the computer at all, and it gets ever harder to remove the power plug from the port.","I don\u0027t remember hitting the head and moving the mouse when I typed the letters \u0026quot;h\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;g\u0026quot; (or whatever two keys it is between) so if you don\u0027t like it, it should never interfere with your work.The screen is great! Big enough to have your desktop arranged like you like and plenty big to watch DVDs.","There has been no problem for my keyboard or mouse, or anything for that matter, and ive had mine for about 4 months.","I also maxed out the RAM at 2 gigs, which has helped tremendously.I added a bluetooth keyboard and mouse (apple) and use my existing 20\" flatscreen, with the laptop\u0027s screen acting as a palette monitor while I am in the office.","I got roughly 4.5 hours from it, but got almost double that from the Lenovo, and about an hour more from Sony.-Small trackpad - Really small, to some not a problem - with 3 usb ports, you can find room for a mouse-No webcam - not a dealbreaker, just a good add-on Sony, and other competitors, haveBOTTOM LINE: GREAT for college students.","It\u0027s a pain in the neck trying to handed a computer (on your lap) with a network cable hanging off one side and a mouse and power plug hanging off the other side.- Display Resolution: Maximum resolution is 1280x800!!! It\u0027s a new computer with a decent video card and that\u0027s the highest resolution? If I would have known this, I would have probably got a different model.","Eudora and Internet Explorer will be missing .exes or files to run, and I\u0027ll have to reboot, and everything will be fine.Another trauma I\u0027ve had is with the mouse port.","The large screen means you really don\u0027t need to worry about hooking up the machine to a larger monitor even when you are working for long hours (though the resolution is an issue).While the detachable keyboard and wireless mouse may seem like a novelty, they are notable for one reason.","All usb ports on the left side - make sure to buy a mouse with long cable2.","This is the only one broken mouse I have ever used, which cost me more than 40$. also the bag is of really shabby quality.also as to the technnical support, if the component is out of order or broken, then you have to contact then.","I would suggest buying a mouse.","The two best are the microsoft notebook optical mouse and the Logitech V500 Cordless Notebook Mouse USB4-The belkin LCD cleaning kit which contains a 2 sided brush, 1 for dust and the other for applying the isopropyl alcohol solution to clean the screen.5-At least 1 gig of memory.6-Open office which is a freeware office utility sweet which is smaller then ms office and has most of the essential features.","Backlighting is nice but cuts off after a few seconds and you have to press a key to turn it back on - there is no option for leaving it on longer.The keyboard is the biggest thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars.If you use the sticky keys feature in Vista it makes the keyboards single shift key MUCH easier to deal with by letting you press shift and then the character without having to hold shift down.The mouse stick and buttons work wonderfully and the function buttons on the sides can all be reprogrammed to any function which is very helpful.","The screen is brilliantly clear and fantastic for HDTV viewing, and the built-in webcam and mike were pleasant surprises to behold as I did not read about them in the fine print!To accompany my Satellite A205-S4607, I got the Kensington Ci65m Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse K72267US and the American Chiropractic Assiociation\u0027s recommended Kensington Contour Cargo Notebook Case K62907US.","Not so much as to be uncomfortable, but enough to let your left hand know where the CPU is.Ports are reasonably plentiful, including serial, parallel, display, USB, modem/phone, ethernet, mouse, headphone, microphone, card slots, infrared, and a display-top connector for webcams and such.","Of course the 14\u0026quot; TFT screen only supports 1024x768, but I have it configured now to simultaneously drive an external monitor at a total of 2048x768! That\u0027s right, I have a horizontally spanning virtual display where I can mouse from my TFT to my 19\u0026quot; analog monitor.","I use it for writing papers.I use it for everything I do.Of course, this product has been replaced by a newer line,but the mathematicians who were inspired by my use of this tablet,to buy the newer ones, say that they are happy that they got one.Notes:1) Took time to get used to the mouse in the middle of keyboard.2) I run Linux (Ubuntu) instead of the Windows junk that came with machine.3) Battery life is now at about 3 hours.4) Runs a little hot (in comparison to e.g. Macbook).","Bravo Compaq for this feature!Another good feature of the trackpad on this machine is that it has a dedicated scroll area which apparantly emulates a wheel mouse\u0027s wheel.","I\u0027m not using a wireless mouse since the mouse batteries could die while I\u0027m working.Be sure click the \u0027lock\u0027 switch after you attach the laptop battery to get some peace of mind.","They did tell me, though, that the drifting mouse sometimes happens in tablet mode and called it a \"limitation of the product.\"","There is something so incredible about sitting on my bed with the wireless mouse, internet and printing and NO CORDS! Having a USB printer plugged into the base station is great.","I was originally going to get separate speakers and a mouse for the laptop, but it\u0027s not really worth it.The great thing about this laptop is that it\u0027s small enough to take anywhere you need it, but it\u0027s powerful enough to use as a regular desktop.Update #2 - 1 Month Later:I thought I\u0027d give one last update.","External USB mouse is a must...any good old USB mouse will do, nothing fancy needed.","I only use my HP with a different mouse in the USB port.It has shut down once or twice for no reason, and sometimes won\u0027t start without pressing the \u0026quot;reset\u0026quot; button, but otherwise it\u0027s been smooth riding with the system itself.","Touch screen is kinda glitchy, mouse connected to usb port doesnt repsond sometimes.","It is a silver optical mouse with a USB cable that retracts into the mouse body for travel.","It is this notebook and also case and mouse, all pink, it is the cancer awareness special.","It is NOT the most expensive one I\u0027ve bought.-As with other notebooks, it became obvious I would need to make some supplemental purchases--mouse, software, carry case, etc.","This way the mouse pad is always just a mouse pad, no confusion.I\u0027m using the Vaio\u0027s built in 802.11n wireless with a new LinkSys router that supports 802.11n and the connection speed is great.","The fingerprint scanner is a real time-saver when logging into websites or using one-touch fast user switching and the Bluetooth capability enables me to use a wireless (Bluetooth) mouse without having to take up a USB port to do it (plus it should come in handy for syncing a PDA)! I was also impressed with the included remote control that lets you use your computer as a TV/Stereo/DVD player when using the Media Center.There are a few downsides to be aware of, however, when considering buying the AX570G.","I have found that I type and use a mouse much faster than I can work on-screen.I keep my computer at low memory usage and I never put non-mainstream software on it, plus I run a virus scanner, so I can only point to the computer itself as the source of my many, many problems with this product.","By default, the mouse pad is set to allow dragging along the top and dragging along the right side to do special functions.","All of that and it still weighs less, takes up less space and functions as well as any ultra portable I\u0027ve had.Usability:The mouse is ok once you get used to it, and the keyboard is really only for small entries and just one step better than an on screen keyboard.","I use mine for the card reader, the wireless mouse and all my flash memory devices.Some Pro\u0027s- Excellent strength in acheiving wireless signal- Very good keyboard reaction- Excellent Monitor (Screen) Display- Good battery charger (Takes about 1-1 1/2 hours to fully charge the batteries)Some Con\u0027s- Poor battery life - Less than 2 hours of continious operation (approximately)- Takes a little too long loading the software upon power-up- Suggest buying a Wireless Mouse- Consider purchasing 512 M ramAll in all a very good product from Toshiba, who have always been a great manufacturer of laptop computers.","I didn\u0027t enjoy a laptop trackpad before meeting this, with that nice two-finger scrolling feature, which brutally beats the scrolling wheel of my Bluetooth mouse and those clumsy trackpad scroll bars found on most laptop PCs.The keyboard is literally DELICIOUS to my touch, and that keyboard backlighting feaure is pure genius.","You may have to find some more specialized programs for Excel and Powerpoint files, Graphics editing, etc...-ummm.....-The mouse has just one button-umm.....-Mac OSX takes a little getting used to, but then you\u0027ll figure it out after a day or twoYou will be sorry if you choose to buy a Wintel (Dell, Compaq, HP, Gateway, Sony, etc...)notebook.","It\u0027s great to run a pc with the option of using the stylus pen or touchpad instead of a mouse.","The Samsung is listed for $89, but comes with a built in eraserhead mouse.","I called apple and went to the apple stores, everyone told me this is how the trackpads work for apple machines, even the desktops with mouses are like this( I thought my trackpad was broken ) They don\u0027t use the current mouse or redwood software, you have to find a free shareware named sidetrack, this will allow you to calibrate the tracpad to your liking and enable the side and vertical scrolling.","A bit annoying, but a problem that can be solved with an external USB mouse.","Also, they have these keys around the mouse for retriving your mail and for shopping--very easy to hit these key by accident--only if you use companies associated with them, well if you hit these keys your stuck and you can\u0027t get out of the set up form without setting up an account and it is a major problem, if you have a dead line to meet and this computer won\u0027t let you out.","Since we typically use a mouse, we deactivated the pad and went about our business.","The extra scroll button for the mouse is really handy as well as the keyboard light built into the screen.","I have two 500GB hard drives, a industrial laser printer, speaker system, and wireless mouse/keyboard hooked to it.","With Windows Vista, you can delete them with just a few mouse pad taps.","Also kind of neat was a built in meter right on the battery itself which is accessed by setting up the Q1\u0027s stand and then you could push a little button on the battery and it will show you power level on it\u0027s LEDs- \"AVS\" Program: Reading about this, it is supposed to be a mini OS that can play movies and music and show pictures without having to go into the Main OS, but I could never get it to not fire up Vista before running.... so basically it\u0027s useless for lack of a better description- Wireless/Internet: Bluetooth, Wireless a/b/g, and a direct Ethernet connection all work very well, I had no problems connecting to anything on my travels- Data Entry: Not really a big fan of the \"Orgami\" keyboard program, but the Tablet keyboard entry with the included stylus works well, but for serious typing a bluetooth/USB keyboard and/or mouse is recommended.","For this computer, I have so far bought an ac/dc converter for the car ($30 at radioshack), a samsonite case, a little wireless mouse, and a seagate 120 hard drive.","I may order a new battery if I start carrying it around.Big \"meh\" on the nipple mouse.","Keyboard has little bounce, trackpad is good, external USB mouse an obvious upgrade.Battery life for my system is 2.5-2.75 hours with full brightness, wi-fi on, browsing net and word processing, (standard battery), I\u0027d take it to be greater than 3 hrs with brightness low and wifi off (as I\u0027d use it in class).The system does lag quite a bit while burning CD-R\u0027s...but I wouldn\u0027t expect anyone to be doing much during that time period in any case.Placement of USB ports is quite nice, for right-handed persons.","For serious business use, the MacBook is just barely there and requires some additional investment (mouse, WWAN, extra battery, Parallels) but that\u0027s true of many Windows laptops as well.One star is subtracted from a perfect score for the strange design shortfalls (average Bluetooth support, sharp edge on the front of the case, so-so trackpad, less than great app stability, less than zippy response of apps.)I would recommend this product to almost anyone however, the Macintosh has re-arrived on the personal computing scene for sure.","I\u0027m a big fan of the mouse pointer in the on the keyboard and would not know what to do with out it.","Decent hardware for the price (got it for around $500 a few months ago, can\u0027t believe they\u0027re still selling it for close to $1000.)It runs Vista perfectly well, including the new Aero interface (contrary to the statement in another review.)Few irritating problems:- It has only one CTRL key, sitting on the left, so if

the CPU gets to the half of the speed! How nice!!! Also it eats the battery so fast, that you will not believe.","A month and a half later, in mid-March, I touched the touchpad to move the mouse and the notebook died again!! It was completely unresponsive to any attempts to revive it.","The first is my somewhat annoying \u0027squishy\u0027 mouse button.","I would recommend the purchase a wireless mouse instead of the using the touch pad.","The USB ports on either side make it easy to plug in other components like a mouse, scanner, camera, etc.The DVD burner works just fine, and it\u0027s so nice to be able to burn DVD\u0027s (the G3iBook only had CD)Overall I gave it a 4.","But I purchased a wireless mouse and for me it\u0027s a perfect setup.","The mouse pad is a little sketchy at times (cursor just goes wherever it feels like going) but the great thing about that is there\u0027s a button right above it so you can disable it (also, the space on the right of the mouse is big enough to use a usb mouse on).For someone who\u0027s actually considering buying this thing, its great for people in a dorm room (limited space) or in the military and goes TDY and will set it up in a room and leave it for weeks or months.","Touch pad mouse is not friendly at all.","This little guy is worth whatever you have to pay to get one.All my old accessories - mouse, printer, etc - work with it.WHY didn\u0027t I switch years ago?! Well, because of the price.Thank you, Amazon, for the rebate offer.Now I know that with Apple you actually DO get what you pay for, so the price won\u0027t stop me again.","Another brilliant, thoughtful design from ThinkPad.TrackPoint Device: In addition to a touchpad, ThinkPad still offers its classical TrackPoint device with two sets of mouse buttons, which I found more convenient than other pointing devices.Sturdy steel hinges: Not just cool-looking, they are the reinforced joint connecting the display with the rest of the machineFEATURES THAT LENOVO DIDN\u0027T MENTION ABOUT THINKPADI think Lenovo is too modest in marketing the ThinkPad.","The worst feature is the video card is weak, and the mouse is sluggish every now and then.","I wish they had made the power light pulse quickly or something.- Only a one-button mouse integrated on the machine.","Now the single mouse button (a bad idea) is at best on the blink and will need repairing.","When I got laptop working the wrist rest pad right next to the mouse pad was heating up to an uncomfortable level.","I have an old Dell laptop with the same style mouse and it never does that.Otherwise I like it so far, but a very basic thing like that gets annoying very quicly, so if you get one...check out that issue.","BTW the touchpad is also great tho I am using a wireless notebook usb mouse too.","Quad wi-fi a,b,g,n plus bluetooth.Gorgeous white finish with silver finish keyboard and trackpad, the wide trackpad/mouse pad matches the widescreen look of the 15.4 inch display, the mouse pad is very responsive, the buttons are soft and easy to press, the keyboard is perfect and appears smaller than normal laptop keyboards.","Everything worked fine but then I couldn\u0027t get the Bluetooth application on Sony\u0027s site (I could get the Bluetooth drivers but not the app that allows you to connect a mouse or other devices to the system).","I like the thumb mouse control button.","It makes using a mouse difficult at times.- The battery life isn\u0027t is good as I\u0027d hoped.- A little on the noise side.- The speakers aren\u0027t very loud, especially with DVDs.","I didn\u0027t like the original settings but once I changed it, I\u0027m not even considering getting a mouse.","Ditto the \"mouse\".","Getting a 17\u0026quot; bag is no easy task and if you are replacing a desktop I fully recommend getting a USB optical Mouse.","The touchpad actually work both as mouse and scroll wheel.","One thing I don\u0027t like though is the mouse track pad.","Finally, just a tiny thing, I wish that one of the USBs was on the back, instead of on the sides: I just prefer to plug my mouse in the back.Overall, we\u0027re extremely happy with this computer.","The touchpad mouse is an improvement from my last laptop as it is not quite as smooth and responds better to my movement.","The only problem I\u0027ve encountered is that the \"mouse pad\" seems extremely sensitive and initiates actions that I don\u0027t want to initiate.","But I have much better access and easier use now that I have a wireless laser mouse attached to it.","This might also be due to the large size, but there is a lot of space between the keyboard and the mouse area.","A VGA-out is on the back so connecting a second monitor is easy, along with 10/100 Ethernet, modem, USB, keyboard and mouse ports.","The power jack is on the back right hand side of the computer and gets in the way of the cord for the mouse, may be time to go wireless.","The DVD burner is nice and the mouse is very cool.","I don\u0027t like these as you get weird behaviors when you meant to move the mouse and one of these takes over instead.","Only negative is that the keyboard spacings isn\u0027t comfortable, but I use a mouse anyway so it is great!! This computer is great when it comes to raw power.","the second one had some issue with mouse cursor freezing up.","When I moved my finger left, the mouse moved right; down was up; vice-versa.I initially attributed this to a one-time glitch, so I simply rebooted my computer.","This may not be the case, however, because i have a few friends who also bought Averatec laptops, and they\u0027ve had to reinstall their drivers for their mouse, sound or usb drives several times.","I can\u0027t get the settings right and mostly use a mouse instead.5) The video uses \"shared\" (i.e., \"stolen\") RAM, meaning your 512Mb is really 448Mb, or 384Mb if you go to 128Mb vram like others have suggested.6) The case is made of a plastic that feels flimsy and scratches easily.7) The firewire port is the irritating smaller S400, so you\u0027ll probably need a special cable.","I changed the trackpad settings under \"keyboard and mouse\" to add dragging and took off \"ignore accidental trackpad input\".","Which I was able to plug the receiver into one of t he USB and the mouse worked without any additional software.","I\u0027ve had mine for 2 weeks now and I love it!

The fact that it\u0027s that convenient now motivates me to do it more often than I was before.If I had to find a drawback to this computer, I\u0027d say it\u0027s the fan.","I imagine if the loud fan REALLY got to you, you could take it in to a shop and have a quieter fan put in....not sure how feasible that would be, but cant see why it wouldnt work.","It\u0027s a great computer for traveling (you can really notice the difference between it and a full size MBP in a backpack).To optimize performance, you should upgrade to 1.1 GB RAM (costs around thirty dollars), buy a faster hard drive (a 160GB 5400 rpm ATA drive for around sixty), and install OSX 10.4, which is far faster than any of the previous OSX releases, and is marginally faster than 10.5.If the fan comes on too frequently, try using some compressed air to blow dust out of the computer, or better yet, open it up and give it a good cleaning.","I have been an \"Apple\" fan for years.","My last Toshiba\u0027s rear fan occasionally left me feeling medium-rare.","I upgraded another 512 of memory and checked the cooling fan and it is working.","The fan does come on, and it is pretty loud.","Since I started to use Windows XP default energy manager fan works very little and only when I\u0027m runing high demanding programs.","I was a 14inch ibook fan, only reason i got the 12inch was because the 14inch was out of stock.","The computer gets so hot, it actually burnt out one of the fans in the chill pad.","The fans are very loud when they kick in and I do keep this on a fan pad, otherwise it heats up very quickly.The only other issue is that the battery dies very quickly (so it must be treated like a desktop) but overall this machine is very fast for when it was built and does not drag at all with standard specifications.","I was an avid PC fan that even ridiculed and hated Apple products.","I used an external fan at the time it blew out.","At first i bought a Sony Vaio FRV-37 but I didn\u0027t like its 2 lbs adapter and noisy fan and then I got Toshiba centrino instead.","Pro: Fabulous screen, great form factorCon: Unbelievably annoying fan, unreliable, mediocre build quality(note: I have the VGN-S260P - same notebook w/smaller HD)Sony is the closest thing the Windows world has to Apple level product design.","I love everything about this computer, except the loud and annoying fan.","At work, the first order of the day was to calibration the fan which took about 20 minutes.","I think HP could have designed in a smarter fan speed controller, so that it only sounds like a vacuum cleaner when the CPU is really getting a workout (gaming and such).","Even with the most aggressive power saving settings the fan will run - even when the machine is sitting doing nothing with the screen off! And it is not just that it runs - it is variable speed and yet it cycles on and off at ~10 second intervals, you can\u0027t imagine how annoying that is, it would be better if it just would pick a middling speed and stay on.","And \"Extended contact with the computer or adapter may cause discomfort.\"---I agree with \"Amazon Fan\" almost 100%.","I used to consider Sony a high quality brand and now they have destroyed their own reputation.I think there should be a class action lawsuit again Sony on the fan problem.For the same price, you can buy a much higher quality IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad, which I have owned for over four years and it works excellently.","I noticed it had a very high pitched noise coming from the fan, and this is when I\u0027m not even using it!

I\u0027d long since been off warranty.I also went out and dropped 20 dollars on an extrernal antec laptop fan.","Bought this for my wife because she is not a PC fan.","The fan is a bit noisey.","The things I am not satisfied with are:1.The noise of the fan;2.The keyboard.Any way, it is a good buy.PS: You may consider ThinkPad X60s if better performance is desired.","The exhaust from the cpu fan is on the right side of the laptop and when using the mouse (which I use 99% of the time) then my mouse and my hand gets very hot.","Several features will surprise Mac fans:- Although it\u0027s only 13.3 inches, the clairty and brightness of the screen makes for easy viewing.","I have yet to explore the (integrated) web cam feature, but I am pretty excited about it.If you are a Sony notebook fan, you can\u0027t go wrong with this product.","Mostly the fan-It produces a lot of heat.-Battery time (I expected to last at least 3 hours).","The fan will only come on when the laptop is superhot.","Within few months, I noticed that cooling fan was always on, i contacted sony customer service they told me that i had a set up problem.Since last 6 months, laptop was getting overheated and crashed so many times.","A simple use of Dust Off being sprayed into the bottom fan intake blew out lots of dust and no more random shut downs.The only two things bad I found was the short battery life and the fact that in less than a year my battery life has decreased to less than a half an hour on two different batteries no.","The computer is in great shape like the seller said it was a great price for what the price was the battery doesn\u0027t stay charged without the charger but it still was a good price.Thank you The computer is nice from a design point of view but has a fatal flaw. the heat from the exhaust fan is so hot that you can\u0027t put it on your lap for any period of time.","Laptops often do that anyway and the pad/fan works wonders.","When on my lap both fan locations are almost always open.","My former laptop was a Presario 2500 and the screen wasn\u0027t bright enough without having it maxed out which reduces battery time.Good keyboard ,sound is very good, only negative is the cpu fan runs constantly but not real loud.","That\u0027s why Averatec was the best choice for me.I have also noticed that the fan is slightly noisy and just like most laptops, it tends to get warm (but not HOT).","If you walk by my office it sounds like I have a floor fan running in there.","It\u0027s not an issue with the laptop but I figured those Chrome fans out there would like to know that I\u0027ve had an unfortunate experience with it on this MBP.Finally, it runs pretty cool on average but when I run a VM or a few things at once it does tend to heat up and I end up turning up the fan speed with SmcFanControl.","I was told by Sony that the fan was not on in the store because it wss bssically being used as a \"TV\" not a computer.","After about a year and a half of this the fan started to weaken and now I can hear it run (it\u0027s pretty loud).","We sent it in for warranty repair in August 2006 and it was returned like new, with a new battery and power cord.Now, in March 2007, the power cord is falling out, battery life is very short and the computer gets very hot, causing the fan to run on high.HP will not repair the computer under warranty in the 15th month, even though they repaired the same problem six months ago.I have another HP laptop (dv5000) which had a serious conflict with an HP All In One.","I feel it was a cop out on the part of the HP designers not to include a smarter fan speed controller.Other than that, I think it\u0027s one of the best values out there.","1st, let me start by saying, I\u0027ve never really been the biggest fan of laptops in general but for this I have to make an exception.","I chose to purchase this over the Compaq 1720US because of the addition of an extra USB port, PCMCIA slot, and better graphics card.Unfortunately, I have had the same problem with both machines, a loud whirling fan and a clicking hard drive.","The fan runs constantly(see above) and the undercarrage cooks your lap - or table - or probably your grilled cheeze if you put one under there.Toshiba Software for H*ll! - to quote C.Bing - \"Could they load ANY more useless Toshiba software at start-up?\"Software Extras - all crud...","I have always been a big fan of sony, but not anymore.","This model is also not suspected to the battery recall that has been going on lately, so you can buy in confidence that your battery will not randomly explode.Ventilation is all on the left hand side of the system, (fan blows out the back, however the airflow is pulled from the bottom) so if you are using it on your lap, you will find yourself putting the right side of the computer on your lap.","The keyboard needs some time to get used to, but the keys are a pleasure to type on and very speedy (I do agree with the other person who said that they needed to expand the keyboard a bit and or put a keypad next to it since there is a large wasted space - but you have to also consider the components within).The only reason I did not buy the HP is because the cooling sucks... my friend has one (not the 17\" model though) and he needs an external fan to cool it.","It makes a \"unique\" sound when the fan runs at full speed.The machine is nice, but the screen (in his model) is dull in color, and if calibrated, not very bright at all.If parent company Gateway stays afloat, eMachines can continue selling great value notebooks.","Fan is constantly on.","It\u0027s relatively thin and quite(unless fan kicks in \u0026lt; 5% of time).","I think the issue is that the fan just doesn\u0027t work.","(-;The laptop is nice and quiet except intermittently the cpu fan will come on for no reason.Overall the laptop feels very solid and the only thing I have not really tested are the battery discharge times.The only OS I tested this with is Ubuntu Linux and everything worked out of the box except for the flash card reader; There is supposedly a driver in the works for that.","I have been a long time fan of Sony technology, and in my lifetime have purchased 5 Sony PC\u0027s (two desktops, three laptops in total).","Also get the I8K GUI software to control your fans and monitor your CPU and GPU so you know when it is time to service it yourself.","I have never been a fan of touch pads, and in fact purchased a small portable USB mouse when I purchsed the computer.","I would recommend trying one first at a Best Buy or circuit city.Pros:- Attractive design -

The fan does get a little noisy at times, but I haven\u0027t taken it to a classroom yet to see if it matters.","I have always been a loyal apple fan.","The 12-inch is fine - it\u0027s much clearer than my old PC notebook - but if I had the opportunity, I\u0027d probably go with the bigger monitor.DRAWBACKS-While most software is available for Mac OS X, there are some programs that aren\u0027t (Google toolbar, Yahoo! toolbar, Kazaa, AvantGo) or minor problems in software that is available (Quicken can\u0027t access accounts on Ameritrade via Macs)-The PowerBook doesn\u0027t have a fan, which is great for the battery, but can cause it to get a bit hot underneath where the user rests his left hand.Regardless of those drawbacks, however, buying a Mac was an easy decision.","I don\u0027t have a problem with heat or noisy fans like the previous reviewer.","It would have been so easy for averatec to put in a quieter fan.","I wasn\u0027t a fan of touchpads, but this one has a good feel to it, along with the keyboard.","My only complaint, and its commnon to these laptops, is the CPU fan.","The fan isn\u0027t loud at all.10.)","I totally agree with hardware fan from NY and California and more.","Second, there is a heat issue that can cause the laptop to shut down in the middle of whatever it is doing, but only seems to happen when dust builds up in the fan or the fan is otherwise blocked.","Pro: Fabulous screen, great form factorCon: Unbelievably annoying fan, unreliable, mediocre build quality(note: I have the VGN-S260P - same notebook w/Pentium 735, smaller HD and only DVD-ROM)Sony is the closest thing the Windows world has to Apple level product design.","I notice the fan as one person was talking about but it\u0027s was very small occasional noise that is hardly noticeable at all even when I was falling asleep with one hand eye on this beauty and one eye closed.I compared this next to the Sony viao, and couldn\u0027t get my self to spend $2,000 for the smallest lightest unit.","Finally don\u0027t leave this monster on while trying to speak or sleep, its fan is too loud.","Its fan good enough to cool down the processor in a small amount of time (after I quit from 2-3 hour game, it takes 2 seconds to lower the fan speed).","WRONG!!! What a piece of unmitigated garbage! Compared to my earlier Presario, this piece of junk has;1) Very poor display resolution2) Very poor washed out weak display colors3) Very slow for a 2.4 GHz P4, slower than my P3 1.0Ghz4) AWFUL sound, not even close to my other Presario5) An AC adapter that has such a poor pin input fit it won\u0027t stay plugged in even when untouched!!! Just falls out.6) Super loud fan that seems to be perpetually on, you can\u0027t think or hear anything else with this thing!I understand what happened here I think.","In the meantime I replaced it with the 13.3\" Durabook and that is working fine.My observations from my brief time with the N15RI are: I liked the keyboard (others have complained about it,but I found it to have a nice feel), screen is adequate, I liked that it came with very little preloaded software to clutter it up (pretty much just XP, IE, Intel wifi and Norton), As others have commented it did run VERY HOT, and as the fan is on the bottom (?) anything underneath (including your lap) gets scorched (could this have something to do with the failure?).","It takes 5 minutes to boot, the fan constantly blows, and CPU is always at 60%.","If there is anything I could change on this I wold ge quieter fans but that comes with any laptop.","The fan also kicks in frequently.","The AV has a PC card slot, the iBook does not, but since networking is built-in, what would one possibly put in there? And did I mention that the AV fan is very noisy?Another little detail: The iBook power supply lets you wrap the cable around it thanks to 2 fold-out hooks, for the AV power supply I had to get a strap to tame the cable.And last not least, the edge of the trackpad on my AV rubs against the screen when it is closed and leaves a 1.5\" long mark.","The cooling fan is a little loud but you become accustomed to the whirring sound.2.","I lagged a lot watching Youtube..probably because the ads are too much for the video card to read...That\u0027s why it\u0027s safe to say this PC isn\u0027t meant for multi-tasking4)FAN GETS HOT EASILY!...seeing how it is a 2.8 GHz...I would understand..but the fan is really hot...It scares me every time I try to leave this PC on during the night, it might blow upBasically if you\u0027re the person who aren\u0027t into PC games and just wanna get the work done, this computer is great for you but I wouldn\u0027t even recommend watching a movie on this baby.","But that is not all, the fan noise is not just the air moving, it is obviously a very cheap motor because the noise is predominantly motor/bearing noise of a character that after a few minutes drives you nuts and makes you want to go out and do something very antisocial.","So far so good, except for the clicking noise when accessing the hard drive and loud fan once in a while.","I\u0027m a husker fan.. who can\u0027t beat red, and the awesome comments taking it out for airport security.","The one program I did need was MS Office 2008 and the installation using my iMac\u0027s drive was flawless and straightforward.As many around the \u0027net have stated I can\u0027t imagine this being anyone\u0027s primary computer but as a travel companion and for web-surfing, e-mail and documents Mac fans need not hesitate.I haven\u0027t used any processor intensive programs such as Photoshop or VMWare but I don\u0027t have to: that\u0027s why I have my iMac.","The fan is nonexistent and my macbook pro runs cooler than my acer, and the warmness feels good on my lap, all while beating my old acer\u0027s performance.","ANYWAY, there is a class-action lawsuit in the works against Toshiba regarding the fact that they were producing fans for their laptops that couldn\u0027t handle the speeds of the processors they were also using.","I had the CD-ROM break and got it replaced and the fan is very loud and I got it cleaned out and it still is pretty loud.","Recommended!

(I guess that\u0027s why Sony call it notebook instead of laptop.)","It died three times during the time period that I owned it, and after replacing the hard drive twice and the fan once, I realized that it just wasn\u0027t worth trying to \"fix\" anymore.Unfortunately, I received the exact same model of laptop as a gift after my previous one died.","The Sony has a small vent so the fan has to ramp up to move more air to keep the CPU cool.","I would say it is a silent laptop without annoying fan noises.This is my second Sony laptop.","I have a Dell laptop, but I can\u0027t hear the fan on my Dell\u0027s even when I press my ear against it.","Two minor quibbles are the stupid placement of the headphone jack on the front and the fan on the bottom.","In addition, the rather loud fans kick in when the processor is going full steam.The one major concern for any user should be Sony\u0027s repair policies and capabilities.","This also wears the battery out faster.HP forums are filled with people angry at HP\u0027s unwillingness to actually FIX the problem.Tech suppport basically laughed at me because they said in a nut shell \"it is kind of a lame reason to send it back for the fan\".I did not send it back a second time because I\u0027m in IT and I know it is a bios issue.","I have seen the fans were running around 3000-3500 rpm during this time.","I would have returned this within the first week if I didn\u0027t need the cooling capabilities of this fan so badly.","Also - There\u0027s a fan/cpu calibration in the bios that must be run when you first get the unit...I don\u0027t understand why people seem to miss that step in the manual.","I am the fan of sony but after this one, I won\u0027t go for sony laptop again i brought this laptop 6 months ago, and boy...dont i love it!!!! its real sleek, lightweight, highly responsive, runs all my apps satisfactorily!cons: i have not come across any yet! i brought this laptop and it works great with the exception that the cursor goes where it want to go while typing so you have to find where the mistakes are and correct them over and over again.","Expect the fan to run at least 50% of the time if you use it for longer than 10 minutes.Overall a great little notebook and I would buy it again.","The fan is also starting to fail, but again, it\u0027s due to dirt and grime.With the one persons comment about the keyboard keys wearing off, and then saying they\u0027re going to get an IBM, (Lenovo), at one of the MWR\u0027s, (internet centers), almost all the keys have worn off, guess what, they\u0027re IBM\u0027s.","I also play some pretty intense 3D games as well, although the FPS is a bit sluggish at times, it\u0027s not bad enough to stop me from playing.About the only thing I really have a complaint about is the fan, noisy as all get out! I have removed it and checked the bearings and made sure it was clean of debris, but it\u0027s still pretty noisy.I sometimes will leave the system on 24/7 for up to a week while I am compiling code or running a series of tests against UNIX main frames or other Linux systems.","The fan noise is very erratic also - goes up and down like nobody\u0027s business.","have others had this problem? I have read many reviews for this laptop and the number one complaint is how loud the fans are.","I have had no problems with it, except that the fans are really loud and can get pretty hot, so can the adapter.","The fan gets to sound about like a PC desktop, but higher-pitched.","My MBP from a couple of years ago didn\u0027t have an audible fan noise, and the fan never kicked into \"high gear\" like this one does on occasion.","However there definetly are some things I do not like- it gets very hott- the mooing noise of the fans can get VERY annoying- battery life w/wireless on is only around 3 hrs- 512 RAM is not enough- 60 gig is not enoughFor the same price in a pc laptop you could get a laptop that is probably faster and has around a 100 gig hard drive.","i take mine to lecture most of the time.pros:nice \"stamina\" and \"speed\" features allows you to switch between two different video cards.battery life is decent... i can get about 3.5 hours on stamina mode and about 1-2 hours on speed.fast! the core duo 2 and 1 gb ram makes it good for multitasking.bluetooth feature makes it easy to share photos from my phone.memory card readers, its a cool feature, but i have a feeling i wont use it muchvery nice intergrated microphone.cons:the fingerprint reader is a bit hard to use, the positioning of it and desing makes it hard to get a clean read when swiping, so sometimes it takes a few tries.not a big fan of the glossy screen...overall construction feels a bit flimsy.. this is my first sony laptop...and light/thin but the cd drive feels like it would break if i put remotely any pressure on it, especially when it comes to loading cds and stuff.","I was worried at first but Lenovo has carried the Thinkpad torch superbly into the production of the T60 model.PROS:-Build quality is second to none.-Integrates MS Office Applications easily into hardware.-Super long battery life and high performance options.-Great tactile keyboard and you can buy a keyboard in various languages and type fonts.-All the parts are easily user removable, user replaceable, and user serviceable!-Great customer support at Lenovo!-Unique features like waterproof keyboard, airbag, roll cage, fingerprint security, Thinkpad manager, etc...-SXGA and UXGA resolution screens!-Quiet dust proof fan.CONS:- No SD or Memory Card slots but you can easily buy a PC adapter card.- Runs hot on surfaces like beds and cushions and fan is not super quiet when laptop is hot.- Video Memory options are scant on the T60 models.","The iBook G4 is simply awesome! I am/was a windows fan, born and raised.","The problems began to grow worse with time:- Hotter running.- Noisier fan, as a consequence.- The wireless network interface would randomly shut off (i\u0027ve read this happens to the miniPCI Intel wireless card used in this and a few other machines - an update from Microsoft temporarily relieved the problem, but it started up again).- The web cam was invisible to Vista in all ways except being listed in the device manager as \"working properly.\"","First view is great design/color; light weight, functional built in camera! After using you discover; plastic casing parting in front seam,keyboard loose on left side, and fan inefficient at cooling system.","Some people may find cooling-fan and hard-disk a little noisy \u0026 annoying - Being a computer professional I\u0027m OK with those4.","Eventually, the cooling fan gave out.","O.k. - I\u0027m biased - I\u0027ve been a Mac fan for a LONG time.","I used to consider Sony a high quality brand and now they have destroyed their own reputation.I think there should be a class action lawsuit again Sony on the fan problem.","I could not hear any considerable noise difference from the fans.","The fan is noisy, and the laptop itself gets really hot.","Thank you sony the grx550 is #1 please dont stop building this modle I went to buy this laptop and I\u0027m still struggling to hear its fan as it\u0027s really quiet.","This laptop would be perfect for a college student!

Another upside is that it has everything in terms of PC interfaces.","Overall, not bad, but I wish the fan wasn\u0027t dying on me.","this baby is quiet, in fact, you\u0027d really have to prop your ears next to the air vents to hear the fans whir. i\u0027ve only heard the fans kick on once when i had it on my lap playing a dvd and photoshopping at the same time.","Perhaps because mine has 1 GB RAM installed.The one thing that bugs me is the loud fan.","I rarely hear the fan/s kick on and I worry about traveling with this unit.","One of the favorite descriptions of Mac fans, to describe Macs, is simply, \"it just works.\"The iBook continues to include iLife \u002705, with great applications such as iPhoto, iMovie HD, iDVD, iTunes, and Garageband.","The Averatec boots up extremely fast, the fan always turns on for the first 10 seconds or so, but after that rarely runs.","Pros- Price- SpeedCons- Noisy fan, gigantic AC adspter- Takes forever to boot- Do not even attemp to listen music, the sound quality is awfulFor the money, it\u0027s a deal..","With Parallels running Windows XP, it it really the ultimate laptop solution for everyone to get the best of both worlds.BTW, this machine is very quiet and you can hardly hear its fan noise unleas you are running tye CPU 100%.","After that, the fan was MUCH more quiet.","For a student like me, who does only weekend travels, this laptop is just perfect, except the NOISY fan, which is really irritating sometimes.","But that is not all, the fan noise is not just the air moving, it is obviously a very cheap motor because the noise is predominantly motor/bearing noise of a character that after a few minutes drives you nuts and makes you want to go out and do something very antisocial.","The fan is kind of noisy.2.","Don\u0027t get me wrong Asus also makes a great computer, but this little Black Mac has changed me forever from a PC-anti-Mac-Man to an Apple Fan-For-Life!

Every other Windows keepboard has it lower left between CTRL and ALT.","Operation is very quiet in general, although the fan does occasionally become noisier when extra cooling is required.","The Gateway M505X which has the more advanced Pentium M (1.4 GHz which is equivalent to perhaps a 2.4 GHz P4)) does not run the fan at all during most uses (probably would if one ran games, etc.), and the hard drive is virtually inaudible.","I have noticed that the power management software on my 3225 doesn\u0027t work well; in the default setting, the fan comes on more than necessary, slowing down the computer.","I also subscribed to the Cingular EDGE WWAN plan and the speed is poor but better than nothing if you are stuck without a WLAN nearby.I\u0027m not happy with the lack of restore disks and the fact that a fairly large part of the HD is taken up by restore files and thus unusable.I\u0027ve also had intermittent problems with the sleep/hibernate feature causing lock-ups.Another negative is the fan noise.","However, I was a fan of their iPod technology (owning four.)","There is more!!! If you are looking for Bluetooth, a nice display resolution, silent cooling fans or even just FOR a nice looking laptop, get this one.- I found that Bluetooth is available and it works fine with my Sony Ericsson mobile.- As it says, the native resolution is 1440x900 but it is 1400x1050 but I use the higgest which is 1680x1050.","The fact that the fan seldom kicks in makes the ibook a truly quiet machine and with an external keyboard and a stand it makes a great desktop replacement.","The video card works, but is weak when it comes to Vista standards and games (see below.)- The fan kicks on quite often.","Between the small 100GB drive, random loss of networking and the RATTLING and VIBRATING fan, i desperately disassembled the unit to clean the fan and install a new hard drive.Laptops are not meant to be serviced.","$330 later I had a new CPU fan/cooler and the 4 screws installed..","The fan is a little noisy, but then again all the other notebooks my friends have are even louder! Its only the pitch that\u0027s a little annoying but something that people would get used to.","The fan is VERY VERY LOUD.","The only time I ever knew the earlier models had a fan were when I left one open on a bed, for example, and came back to realize it had been doing the slow burn.","You need to play music while working so you could minimize the distraction that the fan could cause.","IT looks very nice, but the fan noise and the overheating were disturbing.","Its fan stays on but it has a wider vent so the fan is slower and therefore has a much lower pitch than the Sony.","She\u0027s an avid Mac fan and has been \"pushing\" me to get a Mac for some time, but I\u0027m a \"PC Guy\" and I use Windows.","I now routinely get over 3 hours on my battery, 1 year after purchase, and the fan rarely comes on.","In that case the performance is great but the fan is running full speed and the battery goes quick.","i\u0027m generally a big fan of Sony.","To add insult to injury, despite packing it very carefully and inserting a note to please be careful, it returned with a big scratch on the lid.All of that would be forgivable if it wasn\u0027t for the most unbelievably annoying fan I have ever experienced.","I can even alt-tab between playing a game and writing a paper without lag if I want.-The system is speedy, and the wifi card can pick up even really weak signals (like some of the ones on my campus) with no problems.-The speakers aren\u0027t worth listening to music on, but a pair of headphones should solve that problem for you.-I would recommend getting a Spire PacificBreeze cooling fan for this.","However, it is a little heavy and the fan is noisy.","The issues varied from a defective battery, to a defective power supply, to defective system fans and overheating, to locking up unexpectedly.","I have owned this laptop for almost a year and a half.I needed a desktop replacement for my small home office and it has been wonderful for that.This machine gets quite hot if held on the lap and even on the desk, the loud fans run fairly frequently.","The speakers blew out after 2 days, the fan is obnoxiously loud, and the speed is incredibly slow for a 2.4gh because of the slow system bus.","This will increase the airflow to the fan as well, so worth the investment.So do NOT believe the naysayers.....RUN, don\u0027t walk to the nearest outlet and buy one of these.","The fans are located such that one can\u0027t have the machine laying flat on a table (At least for cooling effect, I wouldn\u0027t risk it) When the machine goes warm, it works considerably slower and is prone to hang on processes.SW users, this is a good machine for this program.","Fan is barely inaudible if it is on, and doesn\u0027t burn the skin like other laptops I\u0027ve used.Cons1) Buttons for the touchpad are pretty small and hard to hit.","When Sony makes this laptop thin and small, everything needs to put it closer together so it will generate more heat than usual thus it needs the STRONGER fan and it needs to run more often.I also own a giant Gateway Centrino 1.2GHz (6 lbs) and I can say that the Gateway is a little quieter (fan) than Sony but again it\u0027s a lot bigger than Sony.","Many positives have been said about this computer and I agree it has many positives, BUT a big negative can bring its whole appeal down: the fan is tooo noisy and it is operating most of the time even when set to \"Level 1 (quiet)\".","However, I noticed the fan noise was too intrusive.","I\u0027ve read that most heat is produced by the video card GPU, and there is an option available for reducing heat production and fan noise by decreasing the GPU speed, but I bought this laptop because of the dedicated video card so I don\u0027t see myself using that option.About the fan issue, it is not even an issue; it is not at all noisy.","Second, ibook is so quiet, I never hear the fan.","Unless you are a SONY fan like me you could save some money and purchase a different brand.","I\u0027m Sony fan.","After 4 months of use, here are some things I consider notable:+ Clean exterior lines, glossy-black exterior with sharp-cut edges contrasting with simple, polished silver interior+ No annoying, high pitched capacitor whine+ hibernation/sleep/wake is flawless+ sweat from your palm does not permanently stain the enamel finished palmrest+ fan noise really low after April 2006 BIOS release update+ included Microsoft OneNote 2003 is quite useful with great UI+ LCD: LG Philips LPG6500 15\" XGA TFT+ HDD: Toshiba MK4026GAX 40GB 5400RPM with 16MB cache+ Takes power efficient DDR2 4200 Memory (compared to DDR) (Hynix DDR2-533 1.8V 256MB preinstalled)+ Optical Drive: TSST TS-L462C- Noisy optical drive (unless you set the quiet drive utility manually, which always defaults into \"noisy mode\")- Celeron Processor does not throttle down even when doing nothing- Left palm area warm- BATTERY LIFE (~1hr, 4 cell 29 Watt hour basic pack)- no card reader or IEEE 1394All in all, Toshiba really packs some high quality components into this nicely designed/built \"budget\" notebook.","I\u0027ve been an Apple fan for a long time, and I hope that at least the first two of the following problems will soon be resolved, but for the time being:(1) The keyboard quite often freezes and there does not seem to be a consistent solution.","After a year my only concern is the fact that it runs hot if I am working longer than 8 hours a day with it (university use, programming) but I solved this little problem of mine with an additional fan pad you plug in via USB port.","It makes me not want to use the notebook as much! I\u0027ve been using a PCG-FX340 sony vaio that I got in 2001, and am really missing how it doesn\u0027t actually burn my hand as I use it.The fan is noticeable.","However haven\u0027t i been in Iraq it would never occur well i fried my mother board also at that time the fan was making more noise than normal and the technicians told me that it was extremely dirty not a surprise since I was in the Middle East - it was a relatively easy fix since It was under the warranty - lucky me! I sent it to sony they replaced it and returned to me fine and since then not even one single complain.Since 2004 I\u0027ve been to over 7 countries and always had my Vaio in my bag (a map bag).","I knocked a star off my review because of the battery life and the (I assume necessary) fan sound.","If you are UNIX fan like me, then you will definitely like MAC OS X.","I\u0027ve been a Mac fan for about 20 years but have been using windows and linux laptops for the last 10 years or so because of compatibility requirements with my work.","I bumped up the memory to 2GB just to give Windows room; it may be possible to run with just 1GB, but I did not mind spending the extra $140 for the memory.Plus points: powerful processor, big big screen, nice enough keyboard, quiet fans, nice speakers, bluetooth integration, price is competitive with other PCs.Negative points: DVD drive died and replaced under warranty in the first week, big screen means more weight, and hot machine (don\u0027t put it on your lap unless you are sitting inside an igloo).Intangible point: a Microsoft consultant said to me: \"Your laptop is really cool; who makes that?\" Ha.","It works great, though the fan is loud and comes on a lot, otherwise it\u0027s excellent...small, slim, light weight and enough RAM and memory for everything I need.","I\u0027m not a real fan of Nortons and it does come with the software package, but it would be unfair to blame it on them, but...Anyway, the computer itself, when working, is awesome.","It runs HOT like a furnace as the fans try to cool the machine.This leads to the 2nd part of power management - battery life.","Fan stays on at varying speeds to maintain temperature below 50 deg C. Battery lasts about 2.5 hours with wireless connection on.","The Ti never ran this hot and contrary to another reviewer on this site, the fan is on about 25% of the time.","About three months after I got it, it started shutting off whenever it wanted, more and more frequently, and the fan WILL NOT STOP, even when the CPU usage is below 3%!!! I sent it back, not once, but twice! Same problem over and over again.","Two emails to customercare@averatec (inquiring about the fan) were echoed back with no comment!?! So, not sure about support yet.","I\u0027ve only had mine 3 weeks, but so far, it really rocks! If you buy a Sony laptop, be prepared to pay \u003e$250 to replace a dead fan after the warranty expiresI completely agree with the review by [Laptop Professional \"Anonymous Owner\"].","The only thing I would have liked better would be a longer lasting battery (I estimate about 2 hours with the standard battery) I just read other\u0027s reviews about the fan and I have to say I had the same problem... until I uninstalled the Sony energy saving software.","Yes, you can hear the fan run sometimes, but I can also hear the fan run in my company IBM Thinkpad.2.","Plus I wasn\u0027t a fan of the drive tray.","As a result, the fan was constantly running at top speed.","Buying this computer was like throwing money into the fire as I literally watched it fall apart before my eyes.The fan is extremely loud (like my classmates turned around and looked at my loud), the battery only last at most 2 hours (less if running iTunes, listening to a CD or watching a DVD) and it gets extremely hot when used for more than 2 hours- both on your wrists while typing and on the bottom making it very difficult to actually sit in your lap.My internal wireless broke as did my CD burner in less than 3 months.","I made sure there is good air flow to the fan.","I\u0027ve replaced hinges(very hard), screens(very hard), keyboard(easy), touchpad(easy), fans(medium - you need CPU paste).","My IBM T40 sometimes comes up with a \"Fan error\" when it tries to restore from sleep or bootup.","Good and fast laptop,i like it,the only 4 stars is because is running a bit hot,you need a fan under it.","I have been a Toshiba fan for a while.","Fan also becomes incredibly loud (far lounder than my Thinkpad T42).","I purchased the extended warranty from where I purchased my unit and am hoping that they will not tell me the same.I\u0027ve always been a fan of most HP products but I\u0027m now dreading the idea that I may have just flushed over $1000 down the drain.","I say if u wanna play games on this laptop, you gotta replace the video card, fan system, and the 1 GB memory.However with a 1 GB, you can\u0027t play most current games...like Crysis, Half-Life, Fear, and Call of Duty...Mabbe just some videos and to write a paper..","Anyway, i see many ppl giving 1 and 2 star bcoz of the overheat and noisy fan issue.","Invest in external drives, sony memory stick, etc, etcexpensive product overall.-------The tricky part with this computer is that it\u0027 s so small, that mechanical parts are phone to fail quickly.Mine, the fan broke in just 1.5 years of owning.Then the mouse got stuck on lower- right corner and never worked again.","Constant and loud fan noise!3.","The fan is noisy too and it is really slow.","I guess a lot of XP machines have had trouble with such hiccups, so you be the judge.Yes the fan is noticable, but pleasant for a fan, I suppose.","Due to its 17 inch screen, the one thing this computer has is space, its wide, yet, they choose a touch pad that is simply ridiculous, it is 6cm wide, yet only 4cm can be used, the other 2 cm actually lock the pad... in other words you have a almost 40cm wide computer with a 4 cm wide touchpad....simply hate it.4) No firewire, I could not believe it actually has no firewire yet it say s it does.5)It does not have the compact flash card size, so if you use this type of card for digi cameras, you are no good.6)Fan, 20min on and its a constant fan battle, noise, comes and goes, not good.7)Locks up with Explorer.","This is just annoying and for a $2000 notebook, Sony should spend more effort to design a better keyboard.Another drawback is the noise of the CPU fan when I worked late alone.","It runs very hot and the fan is going all the time.","The computer is great it has everything i need, but the fan is on the bottom and when it gets hot it just cuts off.","The fan is barely noticeable even if you really intently listen for it, and there is absolutely no heat problem.","The fan is frustratingly noisy and it goes off every thirty seconds because of the heat the processor generates.","I run the fans at minimum 3000rpm using smcFanControl, just to be sure.- Leopard takes some getting used to if you loved Tiger, but feels much more solid and snappy.","I found the battery life short, and the fan very annoying, but if you cruise the Averatec forums there are some very simple fixes for this.","I guess the hard drive, which is located right next to the fan, just got extremely hot and stopped working.","this is junk, do not buy! pos- robust spec: core2 Duo T7200, 2G memory, 160G HDD, DVD-RW, 801.11 1/b/g wireless and 12.1\" LCD- best price compared to the specs.- bright LCD, light weight, nice and firm body design- built-in FireWire and 5-in-1 memory card reader- lots of connectivity (3 usbs)- vista ?con- lots of heat from side vent.- kind of noisy (fan)- no bluetooth- I got a dead pixel in the middle of LCD- vista !!! POWER CORD FAILURE, WON\u0027T LAST.","I, like to many other people, bought this Sony laptop...The DVD-RW never really worked that great but after 1-year it died completely...My girlfriend also bought a Sony Vaio a few months after I did and the DVD-RW died on hers too...Its amazing how things like this happen right after the warranty expires...Almost seems like the Sony engineers design them that way...My laptop overheats like some of the other reviews have stated...I find that if I continually blow the processor fan off with compressed air to keep the dust down it helps a little...Sony Technical support is a Joke...My suggestion...Don\u0027t buy Sony...Go with Toshiba...You will be much happier...As for me...I will never purchase another Sony product again...","While it is better than the previous version, the battery life is atrocious, booting speed is circa-1997, and the noise from the fans must hit several thousand decibels.I am usually an easy customer to satisfy, but this is one company I am staying far away from (after numerous incidents).","For every one person who writes a bad review here, there are 1000 happy ones - just keep that in mind.Pluses:Aluminum case is extremely strong, scratch resistant and solid feelingKeyboard is firm with excellent depth of th keysDisplay hinge is sturdier than any other laptop I\u0027ve seenPorts on sides are easily accessible and thoughtfully layed outSlot loading cdSpeakers are unusually good for a laptop - great separationDisplay is gorgeous, crisp and bright - and enormousWeighs only 5.6 pounds and is only an inch thickSILENT: have never heard a fan go on in this baby.","There is hardly a sound from the computer, and unless I\u0027m doing processor-intensive work (like watching Quicktime HD sample movies), the fan is never on.","Now my system is whisper quiet, the fan hardly ever comes on, and the system runs ice cold.I am not sure who was responsible for shipping an unsuitable OS initially (CC or HP), but cudos to HP for eventually getting the OS right and for standing by their products when the motherboard began to show some serious issues out of warranty.","Don\u0027t believe me, look on all the tech boards or search Google under heat or fan troubles for the 2700 Presario - there are 100\u0027s of complaints, yet NO ONE will stand up to the plate...Yes, the 2701 gives you much bang for the buck - but if you can\u0027t get anyone to work on it and/or it costs you more than it\u0027s worth, Whats the point???? Go buy a high-end Toshiba or IBM....","The fan only comes on when doing CPU intensive tasks.","Fan is noisy, fingerprint reader is not really accurate (swipe swipe swipe)..","DVD Playback is fine but you definetely can\u0027t watch an international movie (2.30 hrs) in a battery.Lastly I find this laptop to be producing maximum heat near the fans.","If you\u0027re set on this one - get it refurbished, so it\u0027s got the latest firmware version that fixes the fan problem (or just update as soon as you get it) This is a fast notebook with a lot of powerful multimedia capabilities, I bought mine about 1.5 years ago and loved it, but over the years (year), it has not held up.","It did eat up my battery and put the fans to work, but that was expected.","The fan runs constantly, and is quite loud.","Now with both of these issues fixed, this laptop continues to serve me well and is very livable with the normal fan speed.","Laptop magazine has given this a \u0027best buy\u0027, and i agree.Some things to note:The little keyboard may prove a problem for someone with big hands, as some of the keys are shrunk for space.The battery life isnt up to par, it lasts only about two hours, not the three as advertised, so i\u0027ll be asking for a second come christmas.it can get a bit warmer than i expected it to, but thats of small matter in the big picture, if you keep in mind to put a coaster or something simple under it to give the fan a bit more space to work with, its realy no incovenience.You wont regret this purchase and you\u0027ll save a good $100 in the end... good on averatec.","It is in repairs and being repaired since 2.2.2006 with the same problem for 6 times now.This laptop has 4th hard drive, 3rd motherboard, 2nd graphic card, 2nd cooling fans and who knows what else.","I expect this is true for many small laptops, but from what I have experienced, this one needs a larger fan.","This is a good thing and a bad thing, without the fans there would be internal damage due to heat, but the fans are really loud.","In 1999 I bought a VAIO desktop Digital Studio Desktop (455Mhz) , and it never let me down, actually we are still using it now at home.The laptop, when at home isconnected to a Sony DCR-TRV310 Digital 8 camera via ilink, a Sony DRX-510UL USB and Ilink DVD+-RW/+-R, and a western digital WD1200B007 external Hard disk.With 3 USB ports, a Ilink , 2 PCMCIA and Memory stick , compostive video out, audio out this laptop is great for multimedia.Three sore points :-There is no built in Microphone, just a mic input-Finding a connector to hook up the Component video directly to TV is something I am still pursuiing.- As a real road warrior, I carry this laptop in a roller due to its weight.Battery is acceptable, but not extraordinary.I could not find a docking station, which would have come handy.I use a laptop stand/Lap platform to prevent heating problems, as the main fan outlet is underneath.The Keyboard is a real natural.","After reading all the reviews with compliants about heat and fan noise, I made a second pilgrimage to see one in person again.","Let me tell you, as soon as you get any kind of processes going, it bumps up to 2GHz, boy does the fan start to spin and make a noise like a jet airplane.","I have to keep a fan on this constantly to keep it functioning without slowing down.","The fan runs constantly, and it is the loudest fan you have ever heard in your life.","There is a fan that turns on once in a while to cool the computers.","It is so quiet that when the fan is on, its hardly noticeable.","I wanted to update my review to notify everyone that firmware update was released in 02/09 that fixes the annoying fan issue stated above.","These included a free download of a smc fan control that starts the fan at lower temperatures you set (the fan doesn\u0027t seem to be noisey until the computer gets really hot) I also tried an x-pad (xpad4laptop.com) and it did drop the temperature without external fans (another optional fix).","Here comes the tricky part - the Power Setting for AMD process is rather wieird.Here is my recommandation for Power Setting* When you use your laptop with AC power, set it to \"Laptop/notebook\"* When you use your laptop without AC power set it to \"Desktop/office\" mode(find this from Power Option in Control Pannel in Windows)By doing this you can save battery life by minimizing CPU voltage use and FAN use.I tried other setting and it uses battery faster.","Downsides are that the cooling fan is very noisy, and it is HEAVY.","But it is worth...You will love it, just as I am with mine now...Always on the road..:-) I read the comment about the fan noise this computer has, but I didn\u0027t care and bought this computer anyway.","The problems began to grow worse with time:- Hotter running.- Noisier fan, as a consequence.- The wireless network interface would randomly shut off (i\u0027ve read this happens to the miniPCI Intel wireless card used in this and a few other machines - an update from Microsoft temporarily relieved the problem, but it started up again).- The web cam was invisible to Vista in all ways except being listed in the device manager as \"working properly.\"","May be Toshiba should supply some earplugs with this model! Fan noise is killing me on this laptop.","only then the fan ran a lot more.","I think i got a defective peice and luckily before one month only i could find out that otherwise i wouldn\u0027t have got my entire refund.Now i am about to recieve my refund as of Nov 2nd.I dont recommend this product as i was very big fan of Sony Viao and thinking that it will last for more time but for my it was very big disappointment.I have 2 dell laptops and i wanted one more for my brother so i ordered one more dell.","I don\u0027t see this as a big deal, b/c it does have a fan to keep the system stable.","If this is what you have to have, then go for it, but be conscientious of possible defects on the LCD and a loud fan.","When the fan comes on in mine it is a very quiet hum, in no way distracting or annoying.","Also the fan is pretty loud so if you manage to hear what you are listening to, the fan pretty much drones it out.I really do like my computer, I really never have any problems with dead pixels or freezing, and even though I had to mail them my computer, Averatecs customer support staff has always been very helpful.","The fan is always on, even on idle.","The fan isn\u0027t noisy and mobile Athlon is great!Battery life is in excess of 3 hrs and laptop doesn\u0027t get hot either.","(The fan would stop itself if it kept grinding against the casing) I bought a replacement fan, installed it myself, and the cooling system has given me no problems since.After about 18 months, the hinge connecting the display to the main board became extremely wobbly and loose.","I just got this laptop today and the first thing I noticed is how ridiculously loud the fan is.","It always got hot when doing basic stuff, thus the fan kicks into overtime to cool it down causing noticeable noise.","Upon reading some of these reviews I had to speak up and this is coming from an advanced knowledge computer user AND someone who can truly speak from experience about the computer itself and it\u0027s performance...I used to be a HUGE fan of Toshibas until I tried this out, and I also used to have a new laptop EVERY six months since I always liked to have the latest and greatest.","11) Exhaust fans (2 fans) are located at the bottom of the machine and may be blocked if laptop is not placed on a rigid and flat surface when machine is on.","Consider adding at least another 256.- internal fan is sometime annoying when you do heavy graphics/calculation.","There are 3 fans on the bottom and a huge heat sink in the back.I would have liked to see a separate keypad since Toshiba had the room to put one in, but the overall feel of the full-size keyboard is good.","I installed SmcFanControl to be able to monitor the internal temperatures and can adjust the fan speed in case it runs a little hot.","The os itself is realy awsome however unfortionently the hardware doesnt seem that great because this new system of apple\u0027s seems to be plagued by all sorts of problems namely moo or constant noise from the fan motors reving up and down constantly as well as a wine noise coming from the cpu which i hear is artributed to a problem with the logic board.","The loud fan is almost always on and interferes with audio and recording.","The fan is a little loud, but that is the case for all thin and lights.Great notebook for the price.","I found after sending it out to get serviced that the CPU fan went bad and when it overheated, it shut down.","Had it for a week ,always overheated ,the cooling fan never functioned correctly.","Nor have I experienced any of the other negative things that others have mentioned about in their reviews (i.e. noisy fans after a year, dead batteries, screen cracks, pixel drops, etc.)Get this laptop if you really don\u0027t like the idea of having to lug around a behemoth of a regular laptop.","If the little fan bothers you you can set it from the power panel to where the fan is off all the time - but bare in mind that if it gets hot then the processor speed drops automatically.14.","So ok.. system working fine.. decided to buy a fan system to put the laptop on it to keep it cool.","As everyone has pointed out, the battery life is practically nil, the fan is noisy, and to top it off, in the last year and 1/2, I\u0027ve had to replace the battery and the hard disc.","The fan was a little noisy, but I calibrated it, and now it\u0027s fine.","The fan is noisy, but not too noisy.","This laptop is SILENT, except when you\u0027re running some resource-intensive application that will make the fan run a bit faster.Connectors: The power, network, firewire, modem, one USB 2.0, and PCMCIA is on the left side.","So, guess its up to you, if your an apple fan, and already familiar this is a great product, and for those of us who havent a clue about the apple software etc..this is a real pain to convert.","My experience:- Noisy Fan \u0026lt;--- TRUE, but it is not too bad.- Laptop runs HOT HOT HOT! \u0026lt;--- NOT TOO HOT- Periodically shuts down without warning due to overheating \u0026lt;--- NEVER HAPPENED TO ME- The batter life is abysmal \u0026lt;--- NOT IN MY CASE- Very weighty \u0026 big \u0026lt;--- TRUE- Poor placement of cooling fan; if you try to use the laptop on your lap, you often block the cooling fan causing a crash due to heat \u0026lt;--- NOT TRUE, the colling fan is on the left side.- Screen: if you have something really bright or really dark on the screen, you can sometimes see dark lines running up the screen from the light/dark area.","In this regard, I highly recommend a cooling pad with built-in fans, such as the \"Bytecc cooling pad\" I\u0027m currently using.","As for the fan noise, it is non-existent.","I am a support technician for PC\u0027s so I know this is the status quo these days but I found their software packages particularly cluttered.But that was a problem that can be overcome, the fan noise was not.","Between the small 100GB drive, random loss of networking and the RATTLING and VIBRATING fan, i desperately disassembled the unit to clean the fan and install a new hard drive.Laptops are not meant to be serviced.","Even with the fan running constantly the computer is still quite hot.","The fan sounds like a runaway locomotive.","Apparently they use substandard thermal compound that can\u0027t handle the heat this thing puts out.LOUD fan when running at 100% CPUGets very warm under wristsOnly 2 hours of battery life.","It was one of the most expensive models and I only used it lightly during the one and half year.Now, the fan had exactly the same problem as posted by by [Laptop Professional \"Anonymous Owner\"], --- it became noisy for two weeks and then died.","I\u0027d like to find a way to lubricate the fan and see if that helps, but it seems to be a closed unit.Toshiba sure doesn\u0027t make it easy to repair this unit, with almost no resources online for the overheating and fan problems that seem to be endemic to this computer, and it seems that it often needs some major repairs, particularly to the cooling.","I actually own it for the last 18 months and the fan is vary noisy I added 1GB of RAM (to 2GB) before even booting up out of the box, which I regret now, just for curiosity reasons, but so far I am very pleased with the twin-core MT6840.","I guess there isn\u0027t much Apple can do about it, maybe use faster fans or something, but as they are the fans are pretty quiet, where as, to bring up the Gateway, the fans on that thing are really intrusively loud, although it does stay a lot cooler.Everything else is great.","Here\u0027s a run down:- Very Noisy Fan- Laptop runs HOT HOT HOT! even in a A/C room- Periodically shuts down without warning due to overheating(They are currently being sued by class action on several laptop models, with more coming!)- The batter life is abysmal (less than 60 minutes)- Very weighty \u0026 big- Poor placement of cooling fan; if you try to use the laptop on your lap, you often block the cooling fan causing a crash due to heat- Screen: if you have something really bright or really dark on the screen, you can sometimes see dark lines running up the screen from the light/dark area.- Awful power managment; 90% of the time the battery dies w/out any warning to plug in- WORST TECH SUPPORT EVER!!! We bought the 36 hour guaranteed turn around support.","However, I believe that Acer has a serious problem with their fans.","The fan turned on during the conversion, but shut down shortly after that, as different graphic engine was used.Of course, the screen is beautiful.","The design of the machine means that all dust, hair, dirt etc. gets sucked into the machine, clogs the fan and the heat sinks and increases heat and causes cooling problems.","touchpad\u0027s nice, sounds are nice too. and unlike what the other dude said, the fans are quiet unlike those vaio and satellite laptops.","The fan only comes on once in a while, and when it does, it only for a short time.The 200 gig hard drive is great to have.","I have since put it on a raised metal grid with a 3\" fan underneath and no problems! I have had it running for 12 hours and more for the last year and it works perfectly!I bought a USB wireless adapter which gives connectivity of 54 Mbps, so that solves the network card issue.I tried some of the Vista laptops and this seems to be faster! It looks like I\u0027ll be keeping it longer now that I know what makes it work! The laptop coolers they sell will help, but just by putting it on a raised metal grid keeps it fairly cool.","To fix that I set the PM to minimal, which helped; I also bought a Targus Chiller Pad to keep the computer cooler; it overheats, and its bottom vent fan isn\u0027t adequate; with the chiller pad, it works much better.The biggest problem I\u0027ve encountered with the 3225 happened over the past week.","It\u0027s larger than my 3 previous Sony Vaio laptops, the edges are squared off, not rounded...in fact there\u0027s something very \u0026quot;square\u0026quot; about the entire product design!The design is bad enough to hurt functionality, too, as there is a fan on the bottom of the computer which easily becomes obstructed if you use it outside of the docking case (where 100% of my use occurs).Now about quality.","This laptop is alot quieter than my HP (fans) and the heat is kept at a minimum (so no sweaty lap).","Thankfully I purchased a 3 year warranty because I used it up! Two power adapters, two displays, and a cooling fan replaced.","The fan runs non-stop.","After about 6 months I noticed mass amounts of heat emitting from this laptop to dangerous levels, it could burn your hand!!! Fan runs non stop for some reason and it required external cooling espessially when runnning VISTA which this unit has major trouble handleing.","Fan is a bit noisy, and the laptop freezes whenever it feels like after hibernation.","I have always been a fan of Lance Armstrong, and it influenced my decision to buy this notebook.Even though this notebook has a graphic cards that shares the memory with the system, the performance of Radeon XPress 200 is adequate for the many 3D graphics.","However, it has always run on the hot side, and for the past 6 months the fan has been extremely noisy.","Even when I keep it on my lap, it\u0027s not uncomfortable -- just stay away from that fan exhaust! You\u0027ll break a sweat.-The maximum resolution is 1024x768.","CPU fan stopped working2.","Mine came back with a defective fan.","Next project is replacing the fan.","I am wondering if the people with the overheating problem have ever popped the cover off and cleaned the fan and heatsink? Probably takes 10 minutes.I paid well under $500 for it 4 years ago brand new, and couldn\u0027t have been happier with the purchase.","it\u0027s so loud that once it started, you just wish you got ear plugs at hand, and3) almost any program activated to work, it\u0027d kick start the fan; and once the fan started, it\u0027d take years to stop; and once the fan started, your mouse would freeze up.","Much faster processor too.Internally the MBP 13 uses 1 fan and a small speaker attached to the main board.","Intel\u0027s speedstep (or AMDs similar technique) is needed to reduce power consumption/dissipation (and hence heat) to keep the fan off.","My screen got a crack which I believe was due to the warping of the frame around the screen related to the excessive heat caused by the fan problem.I wrote to Sony and they would do nothing for me regarding the cracked screen due to the overheating frame.","It\u0027s easily transported in my backpack, and doesn\u0027t make any sound when I\u0027m in class (the fan is very quiet).","(I am a fan of ATI graphics cards because they have been quite reliable over the long haul and because upgrading them from ATI\u0027s nice website is a snap.","The only time that the ibook makes a sound is when a disc is inserted and the very quiet fan comes on only after a while of playing Age of Empires 2.4) Screen size and resolution: The Compaq did have a better resolution of 1400 by 1050 compared to the ibook\u0027s 1024 by 768 but I have not really cared since the ibook\u0027s resolution is what I would normally use on the Compaq anyways.","The bottom of the laptom does get a little hot and the fan is a little louder than other lap tops but you get use to it and it doesn\u0027t hinder me from my work.","for such an outdated cpu (t7300), its very snappy and does the normal surfy, streamy things just dandy.i put a solid state h.d. in mine and i recommend them for a little more speed.excellent keyboard and decent display and right now the cpu cores are running at...35c and 39c and the fan isn\u0027t even running.","Also, the fan of the nc8230 runs quietly.","And the BIOS is phoenix bios, which is not supported by most of the BIOS tweak tools that you can run from windows.The cooling fan does make a lot of noise at times, but I have come to get used to that and unfortunately, you cannot control the fan speed through the power management tool (unlike the case in some other models).The display is really good with high resolution.","You rarely hear the sound of the internal fan.","Even so, I just finished installing Windows XP MCE using Apple\u0027s boot camp, mostly just because I\u0027m a big Flight Simulator fan.","If you are a Sony fan, other Vaio models would be fine.If you still want this one, consider following accessories:1.","It works well, runs kind of hot and the fan is moderately loud (what do you expect with a half inch thick laptop), and otherwise works and looks like the day I bought it.","(I am a fan of ATI graphics cards because they have been quite reliable over the long haul and because upgrading them from ATI\u0027s nice website is a snap.","My first was a $2200 HP \u0027desktop replacement\u0027 that was a killer machine, but extremely heavy, very loud fan, and a full 45 minutes of battery life.","The fan is a bit loud but not distracting.","Then in the Windows Control Panel Power Setting adjust the setting to Max Battery to lower the CPU voltage while plugged AND unplugged, thus kicking in the fan less frequently.","My 3 biggest issues with this laptop are: (1) noisy fan, (2) no good port replicator/docking station \u0026 (3) no auto/air adapter.","I think it would be SO MUCH better to have the fan on the side and all the ports on the very back.","Did not stress test the system yet.The Good:1) Screen quality (compared to many other laptops).2) Build quality, looks - SOLID3) Comes with Wireless - N.4) Intel\u0027s Newer Graphics chipset, better for Vista Aero.5) My old sony used to have fan noise.","You can go to any Target and purchase a platform that has two little fans in it.","They\u0027re on opposite sides now (because you can add two batteries or two drives, if you like).The ONLY foreseeable problem is that there are THREE heat fans on the bottom.","If you are an apple fan, no hesitation, buy it.","It is a great priced notebook except few things.It heats up at the bottom, the fan is at the bottom, therefore you have to place something under it, coolpad will be the best.The keyboard is difficult to adjust, number keys are very small, deletion is at the top right, Shift is at very far right therefore every time I press up arrow.","Let me get this out of the way first, the fan is not an issue and can be controlled through VAIO Power Management.","You can hear the fan if you take your ear next to it - but very quiet otherwise.Cons:1.","I got the one with two fans that sits right under the back of the computer, and I can use it for very extended periods of time without overheating.So, I can play games, video and photo edit, and use this for school and entertainment purposes and I love it.","Lasted around 2.5 hours.(normal life, I would presume)Screen is too bright at times (see review on crkt cty), and one needs to constantly move it to adjust to right view.Also, the DVD was a little sketchy when one moves the mouse over(as if there were scratches), and also, audio would be distorted if one attempted to open some other application.(For eg, I ran the WinXP tour)Other than these small grouses, it looks awesome, there\u0027s absolutely no noise from the fan at all.","this computer is so slow.the screen freezes every 10 days so when it freezes i have to take out the battery.this crap wastes all my time.when installing 1 simple program it takes at least 10-20 minutes for the program to be instaled.i had to fix this computer twice in the last month.another big problem is the overheating.the 1st day i got the computer it started heating up so rapidly i could not stop it.now i have to carry a portable fan where ever i go so it does not overheat.every time you have a 50 50 percent chance of having internet connection.it takes a long time to load a page on the web and it takes a long time load programs and send mail.im a macintosh kind of guy.","Purchase this notebook and you will not be disappointed! I have been a fan of the VAIO since Sony released the first 16.1\" UXGA laptop.","My MacBookPro 15\" shuts down at random - seemingly when it gets too hot and right before the fans should probably have kicked in.","The design of the machine means that all dust, hair, dirt etc. gets sucked into the machine, clogs the fan and the heat sinks and increases heat and causes cooling problems.","Now that is unique! I plug it into the little keypad USB port and the fan is positioned on a flexible, positionable rod and provides enough air circulation to keep me comfortable but doesn\u0027t blow my paper around the office.","The keyboard is quiet and the fan is quiet.","AIM and MSN Messenger would use it, but NONE of Vista\u0027s features would, though XP had handled it beautifully.- The fan started rattling.","The cooling fans are below and if the laptop is placed on a cushion surface it heats up like hell and shuts down.","I had to re-coat the cpu with thermal compound, and clean out the fan housing and cooling fins last year.","The dvd drive is a excellent feature and more of a added bonus but the cd burner is an awsome little burner and usful for on the spot recording (I\u0027m a broadcast student).The bundle software I am never a big fan of but it does include some very handy software such as money 2003,Intervideo 2004 and Works those just a few but the ones I use the most.The techincal support is the best support team out there they will speak english to you instead of computer lingo and will accaully be nice when the costumer is getting upset.I have use Sony\u0027s tech support on and off for the last three years and they truely know how to treat their costumers with kindness.I would say comparing to the computers I have used in my life (Hewitt Packard,Dell and Gateway) you are getting more for the money when you purchase a Sony Vaio.","I called Sony\u0027s Service Center, they told me that alot of customers have called them complaining about the fan problem and a investigation is underway, but I am so pissed off right now because this product has a blatantly defective fan and Sony has failed to pull it out of the market.Honestly, the fan makes so MUCH noise that this computer is not even worth buying.","The fan is a little louder than other notebooks, but I can not think of anything else that could bother even the most particular person.","The fan is quiet.","If it is on AC power there is NOTHING you can do to make the fan shut up (short of a bat).","Of course, the fan does speed up every once in a while when necessary.There is, however, one very poor aspect of the laptop.","However it\u0027s lack of an internal fan leads to overheating which I am sure is contributing to the poor performance--including the need to replace the hard drive after less than 6 months of light home use by my wife.","The computer has a tendency to run hot and when the fan kicks it, it\u0027s quite noisy.","It works fine, but my two complaints are the fan noisy and the ram (2x512 sticks rather than 1GB stick, makes expansion wasteful/more costly).","AIM and MSN Messenger would use it, but NONE of Vista\u0027s features would, though XP had handled it beautifully.- The fan started rattling.","So you constantly have a fan turning off and on, off and on, off and on.","And best part is no fan/CPU noiseNegative point: From sides it looks bit bulkyThis was a great deal compared to Sony Lenovo or Dell.","I\u0027m going to return mine ... this unit locks up regularly due to overheating problems...The bios upgrade didn\u0027t fix anything... leaving a desktop fan blowing over the unit does.Also the battery life is horrible... under 2 hours for regular use.Nice speakers and seems fast enough when running.","\"Do not block the fans\" they say.","I am not a fan of touchpads, but the one on the Satellite works particularly well, allowing me to forgo my cordless mouse on a cramped airplane tray table.Neither the Celeron CPU nor the nVidia graphics on board this unit will be suitable for graphics-heavy work or games--it\u0027s a bit underpowered for these applications.If the Satellite only had a better battery, I\u0027d rate this a top-class road warrior.","9) Does not accept Compact flash cards directly (Accepts a number of other memory cards) 10) Fans are noisy and you really notice how quite it gets when you shut down the machine.","before the fan stopped, you just couldn\u0027t do anything but to wait out (and life is too short, don\u0027t you think so?}4) once the fan started, the heat exhausted from the laptop always mingled with some weird smell, like burning plastic or that smell is from the protective wrapping material around the hard drive? and why it\u0027s so hot? just because panasonic did an unique job to protect the hard drive from damage if dropped accidently from a 4-feet height? and why it\u0027s so hot? why the fan almost has to kick started so often, so randomly and so long? is it because panasonic wrappd more protective material under the keyboard from water damage? yeah, it maybe very tough, but it\u0027s also too hot to put on you lap or keep the fan quiet and not over worked.5) the screen.","The cooling fan is extra quiet you can\u0027t even tell it is running, the cd/dvd player on the other hand you can hear when it\u0027s loading.","Even the highest fan speed does not make annoying noise (very quite).Durability: Definetely a Sony high quality item.Battery life: It is not good as other computers, because of 17inch screen.","The presario 700 is a very good PC for business and home use but with two problems so far I relise that when I am playing games or running 3D programmes the PC freezes up.ALso Over heating is a big problem you need a portable fan at all times, the bois programme is not helping at all.Also the battery life is to short.I think compaq should try tp fix this problem or they will lose customers like me and on the other hand I am also returning this laptop.","It lets me focus on my work, rather than get distracted and annoyed at the grinding noise from the fan and hard drive.4.","The fans get louder from time to time just for a few seconds, which is normal.- The overall design is excellent but be carefull with the QuickPlay buttons.","I\u0027ve been a Vaio fan for yrs and am just thrilled with this model.","Especially about the heat and fan issues.","It\u0027s great for the TYPICAL user...but don\u0027t buy this laptop and then complain that you can\u0027t run your huge graphic-demanding games on it without giving up some quality...if you\u0027re in that boat, you should go with an Alienware.Some annoyances that have been listed with this laptop, other than battery life which I have already covered, are the keyboard and some complaints of overheating or loud fan noise.","the fan is kinda loud but it does not have an annoying sound to it at all.","somes times a week without it, or maybe 3 in a day, i also encounter the blue screen of death a lot...(the microsoft crash) which SHOULD be very rare on an XP machine.the keyboard layout is nice, when you get it it takes alittle time to get used to, but i type just as fast on this as a normal keyboard.there are 2 usb ports, they are on the right side of the laptop so it makes using a mouse very akward.This laptop is SO powerful and small, so its only natural that it would get hot, and when it gets hot the fan goes on...overall its average... but for the price i\u0027d go withsomething else I have used this machine for a month now and am fairly satisfied with the overall performance.","I think the fan wasnt working properly.","I am a big sports fans and I like Canadian Football.","A few GB saved doesn\u0027t matter much in a desktop, but when you are limited to 120GB, every little bit matters.Despite the hype I\u0027m not a big fan of OS X, so I\u0027m primarily running Windows XP using Apple\u0027s Boot Camp product, which allows just that.","Parts replaced include the keyboard ($20/ part) twice, battery ($30) once, and fan ($20/ part) once.","The built-in speakers are very good indeed and well located.- The CPU fan is somehow more silent specially when controlled by the Toshiba Power Saving Modes.- Haven\u0027t tested the rest of the peripherals like DVD/CDRW but they seem to be of standard quality.Cons:- Misleading specs, Toshiba claims to include an Intel Celeron M 2.8Ghz CPU when in fact this is a your average OEM desktop CPU, Integrated 32MB VRAM video card is another wrong specs about this system since the Intel 852GME is an IGP that uses/shared system memory and allocates 16MB when you have 256MB or 32MB when 512MB is installed, these settings can\u0027t be changed by the user.- Heavy an bulky, another specs blunder by Toshiba on the A45 line, it\u0027s as thick as the 2199US on the front(1.6\") but the back is almost 2.5\" thick, also the sides are around 1/2\" - 3/4\" bigger than the 2199US.","so its a balancing act when the fans are on.","I\u0027m also not a fan of the new mouse pad page scroller.","But seriously I dont hear the fan unless Im in a COMPLETELY silent room and the CPU is running at 100%, I might here it BARELY.","Whiney fan, TERRIBLE battery life, ugly, cheap paint, tiny keyboard... i could go on and on.","So if you\u0027re scrolling on Googlemaps, each time you grab the map and scroll anywhere the fan will do a little wooooooh sound.","Battery power lasts for 2:15 hours and the keyboard is rickety and cheap.Performance is OK, but nothing like I expected it and the fan is very loud.","great- Card Reader - Although limited, still great- Carbon Fiber Casing - Very sturdy- Excellent ports and connections for size- Stays cool - Quiet fan when it heats up, doesn\u0027t ever get too hot that it become uncomfortable- Bluetooth/Wi-FiCONS:- Expensive - Perfection comes at a price- Not as thin as expected - Kind of a thick case for the screen size, not as thin as the MacBookI almost advise going to SonyStyle.com just so you can configure the 2.0GHz processor, but other than that, if they price is irking you, Sony has an outlet store online, and they offer this and many other laptops with 1 year waranties if it\u0027s refurbished.","a memory of 160 G with 40 G of installation for Vista is too much!a little noise from fan, really nasty for a 2000$ computer Am I ever glad I purchased this Macbook Pro from the Macbook Pro series.","It just feels that Vista is a resource hog and is constantly running the CPU at 100% which causes the fan to run endlessly.","Together with a regular vaccuming of the actual laptop fan to suck out any dust I haven\u0027t had a problem since then.","I have occasional problems with the included BlueTooth mouse, but only on startup while the BlueTooth is initializing.I\u0027m not a big fan of included software and mercifully this system doesn\u0027t include much.","These things happen and just because you messed up doesn\u0027t mean it had to do with the hardware.To the person who doesn\u0027t think sony makes good cd/dvd-rw\u0027s, yes, they do, I have 2 sony CD/DVD-RW drives, and 1 CD-RW drive, and they all work FINE.This laptop is more powerfull then most people I know, and it\u0027s not even overclocked, it\u0027s got a big hard drive and alot of ram, not to mention DV video imput.The bad side to this laptop, is that sence the proccessor speed is so high, the fan is basicly constantly on, but woopde friggindo, buy a silent one from tigerdirect.com and your set.","I know it will be unpopular with Mac fans but hope it helps you XP users make the right decision.iBook pro\u0027s,1.","That display had to be replaced.- The fan failed after about 12 months and had to be replaced because the overheating was so intense, the Thinkpad would simply \u0027black screen\u0027 - just turn itself off without warning.- The initial battery had to be replaced after about 6 months because the initial 90 minutes or so quickly degraded to about 45.","Good news: you don\u0027t need to completely disassemble the laptop to get at the hard-drive or optical-drive.Annoying news: the ram is located under the keyboard, the removal of which is tricky.Bad news: complete disassembly is required to replace an ailing cooling fan, the machine has lots of hidden plastic tabs holding it together, and take-apart guides are very hard to find.","If it is on AC power there is NOTHING you can do to make the fan shut up (short of a bat).","To add to the confusion on the USB ports, mine says USB 2.0 and I was able to transfer videos (1 minute to transfer for a 1-minute video clip) from my Mini-DV camera to the laptop through the USB.The fan switches on and off periodically.","The MBP\u0027s fans also default to a low 2000rpm and rarely step over that mark in OS X, which isn\u0027t feasible under Windows.OS X greatly simplifies computing, in addition to making it more reliable.","If they had a more durable hard disks in them I would rate this product five stars, but until then, three stars is all I have to offer.The only other problem I had with this computer was with it overheating, the fan only comes on when it\u0027s really working hard and there is no way to change that (as far as I know).","The computer will then calculate the proper speed of the fan based on what you\u0027re using it for at the time.","The fan does run alot but I hardly notice it, but it does push alot of heat out of the unit.","As others noted, the fan rarely turns off and is as loud as a leaf blower (I can\u0027t take a nap with laptop on).","However, one or two years later, you will notice the Dell is getting up and running slower, the fan is making louder noise, and the bottom is getting extremely hot.","I had to replace the fan when it was 3 years old because it was making horrible noises and when it got hot it sounded like it was coughing occasionally.","The S Series has too many cons including heat dissipation and the fan noise.","The fan occasionally makes little, but hey , all laptops have some or the other issues these days.....","Everyone rates this machine bad because it runs hot and the fan is annoying.The reviews from consumers were quite distasteful in my mouth and I almost wanted to cancel my order for the Vaio.","The only gripe I have is the fan.","A fully charged battery lasts me about 3.5 hours in the energy efficient/silent mode.I have no complaints, other than the fans being a bit louder than I\u0027d like.","The series has chronic cooling fan problems.","The fan was pristine and clean, the machine was reassembled (albeit missing a ribbon connection, which i fixed after disassembling it again), but the fan runs FULL SPEED constantly.","Based on the other reviews below, I hope Sony gets better providing customer service...they have some innovative products but appear to be weak in after sales support...i am still a fan of the brand.","It is virtually silent, unless the fan is briefly running.","I can only use my laptop in a cold room with a big external fan blowing on it.","I didn\u0027t care much about that and in order to avoid this problem I used it in power saver mode, so the fan was less noisy.","The fan/heat output on the right side is present, but has never presented the slightest of problems...I really can\u0027t imagine what some are complaining about...that heat needs to go somewhere - outside of the case - it\u0027s not like the Pentium M or other components are elctronically inefficent relatively speaking.","The overheating problem was never fixed even though after I sent to Toshiba repair.Major problem 2 is laptop screen messes up most of the times and screen will be with colors and lines dancing which was never fixed even though after I sent to Toshiba repair.TOSHIBA SERVICE AND SUPPORT STINKSSo if you buy this and if you have any problems take the laptop personally to the local service center and get it fixed.The other problem that I have is this fan makes a very loud noice all of a sudden and then its back to normal...I think it is so annoying.IT IS BETTER NOT TO BUY ANY TOSHIBA PRODUCTS.","be prepared to hear the fan turn on unless you\u0027re working in a very cool room.","I have always liked Toshiba but after wasting so much money on one I will never get another.Pro\u0027s- Very nice looking machine loaded with features, nice sound (for a laptop), and very clear and bright screen.Cons- noisy fan, runs hot which probably contributed to the short lifespan .Power supply also gets very hot.Toshiba mobile services NZ wanted to charge me $1500.00 for a replacement motherboard and provide just a three month warranty on the repair.","I thought maybe it just needed cleaning, but finally one computer guy said it needed a new fan.","Many of my friends are mac fans, and I have made fun of them for years.","The computer gets too hot and it does have a noisey fan.","The CPU gets used 100% all the time and as the result the fan keeps running all the time and a ton of heat produced.","Although based on specs and tech yammer it is not up to scratch I can think of few things that I can\u0027t do with this smart looking machine.Even though it isn;t a G4 it runs ichat with no problem and basically does everything that my imac does..without the fan noise.","Sure the fan is a little loud, but this computer will never die.","However, the fan noise is very loud.","That lowers the fan\u0027s speed and noise.","And when you try to find that other program, you hit the wall.Now after a month, it is still light and still looking nice, still overheats, fan does not stop, hard drive grinds something God knows what, and the webcam is still being used by another application.I have had it with it and with Toshiba, I can return it, so I will as soon as I get another one, probably the Dell XPS.","Also the fan I never noticed until I read the reviews....I love the fact the s460 is so light and easy to move around.","I\u0027ve been a fan of Apple for about three years ago, ever since I was introduced to them by the flat panel iMac.","You can manage the fan intensity through the software.","Many of the complaints listed are valid, like the short battery life and noisy fan.","Here comes the tricky part - the Power Setting for AMD process is rather wieird.Here is my recommandation for Power Setting* When you use your laptop with AC power, set it to \"Laptop/notebook\"* When you use your laptop without AC power set it to \"Desktop/office\" mode(find this from Power Option in Control Pannel in Windows)By doing this you can save battery life by minimizing CPU voltage use and FAN use.I tried other setting and it uses battery faster.","If I continue to work, without minding the heat generated from the bottom of the laptop, then the Fan kicks in and makes it noisy enough to wake up my neighbors.","It crashes, freezes, takes forever to load pages, can\u0027t interact with video or sound, etc.I used to be a big Mac fan, but they have totally lost the edge.","It is the coolest running of my notebooks because the cooling fan runs constantly.","USB 1.1 is more than 3 years old and notebook makers like CPQ/HP should keep up with the rest of the industry instead of pushing an outdated technology.- Intel Celeron 2.8Ghz, 256MB RAM \u0026 40GB 4200RPM HD, \"diehard\" fan of AMD may be suprise of this CPU with 128Kb cache and 240MB of system memory performs as well as the AMD XP-M. Boot up time and overall usage of the system is a little slower than the 2199US, but with 240MB left(16MB for Video) it does a good job even when playing games or opening several applications at once, probably will give credit to the Intel chipset here again.- Battery seems to last around 3Hrs with normal usage like surfing and word processing.- Video card has good performance, with only 16MB got an 1700 score with 3DMark01 @ 1024x768x32 almost the same as the ATI IGP on the 2199US.- Most people claim that the support and service from Toshiba is far superior than HP/CPQ, can\u0027t account for that since I only had these systems for a few hours.- Audio, volume control is on the right hand side and adjustable by hand, unlike the 2199US that is dificult to reach and works only under Windows.","Fan is barely inaudible if it is on, and doesn\u0027t burn the skin like other laptops I\u0027ve used.Cons1) Buttons for the touchpad are pretty small and hard to hit.","Like a lot of people I\u0027m a big fan of Apple products.","I\u0027ve always been a fan of IBM.","The cooling fans work well under normal circumstances and quietly, but surprisingly they do not kick into overdrive when the laptop gets unusually hot.","After twenty to thirty minutes of use in a room around 72F, the notebook has substantially heated up due to the lack of fans.","Very quiet fan compared to other models.","I had purchased a cheaper laptop earlier, but sent it back because of the fan noise.","I looked at this very model in several stores and NEVER heard the fan run.","Evidently the adhesive holding the unit together had tilted the rotor in one direction, so the fan\u0027s blades were grinding against the surrounding casing.","The fan was pristine and clean, the machine was reassembled (albeit missing a ribbon connection, which i fixed after disassembling it again), but the fan runs FULL SPEED constantly.","I purchased a notebook \"lift\" from Office Max which allows air to circulate beneath the machine - this keeps the machine cooler and the fans run less.The battery life is only about 2 hours so I usually move the power cord around with me if I\u0027m attempting to use the notebook as an actual \"laptop\" computer on my lap.","The fan runs more often than othersI think part of these problems because of the small form factor of this laptop.","When I opened it up (long after the warrantly expired, of course) there was a dust cake growing between the vent and fan.","Sony insisted to charge \u003e$250 to replace it because the warranty was just for one year.If you check Internet, you will find low quality fan is wide spread problem in Sony laptops.Be aware: Sony sells such low quality product at high price and then makes another round of profit by repairing it.","The only complaints I have are:The fan vent puts out a LOT of heat.","The only thing I could do to stop the overheating was to buy a small 6 inch fan with a clamp on it, clamp it to my desk, and point it directly at the rear of the laptop.This is poorly designed in my opinion.","I\u0027m very much a fan.","I also like the battery power indicator on the battery itself.So in the first 30 days I am admitting to being a big fan of the iBook and would recommend highly to those in the market for a sub $1500 laptop.","the processor fan is underneath the laptop so it can\u0027t take in any cool air to cool the processor.","Also, check out newegg dot com (sorry amazon), where you get a better price and the choice between TR2A, TR2AP1 (the latter comes with WinXP Pro, otherwise it\u0027s identical).The battery lifetime is good, in part due to power manager software, which turns down monitor brightness, regulates CPU / fan, shuts off optical devices (all options can be tuned as one so desires).The screen is crisp, however, I would not recommend working with it for many hours -- it\u0027s still rather small, and strains one\u0027s eyes a bit.Wireless is very sensitive.","The overheating is also affecting RAM (could not save a document one time and had to save it on to Google documents and re-start); and start-up (computer refused to start up several times one day) -- so it makes me think this is some sort of a heat issue -- faulty temperature sensor? faulty fan?? I do not know but I am not sure I will buy a second Mac to find out either.","I prefer that the fans are as quite as they are.","It is also very quiet--you don\u0027t hear fan noise like you might on other laptops.","The computer gets extremely hot and doesn\u0027t have a big enough fan to keep it cool so it shuts down on its own once and a while.","The fan placement is easy to block, which makes the laptop really hot if placed on a soft surface (couch, bed, etc).","I\u0027m not so concerned with the ram, since I don\u0027t require any high end processing, but with the fan, even though I use it mostly for browsing the web and watching videos online, the fan seems to turn on and off frequently (on 10-30 seconds, off for about a minute), after using it for a period of time (30 minutes to an hour).","Plus the cooling fans (at least three that I can account for) make a tremendous amount of noise, which is distracting in quiet office or meeting settings.The biggest strike against this laptop is its physical design.","A laptop shouldn\u0027t go to black screen the first day you get it! Perhaps it\u0027s overheating (even though I have a fan underneath), perhaps the brand has faulty components...I don\u0027t know.","Plus, I have been an AMD fan for a long time, so the notebook had to have an AMD in it.This notebook had everything I wanted, but what really set this one apart from the other notebook computers I was looking at, which was the biggest selling point, was the 10-key number pad.All in all, awesome notebook computer, the screen is a real beauty also.","I suggest everyone else do the same.Sony did replace my fan - (but it still overheats and is too hot for my lap - really, it burns me if I have on thin clothes, like pj\u0027s).The technician who came to my house (I live remote) told me that these computers had a lot of factory assembly problems.","The internal fan does kick in a lot, to cool down the system.","There are other problems with OS X in terms of design and practicality, and again, it hurts this old Apple fan to say that Microsoft\u0027s XP actually functions in a more friendly fashion in many respects (though IT does some downright psychotic things at times, which is what prompted me to buy the iBook in the first place.","I have research about this problem and noticed that a lot of users have similar problems or opposite problem with a fan that is always on full blush even if not needed.","It was one of the most expensive models and I only used it lightly during the one and half year.Now, the fan had exactly the same problem as posted by by [Laptop Professional \"Anonymous Owner\"], --- it became noisy for two weeks and then died.","Never any heat related problems.(note: use toothbrush to keep fan inlet clear)Battery died a few months back , probably from lack of use.( I always removed the battery for home use andstored the battery, fully charged)....","When it heats up after prolonged use the fan will kick in more often and make it a little louder.","As long as I have some background noise and am not working in total silence, it\u0027s livable.All in all, if you can find this notebook on sale it is a fantastic bargain if you can get around the few minor annoyances.*Update 10/12/09*I felt I should add to this review, seeing that when you search for the firmware/fan problem this page comes up.","Maybe all Core 2 Duo laptops will have fan noise? Intel\u0027s hot chips are ruining the world! (Exaggeration but...)Per other reviewers I did note that the keyboard was \"clacky\" and the battery did move slightly in its slot.","Most annoying, the fan is not constant and instead turns on and off every 10 seconds or so regardless of what you\u0027re doing.","with those powerful proformance and quality, it will heat up fast and need a strong fan to cool it down.","Another huge improvement is that the fan exhaust is now facing back instead of to the right so my mouse hand is not overheated while using the system.As with most laptops these days there are not serial or parallel ports, in this case even with the port replicator you are out of luck if you have a parallel printer.","To add insult to injury, despite packing it very carefully and inserting a note to please be careful, it returned with a big scratch on the lid.All of that would be forgivable if it wasn\u0027t for the most unbelievably annoying fan I have ever experienced.","It produces much less heat than my last one and hence less noise from the fan.","Laptops are cooled by thing, very crappy devices called heatpipes...they don\u0027t work very well, basically they just move the heat from once place to another (from the processor, to the outside where a fan is).","The laptop fan has died (I think) its shutting down by itself often and has lost critical data thrice this week.","I\u0027ve been a big fan of HP for years, so I hope you understand how disappointed I was when I bought my first L2000...What wasn\u0027t to like? 2GHz processor, 2MB of RAM, 100GB HDD, and a LightScribe drive-- I placed my order (from hpshopping.com) and eagerly awaited my new laptop.When it arrived, I spent 4 hours installing the software I need and configuring accounts, etc.","The system makes more fan noise than most other models.","After reading a few forums and finding out this was a common problem, it was suggested that the fan was clogged.","Missing keystrokes is just another matter.Another thing is Fan.","The fan is also particularly loud and annoying.","The fans do sometimes run at high speed, but normally they are pretty quiet.","It does get hot, and the fan does turn on frequently, but it\u0027s nothing unbearable.","Right now, I have it sitting four inches off the table and a little box fan blowing on it to cool it down and it still gets way too hot.","I\u0027m not much of a techie, but the overheating was, as I perceived it, a real problem and while shopping for laptops, salesmen might have thought I was insane for paying so much attention to the temperature / exhaust fans.","I\u0027ve been using my fan for more than a month now.","Martin is a long time PC fan.","But a cooling pad with fans takes care of that problem.","(Even after Amazon had sent a confirmation mail to me about my order.)Seems like some thing is fishy....Please be carefull while bying any stuff from here.RegardsAshok Hi all,I was very happy when I bought (from amazon.com) this but after few days I discovered it was making notice due to fan \u0026 never stops to takeoff heat.","The fan is in the back.","This cooler is perfectly suited to the Toshiba satellite.After placing the laptop on the cooler with the setting on high, the laptop fan stopped coming on and all freezing is gone.","Per the annoying fan; it turns on and off a lot but it\u0027s almost silent.Other reviewers criticized Sony marketing this notebook as a notebook verse a laptop.","As far as the fan problem the others mentioned, you can go to Compaq\u0027s website and download the KH.F.19 version of the BIOS which addresses the fan noise.","On the subject of ports, I am not a fan of the power cable.","I upped it to 2 MBs of RAM, got the 7200 RPM HD t and recommend that anyone do the same.It has been very reliable, runs so quiet I do not know it\u0027s even on unless a program either Safari or a lesser known writing tool Grammarian decides to hog the CPU, if the second fan comes on, then you hear it.","I have a new mini tower desktop (dual core Pentium) that sits 2 feet from me yet I can hear this laptop over it even though it is on a docking station at least 6 feet away.The only redeeming aspect is the fact that if you set it to max power saving mode and run it on the battery the fan will actually shut off - as long as you don\u0027t do anything more than simple word processing.","When gaming, the fan is loud and the laptop gets very hot.","It\u0027s easy to do, just follow the manual as before and it\u0027ll help keep the fan quite more.Overall, I love this PC.","Not hard drive or fan noise either.","IT DRIVES ME NUTS!!!!! If the fan wasn\u0027t so darn loud this would be my biggest gripe.Internal Speakers - I think they come with rocks inside.","Overheating is a problem because it gets too hot to keep on your lap and the fans turn on at full blast.If you\u0027re thinking of buying a Mac, buy it for the OS.","I have a wireless mouse, a cooling fan, a printer, two chargers and several jump drives that all run on USB ports.","It is also a very quiet unit, with the only sound being the occasional and brief action of the exhaust fan, and the hard disk (I do not notice the problem of \"clicking and stalling\" mentioned in another review).","The system runs hot on the bottom front left quadrant, but at least the fan discharges hot air out the side and not the back.","I would make sure you dont order one of the older models of the macbook pros and get the last model that came out you shouldnt have the problems then Greetings all, the other review by Sherrila Levin for this item is inappropriate and overzealous (I\u0027m a die-hard Mac fan).","If fan doesn\u0027t bother you I think this is probably the best 17\" laptop currently available.","I have a monitor for this thing and I use a cooling pad with it when it is on my desk, and I have a mini cooling fan that also tilts the computer at an angle more conducive to typing...so, overall, I only worry that it may shorten the life of the computer.2.","The Pentium 4 CPU requires that the fan run all the time at a very fast speed which means that it is VERY noisy.","Only way to get it to work well is if you set the fan speed for low but that decreases performance of the computer.K that was all the issues I have had with this computer, now here are a few good things.","Fan is noisy too.","The computer is able to automatically sense when it is getting too hot and will cool itself down thanks to a large fan in the rear of the computer chassis and CoolSense (ran for 8 hours with the lid shut) and it was warm, but it did not damage the machine.","i have had this laptop for 3 years now, and during the 1 year company warranty and 3 year with compusa, i had the WORST cooling problem...like the other users on this review forum, I had to ice the heat sinc in order to keep my laptop from shutting off abruptly (note folks that this is a security for your computer, if it continues to increase in temperature while it remains on, your hardware may be destroyed due to intense heat)...thus i had compusa replace the whole cooling system...it was a breeze and on a couple occasion had it it abruptly shut down on its own with the new cooling plates (for the new users without a warranty, the best way to maintain the cooling system is to blow straight into the exhaust while holding a damp cloth up to the fan screen, thus you will catch all the dust build-up)...also while i had my laptop hanging from my shoulder, my mustang door came swinging back at me knocking my laptop to the ground causing the hard driv to fail....this is typcial once excessive shock has been encountered...i simply had this replaced...for the next year and a half i had no problems and with all the things filed such as my library of 1500+ songs and music videos i still havnt filled up the lovely 60GB HDD...it is however as we call it today, a good desktop replacement according to its weight...its weight is on the rim btwn laptops that stay at home and laptops you can lug around at school...lately however iv been using a 3rd party ac adaptor and my ground needle snapped off...eventually i believe the temporary solder work i did to charge the unit caused the lcd backlight to short...after much research NOTE* even though your power jack supply is fused to the motherboard, you can have someone professionally un-solder that jack and replace it with another one at http://laptopjacks.com (which is about $25)...and if you can spot what has caused your backlight to go out like mine, (connections, lcd, bulb, etc) generailly it is bound to be the whole screen...all you need to do is go to a site like http://screentekinc.com and they will provide you a brand new screen (with available extra options like XBRITE in sync with the tech today)for roughly around $250 - $300 brand new...","As for the fan issue, it wasn\u0027t too bad.","In fact, I spent 3 hours writing yesterday evening and didn\u0027t notice any additional errors in my typing.I\u0027m not a fan of touchpads, though, so I added a USB Wireless mouse.","It\u0027s my first laptop and what a kick! I\u0027ve had two Mac desktop computers and have always been a big fan of Apple computers.","I have had to do this several times since then.It freezes constantly, the dvd/cd drive broke after only a year and the internal cooling fan is inadequate.","The dvd drive is a excellent feature and more of a added bonus but the cd burner is an awsome little burner and usful for on the spot recording (I\u0027m a broadcast student).The bundle software I am never a big fan of but it does include some very handy software such as money 2003,Intervideo 2004 and Works those are just a few but the ones I use the most.The techincal support is the best support team out there they will speak english to you instead of computer lingo and will accaully be nice when the custumer is getting upset.I have use Sony\u0027s tech support on and off for the last three years and they truely know how to treat their custumers with kindness.I would say comparing to the computers I have used in my life (Hewitt Packard,Dell and Gateway) you are getting more for the money when you purchase a Sony Vaio and you are buying quality.","Note that the hard drive died just after the warranty expired, as is typical with companies using very cheap hardware.The laptop also runs very hot, the fans are loud, battery life is about 1.5 hours, and the wireless is sketchy.","You get used to it in an instant, and everything else is, well, huge in comparison.And how quiet it is! I\u0027ve never been one to be bothered by the sound of computer fans--though the ones in my old desktop were outrageously loud and annoying--and thought my old laptop to have been quiet, but after using a PowerBook for two months, I know better.","They\u0027re lighter, quieter, cooler, and... slower.If the fan noise bothers you while working at home, try this: put the laptop inside a duffle bag, leaving plenty of room inside for ventilation.","In it, you can specify an internal temp at which the fan turns on, instead of HP\u0027s apparent belief that it doesn\u0027t need to come on until eggs are able to be fried on it.The screen is arguably the best I have used on ANY laptop, regardless of price range or manufacturer.","So, I guess I am a Compaq fan.","And I don\u0027t see the horizontal lines others have, maybe I just lucked out and got a good one.I am a fan of the latest PC laptops and their glossy screens, I hope Apple offers that as an option at some point.","I found out it is a common problem with the DV6000 series containing AMD chips.I sent it back to HP and they returned it in about 5 days and I thought everything was good....not so fast.They upgraded the bios to a version that makes the fan run at a slow speed non-stop (VERY ANNOYING) because the processor runs hot and kills the wireless adapter and system board.","However, playing it using the bundled InterVideo DVD was smooth and pleasant.Harman/Kardon speakers are great - though if you want any noticeable bass you have to hook it up to your stereo.I\u0027m a Linux fan so I also tried running the Ubuntu (Dapper) Live CD on the laptop - great first impression.","I have already had mine overheat and blow a harddrive, my disc drive, and my fan.","Not so with this model.Frankly, it is not much of a problem now, as I have not been listening to CDs for a while (thanks to iPods :), but back about 3 yrs ago I needed to burn music mixes on the CDs partly for my job and partly for my family, and it was a major problem, that I could not do it on this computer.2.The other, lot bigger and infinitely more annoying problem is the fan issue.From reading the reviews on other Toshiba laptops, this does not by far seem to be limited to just this particular model, but to other Toshibas as well.What I mean by that is the constant rapid outbursts, when the fan kicks in high gear, runs pretty loud for several seconds and stops... and the whole process repeats over and over till it drives you nuts... almost like a chinese torture, annoying, crazy-making, chipping away at you, and you cannot make it stop or get away from it.One thing is dealing with noisy fan, but it would be far more tolerable, if it ran constantly for awhile, then stopped, and was done with it.The only way to avoid this incessant on-and-off is to really put only minimal strain on the CPU and to not run too many programs at a time... which of course could be done, but in the big picture it is completely unacceptable having to deal with something like this in the first place.3.Another REALLY big thing are the missing parts of the screen.Not much more than a year after I bought it, about 1.5 inch wide blank white stripe popped up on the screen, running vertically, covering all the data underneath... it was distracting and unappealing, but it was positioned in a way, that was not interfering with the computer use, and I could work around it.About six months ago another stripe showed up, right at the START screen, covering all the important essential function needed for the proper computer use, and at that point I was almost ready to throw the laptop away.I was told, that the repair (as is usually the case with electronics) would be about as costly as getting a new unit, so I almost got a new one then.","This computer is also virtually SILENT - there\u0027s nearly no discernable fan noise.","I was a big fan of Vaio notebooks.","In addition, the ibook is smaller by far and I can actually take it to class without having to hurt my back.3) Noise level: The Compaq was so loud that I would hear a noisy fan almost every time I turned the machine on just to type up a paper or to browse the net making it useless for taking to class since people would stare at me.","As an old guy in his early 30s, I am not a fan for those fancy games, but I did watch DVD on the laptop, and of cause, there is no delay, no distortion at all.","That\u0027s the beauty of this system; you actually have a fan base that most other systems don\u0027t.","And WORST of ALL, the fans are not strong enough for the big processor that Toshiba put in the computer.","I don\u0027t notice or mind the fan, comes on intermittently for a few seconds once in awhile.It\u0027s a big change in many ways from the ultra-tiny Sharp Actius it\u0027s replacing, (faster, better screen, fast big drive, heavier), but a good value.I haven\u0027t dealt with Toshiba tech support, and I hope I don\u0027t have to.","I solve that problem by getting a cooling pad/fan for it.","The fan could be quieter though.All in all it is a good laptop for the price and I recommend it.","The fan on this baby hardly ever comes on.","This notebook runs hot, so the fan runs considerably longer and louder than on other units I\u0027ve owned.","Even the rarely active fan is quiet.","This is a rip off by Sony and their tech support simply replied: \"It\u0027s a misprint!\"Now I also believe Amazon Fan that \"don\u0027t bet on Sony customer service, they will not accept that it is their fault\". for 1500 dollars, i recieved a very fast, aesthetically pleasing laotop with modern capabilities.","I bought this laptop and yes I did notice it was a bit slow with Windows Vista,What I did was upgrade the RAM to 2.5 Mhz and installed Windows 7 UltimateNow this machine runs smooth my Cpu runs runs at a constant 8 to 12% during everyday usemy fan hardly ever runs and this machine is faster than the average newer laptops that I have seenI work with electronics everyday mainly laptops and I can honestly say that while it was running Vista I was disappointed and looking for something different but after installing Windows 7 I am completely satisfied with the performance of this incredible machine, I would recommend this laptop to anyone that asks, also keep in mind that yes this is an older latop but it is still retailing well over $900.00 I bought this laptop around June of 2005 and have been extremely happy with it.","While my Tecra\u0027s one cooling fan was obnoxiously noisy, the 1905\u0027s two cooling fans (one on the left side in the rear, and one on the bottom of the computer) are surprisingly and wonderfully quite.","However, you can barely hear the fan noise from the Sony either only if you use the laptop in the quiets area or at midnight.For the heating, the previous reviewer just exaggerates too much \"This laptop gets heated up so much that you cannot hold it\".","25 percent of the time it won\u0027t recognize something in there, and is very finicky about CDs, often developing playback issues (or just complete failure) the longer the time you are accessing the CD.Now, cut to a year later - conveniently, right at the end of my warranty - and the laptop is randomly shutting down whenever it feels like it (presumably the unit is overheating due to a broken fan or something along those lines).","That being said, I noticed within 5 minutes of getting it out of the box that the fan noise was going to drive me crazy.In a room with 3 desktop PC\u0027s this was the loadest machine.","When gaming, the fan is loud and the laptop gets very hot.","I needed a new laptop as the Compaq\u0027s CPU fan died.","UPDATE: Sept. 17, 2005 I figured out how to solve the loud fan issue.","I can do pretty much everything a college student and more can do.The only thing i dont like about this laptop, well there are two, are first, the fan, and second the weight.The fan is loud and it runs non-stop.","I cannot stand it.Oh, and do you know why the fan is so loud? It\u0027s because the computer runs so hot! The processors generate an incredible amount of heat (which is fine), but the system is so poorly designed and unventilated that the bottom of the computer is not warm, not hot, but scalding.","Is there anyone who has the same fan noise issue? As noted by others, this is not a touchscreen PC even though it is advertised as having that feature.","I guess that\u0027s why acer is still charging the same price as 4 months ago! I\u0027ve had this laptop for about 4 months now, and the overall performance has been as expected for a Pentium 4 machine.One serious downside though is the fan noise.","One nice thing, is the fan does not run full blast all the time.","I could live with the fan as it rarely runs, but the hard drive noise is almost constant, every time the system hits the HD the drive clicks.On the positive side, the system does have some neat features, such as the ability to play DVD/CDs with the case closed and still have access to the controls, including volume, play, pause, etc.","After a while several problems occured:1) The noise of the running fan is loud, independent from the number of the applications.","I wouldn\u0027t hesitate giving this model a 5 star rating, were it not for its outrageously loud cooling fan.","In begining week, computer stayed cool, fan hardly came on, and now it stays on most of the time, computer gets warm, while playing video game, fan constantly stays on and starts making noise, it happens when visiting flash site or anything contain flash comes on.Crappy Built quality - Color on Speaker cam on in 4 months!! It simply started with small dot and with in about 2 week it expanded well over inch.Simply I think My $1500.00 is wasted, hp seems to can\u0027t fix this issue looking at few other buyer\u0027s comments.Stay Away from DV8000 or DV5000 as both have keyboard problems.","The fan activates only occasionally, though that will depend on what you use it for.","I\u0027ve been a PC fan for the past 20 years and used Linux as an alternate to windows in many cases.","There are several good books in the market place that can act as reference manuals Fan is bit too noisy.","Worse things are noise from fans, heat generation is huge and the fans don\u0027t ever shut of.","Fan makes a lot of noise all the time.","Toshiba has the worst customer service.It is okay once you upgrade 256 memory to more than 512 (You need to buy PC2-4200(DDR2) memory, unless it won\u0027t work).Pros:- Good price- Very bright screen- Reasonable speed- Good technical supportCons:- Noisy fan- Short battery life with standard batteryReally annoying customer serviceDon\u0027t forget to turn on wireless funcation by pushing button in front of laptop, I learned by calling Toshiba technical support.","Even with the most aggressive power saving settings the fan will run - even when the machine is sitting doing nothing with the screen off! And it is not just that it runs - it is variable speed and yet it cycles on and off at ~10 second intervals, you can\u0027t imagine how annoying that is, it would be better if it just would pick a middling speed and stay on.","I\u0027ve read other reviews were people have actually returned there notebooks because of the fan.","Like the T150 I am satisfied with my TXN15P in overall, but its fan noise is really annoying.","Three or four months later, the fan started screwing up.","Also kind of neat was a built in meter right on the battery itself which is accessed by setting up the Q1\u0027s stand and then you could push a little button on the battery and it will show you power level on it\u0027s LEDs- \"AVS\" Program: Reading about this, it is supposed to be a mini OS that can play movies and music and show pictures without having to go into the Main OS, but I could never get it to not fire up Vista before running.... so basically it\u0027s useless for lack of a better description- Wireless/Internet: Bluetooth, Wireless a/b/g, and a direct Ethernet connection all work very well, I had no problems connecting to anything on my travels- Data Entry: Not really a big fan of the \"Orgami\" keyboard program, but the Tablet keyboard entry with the included stylus works well, but for serious typing a bluetooth/USB keyboard and/or mouse is recommended.","The major problem 1 is Fans installed at bottom of the laptop which makes system power off when u place on bed or any cushion surface.","there are two fans on the bottom positioned just in the middle and top left.","But a little tap on the fan does the work almost every time.4.","There is some fan noise, but very little.","I love the Dvd/Cd+Rw drive, and built in 3.5 Floppy.Bads: The fan can be a bit noisy if you plan on leaving your computer on overnight.","It has worked well except for the fact that it almost constantly has its rather noisy fan on because it seems to run hot.","I\u0027m a big fan of the mouse pointer in the on the keyboard and would not know what to do with out it.","Excessive fan noise had been a problem; this one is extremely quiet.","Extrmely noisy - The fan gives out so much noise that it is really embarresing to take this one to a class or even a meeting!4.","The fan that comes on to keep the hardware cool is so silent, I almost never notice it running.","The fan is kind of noisy and seems to come on a lot but everything works okay.","It performed flawlessly.It does get pretty warm and the fan does run at varying speeds, but it never got hot enough to be a danger to itself or my flesh, although I put something under it when on my bare legs on a couple of very hot muggy days in Brooklyn.","The fan was expensive.","But SONY should throw a pair of earplugs for those who would rather not hear the whiz of the cooling fan all day.","I was initially hesitant to buy this laptop because of the heat and fan complaints.","The lightness and small package makes the transition worthwhile.It does heat up quickly and is almost uncomfortable but there should be air conditioning in starbucks so put it on a table and you\u0027ll be fine.The battery sucks even after I calibrated it and the fan.","Mainly with the cooling system, the fan is extremely loud, and I have had to send it back twice due to the cooling system.","The cooling fan is very noisy.","PC users are crazy about the right click....I suppose it is not that integral in my personal experience (I\u0027m a big fan of key commands).-The sound is not that great.","You can turn off the fan on

based Pismo (Apple fans know what this is), I chose the iBook instead of the PB.","I have had a grand total of 4 problems with this computer, two of which were major viruses, another one when my hard drive crashed, and another one where the fan stopped working.","The fan is fairly silent and wont make a loud noise.I never used the lightscribe feature so can not comment on that, but did burn a bunch of DVDs with no issues.As my title says go ahead and buy it if you need it badly, but beware, you might get a lemon.","I purchased a Sony k35 and Had very bad bad Experience with it..I was a very good fan of sony products till I bought this laptop.","That\u0027s great if your MP3 player or camera that accepts SD cards.I am occasionally annoyed by the fan cycling when the processor is working hard, but it IS very quiet.","Because of the water damage, even though I have AppleCare, the repair is not covered--Apple wants close to $1000 to repair a system that at this point, it\u0027s not even worth that anymore.I have always been a big Apple fan for many years and own many of their products.","And unlike those laptops, this one cools down when you put it on a hard flat surface, and I barely notice that the fan is running to vent it.","What I have noticed is that:1) The fan is loud, as others have proclaimed2) The DVD player freezes at the start of a movie -I\u0027ve worked with Compaq support from their web site for a couple of days and found that I needed to download Softpaq SP23136 which updates the drivers.","I know it will be unpopular with Mac fans but hope it

the fan area, but there was hardly any dust there.","but the fan makes a lot of noise.","On my unit when the fan is going full blast, it sounds about the same as a CD Drive on a Desktop computer.","A solution to this is purchasing a laptop fan to help with airflow.","One of the only positives is that I did get it back quickly, but within 2 day the fan is extremely loud again, the CD burner still doesn\u0027t work, the internal wireless is spotty at best, and it still gets flaming hot to the touch.","I was very anxious to go home and use it since I thought that it was good laptop for a good price: 1100.Day 1: its light and looks nice.Day 2: Overheats, very noisy, fan does not stop working even if the computer is idle.Day 3: hard drive sounded like it was grinding (still does from time to time) which worried me a lot so I started backing up my data every day.Day 4: the built in webcam SUCKS.","Because it uses heat spots to map your fingerprint, the accuracy tends to decrease as your laptop heats up from prolonged use.Finally, by far the most annoying thing with this laptop is the fan.","I don\u0027t think the Intel video card can handle any game that\u0027s graphics-intensive, as

use this \u0027laptop\u0027 on your \u0027lap\u0027.","The fan is the only thing keeping this computer from melting.This is no joke.","First, the cooling fan tore itself apart and had to be completely replaced.","Finally I just plunked down more money for new screen, that works perfectly fine, however at this point the portability (the main reason for getting the laptop in the first place) is a non-existent advantage and a moot point.(And also the fan issue got considerably worse, now that I am running external monitor as a part of the setup).So there it is - one star taken off for each issue, remaining two starts given for relatively reliable performance otherwise.","Main problem was the fan noise.","Because I thought I was going to be getting burnt by the heat spot, I also bought a USB powered fan.","I\u0027ve always been an AMD fan, and this laptop does not fail my expectations.","The fan comes on when you startup windows...sounds like a little hair dryer tucked inside.","Though I have never owned a laptop, I find this one to be of superior quality inside and out.I do agree that the fan is a bit noisy, but that has never really bothered me.","Some of the

Yahoo! toolbar, Kazaa, AvantGo) or minor problems in software that is available (Quicken can\u0027t access accounts on Ameritrade via Macs)-The PowerBook doesn\u0027t have a fan, which is great for the battery, but can cause it to get a bit hot underneath where the user rests his left hand.Regardless of those drawbacks, however, buying a Mac was an easy decision.","I believe a new Mac fan has

(sony says 1 hr min)* The power pin is broken* My DVD drive doesnot work at all.* I couldnot create a restore CD..","I strongly don\u0027t recommend this laptop for those who wish to buy this kind.I am very disappointed with it\u0027s performance particularly with it\u0027s HD-DVD drive.","Right away I busted this thing open, took out the DVD drive and installed a INTEL 120 GB SSD drive in it\u0027s place.","I won\u0027t be buying another Sony Vaio anytime soon.In the last year, I\u0027ve had to have the hard drive replaced TWICE, (along with the keyboard, video card and CD/DVD drive last February - not that anyone told me WHY) and it takes FOREVER for Sony to get the parts to their authorized service centers (in my case, a CompUSA where I, thankfully, bought an extended warranty).","The resolution is great, fast and quiet Centrino processor, the 1 Gig of RAM makes a significant difference, the video driver is powerful, the hard drive is maybe too big, the Super DVD drive is a great bonus too.If you are look for the best bang for the buck, buy this machine.","I did get its twinToshiba Satellite A135-S4527 15.4\" Notebook PC (Intel Pentium Dual Core Processor T2080, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)through Amazon and CompUSA (RIP) and that has been a better experience.If you\u0027ve done your research you\u0027ll know additional RAM is a must, and complaining that it feels slow with 512 MB is like saying a car isn\u0027t cornering right with 13 inch wheels; now you know why it costs so little - so do get that extra RAM, which right now costs about 30 bucks for an additional 1 GB and is easy to install.","The cd/dvd drive works still as does everything else.","again things started slowing down and the DVD drive wouldn\u0027t open.","The DVD drive does get noisy when reading some data DVDs but then again, it is not annoying.The keyboard is just perfect sized, you wont have any trouble using it, the computer is really fast and the screen is awesome, very bright, I usually use it in brightness 6 when on AC power and in 3 when on battery to extend battery life.","However, if you\u0027re able to find or afford the optional 256mb card, I suggest springing for it...just for that added punch.The DVD drive also works like a dream.","I had no problem until the CD/DVD drive broke in early 9/2007.","Then, they mailed me a new CD/DVD drive and told me to change it out; still didn\u0027t work.","Overall, if you can get this laptop for under $400, then get it! I recommend a RAM Upgrade, but I don\u0027t know how, so I Won\u0027t recommend it.PS-The DVD Drive was recieved defective, so I havn\u0027t watched a DVD yet.PSS-If you didn\u0027t already know, USB 2.0 products are backwards-compatible with USB 1.","Second, the second battery (needed if you want to have long run time) requires that you remove the DVD drive.","That\u0027s a fairly rare feature, and nice to have.The included DVD drive reads and writes and re-writes CDs and DVDs, including Dual Layer DVDs.","So far, in three months I have had two logic board replacements, screen defects, and now a slot-loading DVD drive defect which Apple refuses to repair under warranty.","Great for surfing the net anywhere in your house.*Combo Drive:The integrated CD burner / DVD drive means that you can watch DVDs or burn Cds right from your laptop.","First, the CD/DVD drive had problems booting from CDs after a while.","Apparently, this is a common problem, as one of the managers at Best Buy stated that they have been told to \"expect\" this problem and are now \"redirecting\" customers towards other notebooks (Problem DVD drives are apparently as frequent as one out of every 2-3 notebooks).","Better than what I have had in the past.USB ports - There are three side by side and I noticed that when I connect a USB device (mouse) and a Lexar Flash Memory I am not able to use the 3rd, since it does not fit.DVD - I can not say they are all like this but the DVD drive was a bit loud.Overall, I can give this laptop 3.5 - 4 stars.","Then the DVD drive began having problems.","That is the main reason I chose this model, since I don\u0027t want to carry a school bag all the time just for a laptop.For the laptop that I can find for this small size and weight, Sony Vaio is the only one that has built in DVD drive, which I found is definitely a must feature for a laptop.","They only had it about 5 days, so that was actually the only perk to it!Since then it has overall been a fine computer aside from a few quirks: The AV Mode doesn\u0027t work completely depending on what is being played and the cd/dvd drive runs loudly.Battery life is not nearly what it is advertised as unless you only use word.If you can get XP because Vista runs slow, all of the safety features are obnoxious, and there is still limited software that is compatible.","But 2GB is all you need anyway.- DVD drive is a Philips and man is it noisy! I\u0027ve never heard a laptop drive read so noisily!- I have noticed that this laptop is a bit slow, especially when compared to other dual-cores with 2GB memory.","Problems:#1 Sometimes the computer does not recognize the first key that is struck, this happens quite often when I go to enter a password and it is pretty annoying.#2 The screen will sometimes not come back on at all from sleep mode and I have to reset the computer#3 The front right of the case for the DVD drive is bent and prevents disks from ejecting properly, I have to hold a screwdriver or another solid object into the slot to get a disk to eject.","By the time I realized the DVD drive couldn\u0027t be used to record data, I had lots of data that needed to be backed up somehow before taking the unit in for repairs... without a working disk drive backups are very problematic.","Also, plan on an additional $100 expense for an external CD/DVD drive as the X61 has none built in and Lenovo solutions are obscenely expensive.Given its comfort, savvy students, this can be a notebook with omnipotence.","The only concern he has is that there is no internal CD/dvd drive so he had to buy an external one .","HP Pavilion DV2210US 14.1\" Entertainment Laptop (AMD Turion Processor TL-52, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)is very good HP Pavilion DV6105US 15.4\" Widescreen Laptop (AMD Turion MK-36, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, Super Multi Drive)I contacted HP for warranty work on this item.","The CD/DVD drive is very noisy.","The reaction of someone who has never seen it to its size, sturdiness, and form factor is quite impressive.I ichatted with my family without problems with good quality video; the systems overall felt a bit more responsive than my 2-year old MacBook Pro with the first-generation Core Duo chip.If you want a light, thin, sturdy laptop with full-size keyboard, a gorgeous screen, MacOS X (10.5), and you don\u0027t necessarily need a CD/DVD drive (you can buy an external one, but somehow lugging this extra piece around somehow defies the purpose of the MBA), and can put up with not \"optimal\" hard-drive performance, then the MBA is exactly what you want!I would buy the USB-ethernet adapter, though.If you need high-speed performance, FireWire, a high-end graphics card, a built-in DVD/CD drive etc, then the MBA is not for you - but I guess then you would not be looking at this page...;)Honestly, I could not be happier with my purchase.","They have also had their share software glitches which did not impress me and needed external CD/DVD drives.","It also has a fixed DVD drive that you can use to copy cds from.","We did have to send it in to get the DVD drive replaced, but that was fairly painless.","If the DVD drive hadn\u0027t died I would have given this unit 5 stars.","For business needs or for entertainment (traveling), DVD drive is really necessary.Performance wise it is not bad.","The only problem that I\u0027ve come across has been lately, involving the CD/DVD drive.","A week into my trip, the DVD drive hung up and there was no way for me to re-boot the notebook.","I can spot the enemy coming a lot sooner with the bigger screen.The DVD drive has a 1X write speed.","I purchased it in 2006 if memory serves me, the first one was another model and had a bad DVD drive.","But I recently purchased a re-manufactured Pavilion DV5000, with an AMD chip set, and so far my experience with HP is mostly okay.The 15.4 inch screen is large enough to actually see, and the system includes most bells and whistles one could wish for, including a 4-layer Cd-DVD drive, wireless networking (and traditional lan connections), an 80 GB hard drive, ample memory and even a telephone jack, presumably to send faxes and make conference calls.Several weeks into the new windows experiment, my wireless card malfunctioned.","I do not miss the 3.5 disk drive and the portable, non-powered CD-RW/DVD drive is great and fast! The battery life is great.","The dvd drive is a excellent feature and more of a added bonus but the cd burner is an awsome little burner and usful for on the spot recording (I\u0027m a broadcast student).The bundle software I am never a big fan of but it does include some very handy software such as money 2003,Intervideo 2004 and Works those are just a few but the ones I use the most.The techincal support is the best support team out there they will speak english to you instead of computer lingo and will accaully be nice when the custumer is getting upset.I have use Sony\u0027s tech support on and off for the last three years and they truely know how to treat their custumers with kindness.I would say comparing to the computers I have used in my life (Hewitt Packard,Dell and Gateway) you are getting more for the money when you purchase a Sony Vaio and you are buying quality.","It does have a few flaws - very low volume through the external speakers, fairly loud cd/dvd drive and only about an hour\u0027s worth of battery life.","I always thought that not having a cd/dvd drive would be ok, but I find I use it more often than I thought.There is one thing on this laptop I would change.","Finally, I got a notice that there would be one more attempt before its being shipped back to California (!), so I had to take a full day off from work so I could make sure I was home! I finally got my laptop back almost exactly one full month after sending it back.And the CD/DVD drive is still very picky.","Noisy DVD drive during the read/write process, but I know few laptop or computer with a quiet one.","Then about a year after I bought it, the CD/DVD drive started having problems.","Last time they decided to replace the CD/DVD drive, which was possibly the only part that was actually working, and the new one they put in didn\u0027t work.","That never happened when I had a Dell!I bought the external DVD drive and used it to load some software.","Aside from a few trojans I downloaded and a dvd drive that no longer burns cds, it has functioned perfectly.","This computer sucks, the dvd drive does not work, I had to buy a special internet card plus an ethernet cable to get the internet to work, It does not have wifi and now the computer wont even turn on, it flashes a blue screen then keeps starting over.","My machine came with 15.4 brightview screen ,512 ram,128MB ATI RADEON(R) XPRESS 200M video, double layer DVD drive, built in wireless, 80 GB HD.","I\u0027ve gone through, 1 hard drive, 3 batteries and 1 CDRW/DVD drive.","\"It\" mainly referred to the DVD drive, built-in ethernet and perhaps superior hard-drive speed/access time.","On November 28th, 2007 I purchased an HP Pavilion Notebook DV9260US 17\" Entertainment Notebook PC (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T7200, 2 GB RAM, 240 GB Hard Drive, HD Super Multi DVD Drive, Vista Ultimate).For a week or so I wasn\u0027t sure if I would have my purchase completed because of the inept people that work or answer emails at Amazon Com.I had earned 21 gift certificates for purchases thru my Visa Chase Cardamounting to $525.00 Since I live in New Hampshire, gift certificates never expire because of the New Hampshire State Laws.","Good HP Pavilion dv6365us 15.4\" Entertainment Notebook PC (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T5600, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium) GOOD:I was very happy with light weight and keyboard feel.BAD:It was unbelievably slow to boot up on Vista.It died in the 11th month, after relatively light use.ANY LAPTOP USED FOR BUSINESS:Always back up current files on a thumb drive and back up to a portable hard drive regularly.","I would buy this computer all over again but if the same things started happening and HP still did nothing I would never buy any of the products they make again !!!!! I love my laptop but after about a year, my cd/dvd drive is starting not to work properly.","No advice was given on the possible problems that Vista might cause with incompatible software, and I had big trouble: upon installing Photo Impression 5, the DVD drive stopped working, and System Restore did not help, or work at all.","If 2100US fits your requirements then it\u0027s a good buy for its competitive price! Compaq Presario F761US 15.4-inch Laptop (AMD Athlon 64 X 2 Dual Core TK-57 Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Vista Premium)I bought my Presario after an incident with a roommate which involved a glass of water spilling across my old laptops keyboard.","The specs did not show clearly that it has no DVD drive.","After I removed all unwanted software, the laptop became noticeably faster.2nd - DVD drive did not work and I found some more people complaining about this issue online.","From its good looks to dvd drive to good size screen , and its futuristic presence you\u0027ll enjoy this comp.","So its possible to find good deals on this laptop new for under $800 (I bought mine in Feb 08).There are a lot of excellent reviews out there so not much more to ad in that department - most complaints were regarding defective dvd drive and problems with bluetooth.","Web pages display fine and I don\u0027t have any complaints about scrolling since it is very easy to do and not even a problem.The stock battery (VGP-BPS6) is fairly useless - I get about an hour out of it with the UX390N on high performance, about two hours on Vaio Optimized (screen dims, slower performance).The high capacity VGP-BPL6 battery is a must add-on and I get several hours use with it on high performance.You should also consider the VGP-DDRW4 external DVD drive - you\u0027ll need it or a compatible drive for backups, to load applications, etc.","Further the nominal 4.2 lbs of weight is very light considering how feature rich (built in DVD drive \u0026 60GB hard drive) this machine can be.Sony has been hit or miss in the laptop game recently.","This is the most reliable computer I have owned...except the cd/dvd drive pooped out a year or so ago and now I have to use an external drive for that.","I also use the eathernet to load all my softweare from the CD/DVD drive on my desktop through the network, works great!It also will piggy back on any Blue Tooth phone for internet access AND ... the US models come with a Cingular SIM CARD ...","It had a hot processor, but the DVD drive died completely just two days after it arrived.","Their solution to the dead DVD drive was to reformat the hard drive (I refused).","It really isn\u0027t an issue unless you are using processor intensive applications or using the DVD drive for prolonged periods.","Five months after I bought it, the fun began - and the only bright side to this story is that it happened under warrantee.First, the DVD drive died.","It is VERY slow in comparison.After using the origninal unit for just two days, I really liked it despite a flimsy DVD drive.","And my DVD drive is not noisy.","I compared every reputable manufacturer I could find and this was the lightest, most powerful laptop that had all the features I wanted (i.e. combo CD/DVD drive built in, \u0026lt; 4 lbs, screen \u003e 13\").","It\u0027s sad that Fujitsu doesn\u0027t aggressively market its stylish and feature-packed laptops like the other companies.Weighing in at a mere 4.1 pounds with battery and the DVD drive, the LifeBook really comes to life outdoors, because the \u0026quot;super-bright\u0026quot; LCD screen is beautiful and actually viewable on a nice sunny day here in Manhattan.","Luckily I had one already from my Sony digital camera, so I do not need to buy one.2) Second battery bay - What they don\u0027t tell you is you have to remove the DVD drive to use it.","A powered DVD drive from another manufacturer (ours is from Toshiba) works on a powered USB hub.","I\u0027d rather get an external DVD drive and move on.I\u0027d strongly recommend to Amazon: Please do NOT sell any more of this version of Vaio.","Get 12 cells for 6+ hrs- Single push-forward, centrally located latch button (now that is a biased convenience thing that came from Satellite)- Cool blue lighting- All connections on the sides, none in the back- Great CD/DVD drive that finally reads all CDs!

I got this A13585-s4527 from Office Depot and added 2 gig memory and removed Vista and installed XP Professional.","Yes I would like 2-3 USB ports, but Targus makes some really tiny 4 port hubs for now.I\u0027m honestly not sure I would make any different design choices, and technology progress will take care of the only thing I\u0027ve found to be occasionally very limiting (disk size and performance). after buying and returning two laptops for various reasons, i have to say that the acer 4504 is by far my favorite.. and the 2nd benefit is that it was the cheapest of them all!the screen is digustingly clear, the curvature of the keypad helps eliminate accidentally touching the touchpad, hinges are sturdy, etc.**update, 7/25/05:the silver case holds up much better than i thought... it looked like it was flaking off, like i\u0027ve heard averatecs do occasionally..","I can barely hear anything even on max volume; I\u0027ve had to hook it up to external speakers to have a decent listen to my music.- No 6-pin firewire ports.","The port replicators do not support fast Ethernet connection well.","The lack of connectivity, the insufficient USB ports, and the underperformance make me think that I have something nice but close to useless.","Again, if you\u0027re using this for an Office/Classroom PC, that\u0027s not an issue.One thing I love about Averatec\u0027s PC is the three USB ports on the front side on the right.","As a long time Apple user I almost bought an iBook but the Sony gave more for the amount of money I could spend such as legacy ports (so I could use my printer) and a floppy drive.","Everything still works, including all the ports I use, like the USB, firewire, 56K Modem, and the Adapter port.","Sleep mode still consumes some power and I prefer to hibernate.- You get a \"line in\" port, not a microphone jack.","The HDMI port is a plus too because now I can fire up either of my 45\" lcd hd tv\u0027s with this little gem.","However, this machine should have been given 32 or 64 megs of *dedicated* video RAM) Overall, this is a very good machine that would be a great machine were it equipped with onboard USB 2.0 ports, a little beefier video memory, and were it to weight a pound or so less.","This laptop has a lpt and serial port where my 5205 only has USB.","It has only 2 USB ports (both on the right side) , could use two more on the other side (where the power cable goes), needs firewire and a card reader and bluetooth would be nice (apparently available on the 14\" model).","With 40 gig hard disk, 512 meg memory, DVD/CD RW, 15\u0026quot; TFT screen, 1.8Mhz Athlon, 64meg ATI Radeon 4xAGP 3d graphics, built in 10/100 Ethernet, 7.5 pounds isn\u0027t too bad.No Firewire port or 802.11b wireless built in.","What I did not like is that it has only 1 PS/2 Port which means that either you can connect a mouse or a keyboard but not both simultaneously.","However, with two USB ports, one FireWire port, VGA port (and cable included), built in 10/100 ethernet and a built in 56k modem I\u0027m hard pressed to think what I would need them for.","The Averatec 6240 is a potentially nice laptop with 1280x800 screen, 4 USB ports, 64-bit AMD processor, and upgradable to 2GB of ram.I\u0027ve upgraded my laptop to the max 2GB, and it is very nice that way.","I LOVED my sweet little IBM ThinkPad, but when its USB ports died, the Help Desk manager ordered the HP Compaq for me, on our company\u0027s IT purchase contract.","If you\u0027re flying, consider purchasing an in-flight charger adapter.My only additonal rant is Toshiba\u0027s abandoning legacy ports on this model.","PORTS: Note only one PCMCIA slot available.","However, my experience with this laptop was SO ABYSMAL that I feel that I am morally obligated to forewarn consumers considering buying a Toshiba laptop, nevertheless an M45.In just under two years, I have experienced the following issues:- The chrome paint on the casing fades where my hands rested- The left touchpad button\u0027s paint came off as well- The screen developed a yellowish shade on the bottom in the center- The USB ports broke (both physically and when repaired they simply stopped functioning as well! Poor craftsmanship all-around)- The keys occaisionally popped off (fixable but annoying)- The disc drive stopped working...","The built-in wireless card works great, it has a firewire port, dvd writer/everything drive that works great.","I had problems with the base port station from the start.","It has a Google search box built into the toolbar, prevents pop-up ads (I\u0027ve never had one), has tabbed browsing (preventing a cluttered desktop), and allows for bookmarks to be added with one click.iChat allows Mac users to customize their AIM and Rendezvous chat sessions in ways that the normal applications don\u0027t allow, such as adding pictures from iPhoto to their profile.I haven\u0027t mastered iPhoto yet, but it is downloading pictures from a digital camera is as easy as plugging it into the USB port and clicking a button.Also, Macs are less likely to get a virus or be overtaken by spyware.The iCal and Address Book look good, but if you are going to sync a PDA with your Mac, you are better off using Palm Desktop software.","Toshiba has finally done it!It blitzes the field on most major points: massive RAM (expandable to 2GB), although I would have liked to see faster RAM, generous hard drive (80GB, 5400rpm), although I would have liked to see 7200rpm, huge screen that is perfect for wide-screen movies, built-in TV tuner, the latest Wi-Fi capability built in (802.11a/g), four USB 2.0 ports, FireWire port, although the placement of this port is not ideal, legacy parallel port, although it has no legacy serial port, dual monitor support, external CD controls, DVD-Multi drive that does EVERYTHING in one \u0027box\u0027!, built-in modem and ethernet, PCMCIA cardbus Type I and II, Harmon/Kardon speakers, although I am disappointed that Toshiba did not include the sub-woofer as with previous models, and so much more.My only other disappointments (but not enough to dampen my enthusiasm) are the short battery life (1.5 hours, but this is to be expected with such a powerhouse), not the best bundled software (MSWorks instead of MSOffice?? Come on, guys!), average soundcard (but this is no problem with the plethora of USB and PCMCIA soundcards now available), and not the maximum graphics RAM (64MB... would have expected 128MB in an extreme machine like this).When all is said and done, though, I\u0027m stoked! I\u0027ve taken out extra insurance on this baby! I\u0027ve been working on and with computers (mainframes) since 1967 and personal computers since 1990.","This thing is huge, there\u0027s plenty of room for a regular port--I don\u0027t get it.","In addition, I am not sure that SONY tested the port replicators thoroughly.","So far - screen quality amazing, sounds excellent (better than any other I\u0027ve heard), and the way the ports are arranged are very user friendly as mentioned by the other reviewer.","no need for bought software or software that came with your camera.the interesting new low-charge standby mode is useful and pleasant.it has win-dvd, which works, but--the escape key on my keyboard doesn\u0027t work at all, ever, (!) and i have to shut down the computer completely to get a movie off the full screen.there are only two usb ports, but you don\u0027t need one for pics anymore, and there are two picture card ports.i can\u0027t watch videos on the internet for more than three seconds without their freezing up.sometimes the computer gets confused, freezes, and jumps around the internet.","I called Toshiba about my defective USB ports, they told me they would send me a box to have my laptop repaired in, then they didnt send anything.","Quality, Value, Good Support, Application Support.- Value: With my MBP I get a high speed process 2 GHz+, 2GB ram, 17 in monitor, 100 GB disk space @7500, 3 USB ports, 2 400 and 1 800 firewire port.","However, there are FireWire ports available, and these are quite fast for peripherals that are IEEE-1394 compliant (though it appears that USB 2.0 will be the winning technology in the high-speed peripheral connection protocol battle).","every port and plug is fine and the machine always works.i wrote this because these old machines are great for extra machines or beginner (kids) machines and i thought some input would help.why get a cheap netbook when these are so much better and cheaper?i hope i helped.","It is even lighter than my first VAIO, yet has the DVD and 2 USB ports included.","and i love to play some music files i downloaded from internet on tv. but i can\u0027t do it on sony coz it doesn\u0027t have a S-video port.6.","4 convenient full sized USB ports around the machine\u0027s periphery and one mini-USB, one COM port, one LAN outlet, one RG11 phone jack, a PC card slot, a PS1 socket, mic and headphone jacks, a PC Card slot and a slot for media cards such as flash memory.","Plus its so light I can take it anywhere!The only thing I don\u0027t like about it is that it doesn\u0027t have a firewire port.","Other than USB, has oodles of I/O ports, even a good old-fashioned IrDA for hotsyncing my Clie and Handera PDAs.Otherwise, this is a reliable and solidly built computer.","However when you are docked with the port replicator the system shows as having two ethernet ports, it isn\u0027t clear if that hardware is built into the port replicator or simply only accessible through the port replicator.Sony continues the tradition of not offering restore CDs.","The HP advisor no longer works and freezes the computer for about a full minute when it pops up.The laptop only has three USB ports, which sounds like a lot, but isn\u0027t.","4 USB ports!- Videocard will run BF2 and/or Longhorn/Vista equally well.- If you\u0027re wondering about the speed - run some tests, don\u0027t just rely on your feelings, you\u0027ll be pleasantly surprised!- You can\u0027t see it on the pictures, but the finish is nicely soft to touch on the working surface :)In short, I think this notebook is worth every dime!This review has been typed using it.","The unit on the side has a PC card /smartcard slot and an infra red sensor to transfer files to another infra red compatible device\u003e I dont think I\u0027ll use that infra red stuff! But for the card slot , I ordered a PC card with 4 USB2 ports($20)since the two ports on the machine are only USB 1.","Despite the fact that on 08 Sep 2007 the item description for the HP tx1220us still clearly states that it has \"1 FireWire (also known as IEEE 1394 or i.Link) port for connecting digital video camcorders and other peripherals\" it DOES NOT have this port.It has an ExpressCard/34 slot that can apparently accommodate a card offering such a port, but neither the PC itself nor the Expansion Port 3 offers IEEE 1394 capability according to HP documentation.","I chose to purchase this over the Compaq 1720US because of the addition of an extra USB port, PCMCIA slot, and better graphics card.Unfortunately, I have had the same problem with both machines, a loud whirling fan and a clicking hard drive.","Alot fo people are negative about this product because of it\u0027s lack of a DVD drive and an ethernet port, I very very rarely use them so it fits me just fine.","I was traveling, and plugged a device into the USB port on the video card (left-hand side)... and the video card failed on me.","Uninstall it and download AVG free version - it\u0027s far better than other anti-virus programs.Now, for the rest..Pros:- Big, beautiful display capable of giving you an amazing video experience.- LARGE (160GB) harddrive! Nice.- 2GB of memory! 2048 MB 533 MHz DDR2 (2 1024)- Has Firewire port.- AMD dual core processor.","But for those of you who have taken the leap into DSL -- I\u0027ll admit that I\u0027m still using only a dial-up connection -- then this is something you won\u0027t have to worry about since this laptop has an ethernet port.","Amazing.One other feature not mentioned by other reviewers: all ports (USB, PC-MIA, etc.) are on the sides of the laptop (just two--headphones and microphone) are on the front, near a conveniently placed volume control, and (this is cool) a switch to turn Wifi connections on/off.","The ONLY drawback is that there is only 1 USB port and it is 1.1 but that is very easily solved with a $15 PCMCIA card with USB 2.0 ports.","With P4 and all the applications, this is expected I guess.- No INFRARED port!! I was disgusted when I found this out recently.- Toshiba Support is NOT good.","One USB port is never enough and although I knew all these facts before I bought it and I do have another macbook older version I just struggle with this machine constantly.","S-Video output, DVI output (plus a VGA adapter), Firewire 800, Firewire 400, Gigabit Ethernet, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out, and a PC card slot.","Both have a USB port on them to let you free up a USB port on the Mac itself.3.","Secondly, I wish there were more usb ports, it has 3 all on the right side.","The employee was greatful for the three USB 2 ports, the SD port, and especially the DVD-Burner married with a fire-wire port.These machines are worth looking at in person before you make any decision.","I can edit files on Windows Media Player, iTunes, Word and Photo Gallery, browse internet, sync iPod or Creative Zen Vision M, and plug in several devices into its six USB Ports, all at the same time.I especially love its flare carmine caes, sooooo beautiful.Its 240GB HD (two 120 GB drives, 5400 RPM) may not be good enough compared to the newer models out there, but it still works.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and I will still choose Toshiba when I am ready for an upgrade.","But NO FIREWIRE port was discovered by me; instead Acer put a plastic plug at the place where FireWire suppose to be! When I hardly removed it I found there is just an empty hole but no FireWire.","They are on the right side toward the front, which means that if you have limited space and a usb mouse, the 2 front ports put wires right where you want your usb mouse or wacom pad or number pad to sit.","The difference I noticed from my other laptop is that there is a lack of ports which might add to the fact that it has an incredibly simple design and that it uses only what it needs.","The Latitude has inadequate USB connectivity (only 1 port), and wastes precious back panel space on a PS/2 stylekeyboard/mouse port and a 25-pin parallel port.Once you plug in a mouse, you have NO USB connectors left for a digital camera or other peripherals.","From what I can tell so far, the only deficiencies are:1) the bottom gets super hot! If you use it on your bare lap, chances are you\u0027ll get burned!2) the speakers are very weak and hard to hear3) doesn\u0027t have a built-in CD burner4) USB ports are in the back of the unit.","There are plenty of ports to connect peripherals to, and the screen looks great.There were some disappointing aspects too.","Because the campus I go to is wired for wireless LAN, I can check my email and surf the web without having to carry around a separate cat5 cable and find a port I can plug into.","I would recommend trying one first at a Best Buy or circuit city.Pros:- Attractive design - thinner and more eye-pleasing than M35/M35X predecessor- Exceptional sound from built-in speakers, though deeper bass is lacking- Quiet keyboard with easy-to-depress keys, though see issues below- TruBrite display produced excellent images- Touchpad is smooth and has good tactile feel- Sonoma platform with 533MHz FSB- Solid WiFi performance- Wide array of connectivity options: 3 USB 2.0 ports, FireWire, SD/MMC/xD/MS/MS Pro Media Card slot- Very quiet and cool to the touch - fan came on rarely and made a pleasant sound when running- Toshiba power management and system management software: Touch and Launch, Acoustic Silencer, graphical WiFi utility- S-Video (TV Out) for connection to projectors and TVsCons:- TruBrite display exhibits lots of glare, though this is common on nearly all glossy LCD\u0027s- Lacks DVI output and Express Card- Display exhibits too much flex and seems fragile- Poor 3D performance due to integrated graphics and shared memory- Below Average Battery life- Slower 333MHz DDR memory rather than newer 533MHz DDR2 memory, though lower latency (CL 2.5) generally compensates for slower speed- Keyboard seems slightly cramped and is shifted to the right rather than centered; dedicated Windows key is inconveniently located in upper-right area of keyboard- Relatively low-resolution 1280 x 800 display (98 PPI), though TruBrite has good color \u0026 contrast I bought this machine a little over a month ago, it replaced my Powerbook G3 1.5 Ghz.","i purchased a targus chillhub for that reason (chillhub also gives 4 extra usb ports!) This laptop has many great features to it, but still has some draw backs.","Both lack the PC Card (PCMCIA) slot but can accommodate AirPort Extreme wireless network.Other than faster G4 processor, just about the only reasons to consider 12\" PowerBook are:- Larger memory capacity on the PowerBook (1.25 GB vs. 640 MB)- Larger hard disk (40 GB vs. 30 GB)- PowerBook can drive an external display (dual display) up to 2048-by-1536 via DVI port; iBook can only mirror up to 1024-by-768 via VGA port- SuperDrive (DVD burner) is optional on PowerBook; it is not available on iBook- Bluetooth is standard on PowerBook; it is optional (built-to-order) on iBook- Marginally faster GeForce FX 5200 graphics card on PowerBook (vs. Radeon 9200 on iBook)- PowerBook is slightly lighter (4.6 lbs vs. 4.9 lbs) and slightly smaller (10.9-by-8.6-by-1.18 inches vs. 11.2-by-9.1-by-1.35 inches)- You like the PowerBook\u0027s anodized aluminum allow chassis betterThere are sufficient reasons to get the iBook instead:- Costs almost 50% less- It is not dramatically slower- Longer battery life (up to 6 hours vs. 5 hours)- Polycarbonate plastic chassis is more scratch proof and offer better wireless network (AirPort Extreme) receptionHow is the iBook in itself? For a little over a grand, you get a beautifully designed notebook (similar to iPod) packed with features: combo CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive, optional 802.11g AirPort Extreme wireless network, beautiful LCD, sensible keyboard layout, snappy performance under included Mac OS X Panther 10.3 -- all in very portable form factor.","AND ... it\u0027s a serious business tool that has made my work SOOOO much easier in just the few weeks I\u0027ve had it ... it\u0027s not just *LIKE* having your desk top computer on your hip is *IS* having your desktop computer on your hip!For internet use the UX taps into any available WiFi and it also has a standard network/ethernet port on the docking station AND on an adaptor, the ethernet runs a bit faster than WiFi, I used it to get Microsoft updates.","Overall - I love this machine and will use it for a long time Here\u0027s why I\u0027d rate this computer a 5 out of 5:First off, the specs aren\u0027t too shabby for less than 900 dollars, IE, Celeron-M 2.40 Ghz, 256 Megs of Ram, ATI Mobility Radeon 7000 (this thing gets 128 megs of shared video memory if you go to half a gig of Ram), 1024x768 at 15\u0026quot;, 40gig hard drive, DVD/CD-RW drive, Firewire, 2 USB ports, 5-One Touch buttons, Touchpad On/Off button (very handy if you are typing something lengthy and constantly have to rest your arms on the touchpad), VGA port, Serial Port, Parallel Port, PS/2 Port, built-in 56k Modem/10/100 LAN combo, Mic Port, Headphone Port, mute button, volume controls on the side of the machine, and an S-Video Port, all weighing just around 6.5 pounds and getting a LONG 4.5 hours from battery.","And with only two usb ports, I will have to buy an extension if I want to run a mouse, an external CD and a video camera simultaneously.Overall, its a good buy, considering its super low price.","The design sensibly omits com, midi, mouse, keyboard and printer ports in favor of 3 USB2 ports.","And at 6.8 lbs, it\u0027s really not that heavy.The video is NOT for gaming! But like I said, you\u0027ll have no problems watching movies and if you use the S-Video (TV Out) Port on a flat screen...","Upon further research, I learned that the bus on the motherboard is what actually goes bad, its a common problem, HP knew about it, and hid the problem, not doing the right thing for customers and swapping the motherboards.When I use the monitor port, my second monitor often forgets its position in relation to the laptop monitor, and I have to set it up all over again.","No ps2 port but i guess no one really uses that anymore anyway.","Other than those things this laptop is FAST and durable, and will be even better when Mac OS X Lion comes out in a few days.So far this what I\u0027ve bought for this laptop and recommend.-Rain Mstand-Logitech Anywhere mouse-Mini Display to HDMI for dual screening with TVs-Apple Wireless Keyboard-USB Hub (Sadly it only has 2 USB ports)-Moshi Clearguard Keyboard Protector (Strongly recommended if you want to keep it looking new) Its exactly what I expected.","It boots up with a decent speed has three USB ports that I found most useful.I almost always use it on the AC adapter, so the battery life is not important to me.","I was afriad it would look washed out, but HP usually does a pretty good job on the screen.Multi-Drive - The DVD burner is a nice touch, but don\u0027t get too excited, keep reading.Good Ports - Including S-VideoCONS: - almost everythingProcessor - Not a dual core.","Even the teacher was dumbfounded at the first she saw it.A DVD-R, CD-RW, 15in Widescreen Display, which is VERY easy to clean unlike other Windows counterparts, Two FireWire ports, Two USB 2.0 ports, super thin and light design (mine is 5 lbs and 1in thin, while other PC notebooks weight as much as 8-10 lbs and 1-2.5 in thick).There is nothing that I can think of doing on this computer that other Windows machine can\u0027t do.","I did not have to consider other smaller units like the hp mininotebook which is miles behind in speed and capacity, etc.The single usb port should not be a prob.","The fact that the machine lacks both parallel and serial ports came as a bit of a shock as there was no way to connect my tape backup to transfer my files, but once past that, on all counts, the machine is a winner...which is lucky, as Toshiba Tech Support is non existent.After an initial call when I got a pilot-voiced Texan who was a Cracker Jack and new his stuff inside out, I thought that configuring the machine would be a breeze.","The only reason I might not call it a true desktop replacement is due to only 2 USB ports, only one optical drive, etc.","On the pluss side its great to have a labtop with a ton of memoree and fast processers its verry compatable with everything Ive pluged up to it lots of ports great sound for a labtop, hp makes updating drivers easy from website, I get fantastic fast wireless access 1500kbps from my home dsl, even faster than if I plug it in, I can plug my cannon elura camcorder dircetly in for fast easy video editing \u0026lt;except ^\u003e big bright screen good graphix, pretty big and heavy for a laptop, alot of machine for the money, I would not purchase this product again though b/c of the issues I do have, and again customer service is a joke, your lucky if the tech support person you get even speaks english, and they always tell me my issues and problems are normal I bought this lapto a week ago and as soon as i turned it on there was a slight discoloration with the screen.","In fact, there\u0027s only one.* The battery is not replaceable.* There is no integrated Wi-Max.* The battery life is on par with current generation Apple laptops.* It\u0027s \"underpowered\" in this generation of overpowered desktop-replacements.Consumers who worry about the above, but still want to run a variation of OS X may purchase this:Apple MacBook MB063LL/B 13.3\" Laptop (2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, 8x Super Drive) BlackOr this:Apple MacBook Pro MA896LL/A 15\" Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive).Or simply get the Thinkpad X300 and run it on a last generation OS.But I gave this 5 stars, why?* It\u0027s beautiful.* The build is solid.* I can carry it in one hand with no effort.And here\u0027s the thing about the lack of ports.* Peripherals will eventually all be wireless.Bluetooth peripherals are already in the marketplace (obviously where Apple hedges its bets on).","This processor is also mobile so you can connect to a wireless network and not have to plug it into an ethernet port.Connections on this laptop are as follows2 USB ports (one on each side)1 PS/2 port1 VGA port for connecting a monitor1 ethernet port1 moden port1 PC card portIt comes with a DVD Rom/CD-RW combo drive as well.","But got an external USB floppy drive which was free after rebates.2.\u0026gt;No firewire to connect to camcorders etc. but it does have a PCMCIA port for additional cards.3.\u0026gt;No IR port though it does look its having one.But overall, I am happy with the laptop.","Something else that help didn\u0027t help with is figuring out how to get the sound input from the audio-in port to come out the built-in speakers (strangely enough, this is EASIER to do on a PC, unless I am just ignorant and don\u0027t know the \"trick\" to make this happen on a Mac).7.","You will note that there are only two USB ports and 1Gb in memory.","Memory max capacity and no serial port leaves it from missing a 5.","It\u0027s lighter than its predecessor, with a generously sized keyboard (though I do miss a right CTRL key and keep hitting the @#$% Ins key!

And quiet, this machine is quiet.","The fan does kick in occasionally (\u0026lt;2% of the time) and is a trifle noisy.The HOME and END key are an annoyance as is the USB port positioning on the LHS when using a RHS mouse, although this is not a prob. with a cordless device.Great package and great price.","It includes a toshiba utility that lets you quick launch programs by touching the corners, though I never bother with it.The location of the USB ports are on the sides towards the front.","The laptop has all essential ports: 2 USB, Firewire - iLink, VGA, line out and mic, 1 PCMCIA, Ethernet and modem...6.","Not only is it big and ugly and plastic with ports on every side of it, but it has horrible ergonomics (a weird keyboard with narrower keys that are not the standard size and a horrible set of mouse buttons) and a typical but still cheesy optical drive that you have to slide out and then snap the disc onto the spindle.","I hook a 7-port USB 2.0 hub to the port replicator and I now seriously plan to make this my primary PC, replacing a 3-year-old desktop.One option I\u0027ll look into is, per the advice of a poster in the product forum here, replacing the internal drive with a 100GB one.","Within one month one of the three USB ports became damaged.","This meant that the notebook actually had only 192 MB RAM of the original 256 MB RAM remaining for physical memory use.The only minor problem I found in this computer was that the USB ports were spaced too closely to the round AC power jack.","Plenty of ports (Ethernet, Firewire, USB, speaker, telephone, etc.)5.","VMware runs fine, and have no heavy disk storage requirements.- can get by with the limited port configuration (1 USB port, no Firewire, no Ethernet).If weight doesn\u0027t matter to you, and the other factors are too limiting, then you\u0027d be much better off with the Macbook or the MacBook Pro which meet all your needs and can serve as your primary computer at a better price/value ratio.","I have no issues with the screen (Matte - LG panel).Pros:- Mac OS X- Great preinstalled software package you don\u0027t have to waste your time with uninstalling the junk like on a windows laptop.- Size / Weight compared to other 15.4 laptops- everything regarding to the operation - fast, quiet, illuminating keyboard, magsafe power adapter ...- multiple options to install other operating system - I have Bootcamp / XP on it I only use it for my games.- I found all the other softwares that I needed for Mac.- wide range of custom designed accessories - you can spend a fortune on these :-)Cons:- only 2 USB ports- no multimedia card reader- no docking possibility- can be hot - I would recommend iLap that will solve the problem- fingerprint reader would be nice on a $2500 laptopMy conclusion:I don\u0027t take away stars for the cons because I knew all these things before I ordered my MBP and there weren\u0027t unexpected problems.","The USB port in the rear of the machine was at best, really for connecting a USB keyboard or hardware, for instance.","The laptop has a max resolution of 1280x800 via on scren display but using the graphics card Hdmi port you can get resolutions like 2560x1900, 1920x1080 etc.This laptop has 3 usb ports, a firewire port, lightscribe is amazing print pictures directly to your disc using supported media, Hdmi out, Vga out, S video out, 5 card reader (Does not support SDHC Sd cards) finger print reader for added security, built in webcam and microphone works wonderfully using provided cyberlink software, and comes with a media remote that fits into the express slot.","If you get yourself SimpleTech\u0027s Bonzai Flash Drive, it takes an SD card and can be connected to anybody\u0027s USB 1.1 port.","Another great feature of this system is its speakers (with a sub woofer to boot!) and its ability to play CD\u0027s and DVD\u0027s even if the laptop is closed, doubling as a portable DVD/CD player! If you do multimedia presentations like I do than combining a well made presentation with this notebook\u0027s huge clear LCD screen and vibrant speakers will never fail to impress your clientele.Unfortunately there are no legacy ports for people who would want to connect their old peripherals.","80 gig hdd, Combo DVD Rom/CD +/- R/W, 512 megs memory, 56k modem, 10/100, 32 meg ATI AGP video card, legacy ports, XP Pro, wireless, extra battery, plus some other minor adds.","Sony was the only laptop that I saw that had this feature.4.I like that there are 3 USB ports.","As mentioned elswhere here, you create your own backup disk with CDs or DVD (recomended).I went online after installing my Sprint Aircard 580 software without any problems (such as conflicts with the modem port) and downloaded some of my favorite software available free on trial or at reasonable prices.AVG anti-virus is my favorite; it is excellent but unobtrusive.","First off, the computer looks and feels great; the keyboard, touchpad, and ports all have a solid, sturdy feel to them, and look beautiful to boot.","Three handy USB ports on the right hand side make connecting peripherals a snap, although they are placed close together.This machine has the nicest touchpad I have ever come across - a beautiful light feel and tap-and-drag with locking drags means that you never ever have to use the left mouse button! It\u0027s a synaptics model, so up there in quality with the best.The machine does get a little hot, so you will need to put it on a magazine if you have it on your lap a lot - I got a Targus lap desk from CompUSA.","Recommended! Pro\u0027s:Great screancan hold 1.25 GB of ram.great sizegreat for microsoft office, dreamweaverbattery life is goodCon\u0027s:sucky trackpadthere needs to be in other colurscould be a little thiner Pros: Great screen, super fast, super quiet(no fan noise),WiFi and plenty of USB ports.Cons: The only gripes I have is it only comes with 512 memory, no firewire port and there\u0027s too many Trial programs I don\u0027t want that run in the background that you have to uninstall or kill thru msconfig.I\u0027ve had this laptop for around a week now and am really impressed and pleased with how it performs with only 512 memory on Vista which would have been plenty with XP.","The ethernet port is recessed and you need a long fingernail or a tool to release the clip on the ethernet cable.3.","It gets very hot.4) Memory stick port - Come on Sony, this is a ploy to sell us another one of your products.","There is a little cover over the phone/ethernet ports that comes off at the slightest thought of a touch.","Look at what you get though.CD/DVD burner...built-inWireless connectivity...built-inProductivity software...built-inUSB 2 and FireWire...built-inAV out port...built-inIndustry leading support after the sale...includedMovie creation software...includedDVD creation software...includedMusic management...includedMusic creation...includedPhoto archiving and manipulation software...includedProtection from viri and trojan horses...includedActually the last is a bit of a tease.","Keyboard has wonderful feel/action to it.My only gripe(which may be fixable,but I haven\u0027t found a solution) which is that the USB ports will stop functioning when book is closed.","It plugs into the USB port and the fans keep the air flowing under the laptop.A beautiful screen, admirably fast performance, and general good looks make this Vaio a good choice for anyone except those needing a constant traveling companion.","This system rocks, it\u0027s easy to use and stable.The goodies offered are great and at a fantastic value.The battery life is awesome, yet the disk space could be bigger.2 USB ports, 1 FireWire 400, 1 DVI video (strange format) seem to be enough considering that you have bluetooth for new-generation mouses, printers and extra keyboards.Office\u0027s Excel in spanish has proved to be quite annoying.","Not a con for me because it is easy on my eyes when typing long papers.- No video/web cam on this model.- Only 3 USB ports I have a 7000 series notebook.","I thanked Microsoft for a wasted half an hour to figure it out and then run \u0027chkdsk /F\u0027 to fix the drive and partitioned it immediately after that.The DVD/CDRW combo works fine, same for the Network and the PS/2 port with the classic Y-cable to accomodate both an external mouse and a keyboard.","The low points are: Windows XP preinstalled(as always), no Windows XP CD but Toshiba recovery... so, no posibility to install both OS, and lack of PS2 ports.","there is only one battery port, and if you want to use a secondary drive (or the included tv tuner for that matter) you have to remove the battery.","The only complaint I have is the rear port cover.","It does Ethernet and, while the Ethernet port isn\u0027t built in, it has one on the dock and also on a small dongle so that you still have a portable computer that does Ethernet.","I feel like this lock will crack sooner or later if you use USB port all the time (well, you can\u0027t avoid this if you use mouse).","I absolutely love \"Spaces\", which is an excellent way to make the most of the fairly limited screen real estate.- the machine is not the lightest, but not unduly heavy- if you have some basic screwdriver skills, memory and hard disk are easily user-upgradeable (forget doing that with the Pro unless you\u0027re very handy)Things I would have liked (if ifs and buts were candied nuts...):- \"real\" DVI and VGA ports rather than adapter dongles (probably too hard to do in this form factor)- LED-backlit display- option to replace optical drive by 2nd battery.","Bad design, I guess.8) All the USB ports are on the same side (the left) of the case, so you\u0027ll end up snaking some cables all the way around.","I can\u0027t say the price here.originally aim for presario 1520us. it has faster processor, more RAM, bigger hard disk, and firewire port.","Same goes for the Ethernet and USB ports.","Maybe next time, I\u0027ll even consider a 20-inch laptop.Now that you can run Windows on top of Mac OS with Parallels Desktop or dual-boot to Windows with Boot Camp, isn\u0027t it time to consider a Mac laptop? As a recovering PC-user, I can tell you that I\u0027m glad I switched and I\u0027ll never switch back! Great features, lots of speed and room, big keyboard, 10-key pad and all the ports you would want!Aside from the weight, this has been a wonderful and reliable laptop for my business.","It comes with wireless ethernet, DVD-RW, 4 USB ports, VGA out, ethernet and modem ports and two PCMIA card slots.","However, I was very disappointed to find that one of my USB ports went out on me only a little after a year.","Later in the day turned it on and it sign into the network automatically.- The 4 in 1 integrated card reader is very convenient to transfer files between this and other computers.- Another great feature, specially because you don\u0027t get it for 750 is a 15.4 widescreen.- 4 USB ports, 1 Fire Wire, 1 Video S and a monitor Port- The software included is brand name and well known, including Mc Afee Spyware (30 day trial), Norton Internet Security (90 Day Trial) Nero Express 6.0, Power DVD, Office Trial in case you don\u0027t want to buy it you can settle for Works 8, which seem more complete than the previous version.- Lots of memory a 60, yes you\u0027re reading correctly 60 GB Hard Drive, not a lot by today standards, but most notebooks in its price range have only 40 GB.-Dual Layer multi format DVD+/-RW with up to 8X DVD +/-RI\u0027m really pleased with this purchase, and forgot to mention it looks stylish.","I don\u0027t expect this laptop to make it to a year.My USB Ports started to not recognize my devices.","This requires an adapter that has to be powered by a USB port, but seems to work fine.","You can pick up a port replicator with drive bays for a reasonable price these days.","I miss a parallel port though.","When I used dual display at 1024 pixels the output was slightly choppy on DVD video, but on any single screen it is smooth and flowing.The real advantage with this model is that it incorporates wireless / wired ethernet, firewire port, 3 USB ports and still allows room for expansion via the PCMCIA slot.","There\u0027s no numeric keypad, of course.Get a USB hub, it has only two USB ports.","I bought this laptop mainly because of the new Windows Vista OS.I Took it right out of the box and it\u0027s was very easy to set up.It has 3 USB ports,120 gigs of hardrive memory which is pretty big for right now but I plan to add more in the future, 1 gig DDR2 RAM, a dvd burner, and more.I play alot online with games like Counter strike and Half life 2 on the steam engine.The game play is fast it doesnt\u0027t lag.I showed my friend and he loved this laptop we played CS with no lag and fast load times.It has a decent processor AMD Turion 64X2 dual core.I got the Notebook primarly for school but I seem to be using for anything but that.","First the SPDIF port doesn\u0027t work.","i can even take over the customer\u0027s tool thru the port replicator.key board is small, but if you have been link to a crackberry for the past few years.","As for cons, the lack of firewire ports, two USB ports, and lack of \u0027quick-launch\u0027 buttons take away from the beauty of it, but for this price, you get more than what you pay for.","I didn\u0027t buy it for Lightscribe, but when I first tried out my laptop, I thought I got an added bonus! But alas, Booo to HP for blatantly implying it has LightScribe.Ports: Ports are a bit limited, but it has everything most people could want, TV-output, monitor output, ethernet, modem, wifi.","Only subnotebook to have full size key board (at least that is the way it feels to my very large fingers), yet to be a complete package with built in DVD rather than having to have a docking port and hook up an external drive any time one wants full usability.","(only 3 USB ports.","I guess what this says is that I\u0027ve become a Mac snob, but the PowerBook is just so beautiful and so much more thoughtfully designed, all the ports are on the left side, and there are no legacy ports that no uses anymore any way, and on the right is the snappy slot-loading SuperDrive, for which I can not even describe the satisfaction you get when you put in a disc and it sucks it out of your fingers, giving a soft mechanical sound afterward as it mounts it.","Doesn\u0027t (hasn\u0027t) heated up a lot on me yet.Will observe how it performs Received my unit over 3 weeks ago and everything is still working great.Pros:- Lot of processing power- Beautifull screen- 4 usb ports- TV out- Price- Can be used as DVD player with processor off.","Perhaps it is Apple\u0027s way of justifying the value of the PowerBook... now that both are G4\u0027s.Wishlist: more than one firewire port; I do not have to waste a 128 MB memory chip when I upgraded my RAM to 640 MB; better speakers and metallic finish palm rest please...Overall, I am very satisfied with my decision to upgrade.","There are a few other nice touches such as the touchpad quick launch feature (quicker access to certain features without returning to the desktop and/or Start menu), the wireless \"mapping\" utility (for identifying available wireless networks, including bluetooth devices), and movement detection (which causes the hard drive heads to be \"parked\" in a safe location to avoid accidental damage).The screen is adequate, without being anything to get excited about (no improvement from a previous Port\u0026eacute;g\u0026eacute; bought way back in 2002).","The color black especially is much richer and darker than I\u0027ve seen on other laptops, which is very important if you want to watch DVDs.All in all, the system seems very well-designed: the ports all seem to be in logical places (there are none on the back, which makes sense), and the keyboard, though small, doesn\u0027t feel jammed together (if you have gigantic hands, it will make you miserable - it\u0027s not THAT spacious).","The need of a port replicator is very high as I plug into 3 printers, a flat screen, keyboard, mouse, etc.I ordered the \"Sony VAIO Port Replicator for FS Series (VGP-PRFS1)\" from Sony and waited 2 week for its arrival.","Combined, these elements mean I have a machine that\u0027s far faster and more capable than all of my desktops and almost as capable as my home server (I\u0027m a systems architect, so I know servers).It\u0027s also in possession of some other features that make it a superior value: a wide-screen super bright LCD at 15.4\", a dedicated ATI graphics chip with 256Mb of memory, a dual-layer DVD burner, an SD/MMC/MS card reader, 4 2.0 USB ports, a Firewire port, and two killer radios.Killer radios? Sure.","The screen is bright, the various ports available on all sides is handy and the battery life is OK.","i found the lack of infared port troubling since i am so used to \"beam\" files at work.","If weight and size aren\u0027t an issue I would definitely recommend this notebook.Update!: Finally got around to using the component video out ports and hooked it up to my HDTV, you can set the output all the way up to 720p if your tv supports it, incredible picture! If you want to take advantage of the surround sound capability of this laptop you will need a toslink adapter for the headphone jack, you can find them for a few dollars.","I guess buying a USB flash drive will do.- Two usb ports.","Awesome with sound and video editing.Only problem I still have with MacBooks is that they have too few USB ports for users with printers/scanners/external hardrives etc. save your money and time, this thing was worthless.","The iBook can supply power for such drives through its USB 2 and FireWire ports.No FireWire 800 ports.","I guess I will get used to it in time.The latch that shuts the notebook while unobtrusive seems to be flimsy.Has 3 USB ports placed next to each other at the back.","So, for long plane trips when you are stuck in coach with no AC outlet at hand, you are going to have to work fast before your system conks out, or else carry an additional charged battery.There are three USB ports, a network 10/100 support and a 56K modem that on my unit connects at almost the theoretical maximum speed.","The DVD/CD-RW reads and writes without much hassle.The remote located int he PCI port is a neat little thing to have.","the sony laptop has no infared port, no SD, SC, CM or other flash memory card slots.","You can plug a speaker into the headphone port with mediocre results, or you can use headphones.","This a DESKTOP REPLACEMENT, no doubt!For the features, is NOT so heavy...with the added port replicator is a monster laptop, sound is exceptional thru the 12\" speaker included in the packet.The screen is out of the mind...extremely brilliant and nitid..even better than my office Vaio K23, its 17 inches surpasses all expectations... the bundle softwares is ok, even would be better if would bring some more burning applicationsPROS: Superbrilliant screen, convenient size, 1 gb Ram and 64 mb ATI video card 9600, quick response, 100 Gb HD, not so heavy, nice port replicator, burn Double Layer DVD, wireless work extremely smooth....CONS: Port replicator easily detached in a non-totally horizontal surface (lap, etc), my XP crashed two times with Gigapocket appl. (for TV captures)...no big dealAfter buying this machine I noticed the Toshiba 17\" COSMIO with 100 GB HD, 512 RAm and the TV/Video card inside, no need of port replicator, A comparison would be interesting to find.I wonder why the Vaio A series did not come with all in there as the GRT models did.Anyway this in an excellent laptop for home.","it comes with 2 usb port too, so u can attach any device.","Connect your printer, camera and other gadgets with ease.- Amazing sound quality.- Microphone and Headphone ports at the front.- Warehouse scale hard disk at 120Gb of space!- Burn DVDs and CDs easily.- Very clear, high resolution webcam.- It looks smart.- Battery time is 3+ hours.- Has all the other essential ports such as Network, Firewire etc.Bad:- Gets a little warm during use.","So, in my opinion, the heat is not really a problem with this laptop.For all the ports and drives it has (floppy, serial, paralell, VGA, and the usual rest) it is very compact and light.","There are no ports on the back of the computer so you can open it wide.","Or just hook up the USB 2.0 device to your USB port if the data speed is not such an issue (such as with backups).Here are my only cons about this laptop:1.","Whenever I have this computer, I always have a book to read from the wide library of inexpensive or free books that I can download from the Internet.* GPS: If you install a GPS program like DeLorme and use a simple GPS antenna attaches to the computer through your USB port, you will have an excellent GPS system for your car that has all the same features including voice directions that a dedicated car GPS has.","A firewire port would also be nice.","I can sit in bed with the lights off and play poker, surf the web, or write with no problems.The ports (of which there are many) are well placed, and seated extremely well (my old G3 shed ports like a molting emu).","Great if you are stuck in a hotel and need to play on something.- Loads of USB ports.","Most others will take up 2 ports worth of space.Overall I am very pleased with this product and would upgrade to an Averatec laptop again in the future.","With time, this is sure to break off, maybe after a year or two.Sucka is heavy and a bit slippery - hold on tight to it or SPLASH goes [$$$].IR port is on CD drive, next to beautifuly done silver eject button; thus, I keep getting fingerprints and smudges on the IR.Nine thumbs and one pinky up on this notebook PC.Updated 07-March-2003:I\u0027ve had this for 2 1/2 months now and have not had any of the problems other people have mentioned.","My first one, an M35X-S161, constantly shut down randomly and a faulty AC port.","It\u0027s actually kind of difficult to get the volume adjusted to where I want it.*The USB ports have been moved around, and to me, they are not as convenient.","The cons are that it comes with fewer types of ports than other contemporary laptops.","Pros:-Very Powerful computer, handles anything-Large 15.4\" screen-3 USB ports, media reader slot, DVD burner-Great computer for the moneyCons:-Short battery life, sometimes less than an hour-I have a thin cyan line that runs down the screen for some reason, but it goes away if you tilt the screen-Wireless signal isn\u0027t as strong as other computers in the same house-Fairly heavy, big dimensions, and short battery life prevent it from being truly mobile Pros: Webcam, Fingerprint Reader, Remote control, TouchScreen, Microphone, 7 media buttons.cons: Speakers, Battery life, Heat GenerationThis gadget has been behaving good for 2 months and very recently it started making a stuttering static noise if I change the lid position.","Toshiba provides you with stickers with phone numbers on them for you to put on the bottom of your computer.The downside--2 of the 3 usb ports are in an unfortunate location.","Sony is most notable for their S and SZ series notebooks (13.3\" Screen), or their ultraportable T and TX series, so the FS series kind of has a lack of flare in comparison.PROS:-VERY CRISP screen with 1280x800 native resolution-Great number of ports on connections, including memory card reader-Very portable-Great pricing-Pentium M-Dual Layer DVD Burner-Battery Life is better than Toshiba\u0027s (I got 2.13hours... manufacturer claims 3 hours, but I had it with max brightness and Wi-Fi, so that\u0027s pretty good... 25% more battery)-100GB Hard DriveCONS:-Outdated processor, as well as not even top of the line-Only 512MB of RAM, and not even the fastest (only 533MHz... they make 667MHz)-Graphics Media Accelerator - uncommon in Sony notebooks, but not good for anything more than causal use nonetheless - GMA\u0027s use shared memory for its virtual memory, so you could get as low was 384MB of RAM remaining if the GMA kicks in.-Useless Sony programs - Sony has terrible program interfaces, erase them once you set up everything else on your computer-XP Home - You don\u0027t have much RAM, and now you\u0027ll have lots of spyware filling it up-Heavier than it looks - I weights roughly 6lbs, but judging by how thin it is, I would\u0027ve guessed closer to 5lbs.BOTTOM LINE: A step up from some of Dell and HP\u0027s buttom of the line notebooks with 40GB hard drives and 256MB or RAM, but not enough to justify a purchase, unless you want the mobile experience with the Sony name.","Not to mention the poor sensitivity of the touchpad, and, the horriblly designed ports (Network ports covered by flimsy cover)...The ONE thing that works for the laptop is it\u0027s looks ..","I had to buy Pinaccle Software and Accessories to hook the 3 pin connector from the Video Camera via USB port to my Laptop.","It has an IR port I find very handy (I use it for printing - no cables) But, you must go into the BIOS and \"activate\" it first.Battery lasts a long time, usually 2 hours or more, even under heavy usage.","Otherwise, Microsoft Works is included, as well as some graphics and other programs that I don\u0027t plan to use.The built-in wireless networking worked fine with no problems so far, and there is a port for ethernet network connection also, as well as a modem for phone line connection.All in all, I usually get a pretty accurate gut reaction to a new computer fairly fast, leading to me return them to the store on several occasions in the past.","Hace poco compr\u0026eacute;

No pun intended.)Apart from the battery life, which is only about 3 hrs - (fine by me); everything else works to spec.The best feature, which is somewhat hidden, is a dual display feature of the graphics card in the system - which means, if you connect an external monitor, you can use use the laptop display combined with the external display as an extended desktop.Screen is clear and images are really nice, haven\u0027t used the Ilink port so far.","My bluetooth mouse was found with no trouble.I need to get use to the ports all being on the left side and the CD on the right compared to the MacBook Pro.","The only people who should buy this laptop are the people who can shrug if they lose the thing.* There are limited ports.","even though I probably won\u0027t use it, but a finger print security scanner would be nice3. more USB ports (I think it has room for at least 2 more)4.","The four USB ports and built in WiFi allow me to do a wide variety of tasks.","However, this machine should have been given 32 or 64 megs of *dedicated* video RAM) Overall, this is a very good machine that would be a great machine were it equipped with onboard USB 2.0 ports, a little beefier video memory, and were it to weight a pound or so less.","The X-brite screen really stands out and makes everything so much sharper.I use it 12+ hours a day, with alot of burning DVD\u0027s and editing.I opted for the K-25 over the K-27 because it is essentialy the same but 2-3 hundred more for the CPU.My only complaint is the ports are not covered, my old Grx series had \"flaps\" that covered the USB/Firewire/etc... to keep out dust and debris....","The docking station adds a parallel port.","Ironically no serial port as well so you just cannot sync up a Palm with out additional USB device purchase.4.","I bought a USB mouse, and have two more ports that I can use.5.I like that the CD has DVD and RW capabilities.6.I like the design.","But Lion/Mountain Lion required too many compromises in certain key areas, the much vaunted HDMI compatibility was less than the dedicated PC out port our HDTV had, and a vintage Mac website had nothing but praise for Tiger on vintage hardware, especially when used in a period mid-2008 configuration.","I got used to my Macbook\u0027s magnetic power cord, so going back to worrying about breaking the port is kind of a bummer.","NEC did a good job with this one! With the improved battery life, the USB slave port, the flash ROM, OS, and the 400mhz processor NEC surely made a seller! Many people do not realize that this unit is not running Windows XP, so this unit can out speed most laptops with its operating system!People need to actually give HPC devices an honest chance, and with the right expectations.","Fortunately, it\u0027s not nearly as hot as my crappy Vaio.- There are only 2 USB ports, so I have to do some plugging/unplugging between my printer, scanner, and mouse.","The USB ports are not highspeed so the wireless network is slow and lacking.","I plugged it into a desktop monitor and was surprised to see it supported up to 1600 x 1200 resolution... and that was just in 32MB video mode.Pros:- The price.- Small and light, a notebook that is actually the size of a notebook!- Performance, no complaints here! 512MB RAM, 40GB HD, 64MB video, and fast enough for anything I\u0027m likely to do with it.- DVD+CD-RW combo.Cons:- The USB ports could be in a better spot.","This is the reason I gave it two stars instead of just one, just because the thing still works.- Glossy screen, which was somewhat uncommon back in 2004.- Good picture on screen.- Three (3) USB ports.- One of the nicest and attractive keyboards to date, in my opinion.Cons- Massive.","Good Points: Nice, Sharp ScreenBad Points: Flimsy port covers (my ethernet cover snapped off).","The touch pad also seems a bit more sensitive (my mouse will often pop around on the screen when another finger might accidentally touch it while scrolling).The only other downsides so far? Only one Firewire port (400).","I just wish Averatec would make a docking station/port replicator so it could function as a desktop.","It does have the lightweight MS Works, which is OK if you don\u0027t share files with others in business where it is almost never used.There are plenty of ports.","The cons: (1) it\u0027s heavy (in fact, it is a desktop replacement) and (2) the position of two USB ports (on the right side near the lower corner) is not convenient.","I\u0027ve had this laptop for about 3 years.I installed Windows 7 Home Premium and added an extra 1 Gb of Ram on it and it works great.The only drawbacks that I\u0027ve encountered are:-The trim on the laptop isn\u0027t very durable (plastic fades easily).-The fingerprint reader/software won\u0027t work with Windows 7-Battery life is lacking (less than 5 hours)The Pros:+Easy access to Hard Drive and Ram ports+Made in Japan+DVDRW drive+Lots of USB ports (5 total)This laptop is faster and more usable than a netbook.","I develop real apps on this)Quicker suspend and restart Never ever have to shutdown.3USB ports , one for your digital camera, one for keyboard and one for mouse1 iLink port for your camcorder15\u0026quot; display : great for a notebookJog Dial : Just a gimmick :-\u0026gt;Looks good, runs fast, but you need a cart to carry it around.love it... be the first one to buy it...","Have to remove a panel every time you plug into port replicator - can\u0027t leave panel off when using laptop alone - bad design flaw.HDD comes formatted in 2 partitions!

Good news is you can reformat and reload everything on 1 partition.Over all, excellent machine for the $$ ... - I\u0027d buy it again.","I\u0027ve had it for almost a year now and while it has certainly had some problems(it has shutdown after severely overheating about 3-4 times) I\u0027ve been pretty happy.My main issues with it are:- It overheats (I can\u0027t put it on my lap)- It only has 3 USB ports.","It has 3 high speed USB 2.0 ports, A firewire port, LAN and Phone ports, a 4-card reader (can read SD cards and Sony memory sticks...both of which I have), DVD/CD-Burner, Display Monitor port, Convenient 802.11G outside on/off slide switch.","It\u0027s very versatile for a superportable computer, so DVDs and gaming are certainly not out of the question.PROS- Very stylish and sleek looking- Superb display- Tiny- Has dedicated video RAM- Intelligently laid out (this is a huge point with me - all the ports are in useful places)- AC adapter is small and has a cool glowing light which will impress the kind of people who like glowing lights- Has a mute button (the speakers are OK, about what you\u0027d expect from a laptop)- Flawless wireless G integration- Battery life seems pretty goodCONS- Keyboard is bouncy and not too big (and requires Function keys for end, page down etc)- Included software is pretty much useless (but about standard for PC laptops), and comes with various advertisements (Actually, there are a few amusing programs for digital photography and media sharing among many VAIOs, but these are not exactly a hot selling point)- Some ports covered with plastic lids - this actually makes the system look very sleek when they\u0027re closed, but I\u0027m afraid that they might break off at some point, and they\u0027re kind of in the way when you\u0027re hooking things up (this could be either pro or con, really).- According to The Internet, Sony\u0027s customer service is not great, but I haven\u0027t had any problems yet and thus haven\u0027t had to contact them.","By the time I was through with a four-port USB hub, wireless mouse (which I found was unnecessary on trips, but great in the office), and the power cord (which you would think could be a lot smaller), it was less than the laptop, but I was still bringing a lot with me.","If you need additional USB ports, a simple USB 2.0 PC card can be purchased.","Is it a compromise? Well I guess for those who don\u0027t mind carrying around a 6 lb portable with all the bells and whistles or an ultraportable with slow processor, small keyboard but with more ports, I guess the MBA is.Where there is no compromise is in the speed, full sized keyboard, screen clarity and battery life.","The price for the logic (limited mobility laptop) and the fact that after 2 months, I went ahead and ordered an IBM thats half the weight, 4x the battery life and doesnt create enough heat to cook my lap are why it doesnt get 5 stars.Pros: nice bright screen, latest XP media center Operating system, number pad, ports and card readers for just about everything, good speakers.Cons: It\u0027s a BEAST to carry around, heat, battery consumption, sketchy mouse, lack of bluetooth, price.","You can enjoy high definition H264 videos, without drop frames.Ports -The MacBook Pro features 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, Gigabit Ethernet, audio in/out, and Expresscard (34 slot).Display - Apple touts the display on the new MacBook Pro as bright as the cinema displays, and there is no question: these displays are bright! Depending on your lighting condition, you\u0027ll almost certainly not turn the display to full brightness.","(no serial port though).Now the things that can be improved...First the extended battery is $299 list.","Get yourself an external speaker, such as aTRITTON SOUND BITE USB 2.1 PORT (TRI-UA201)if you want better sound.","Yes, this has been a bit annoying a few times (Especially since the Air has a disabled USB port turned off inside of it), but I have gotten around this by carrying a tiny USB splitter, and have needed to use that maybe 3 times total.I have to admit however that I also have a full MacPro, which I keep all of my files on and that the Macbook Air is my portable office.","Once that is done, initial start up times increase by about 75%.PROS: Amazing screen, fast graphics, superb keyboard, lots of ports, built-in webcam, fingerprint reader, etc.CONS: One major one (at least for me) is that the audio out ports are both located on the front of the unit.","Started getting blue screen of death, a USB port stopped working.","The laptop also supports 3 USB ports, built-in 56k modem, Ethernet, VGA out, headphone and mic jacks, and what I believe is an express card slot.The laptop is all plastic.","After a year my only concern is the fact that it runs hot if I am working longer than 8 hours a day with it (university use, programming) but I solved this little problem of mine with an additional fan pad you plug in via USB port.","There are only minor quirks, otherwise it\u0027s great! Once I have some more free time I\u0027ll try some games, such as a port of GTA San Andreas, and update with how they run and what happens to the MBP.UPDATE 2 on 4-11-2011:I decided that I would sell my month-old MBP on eBay and splurge on the high-resolution anti-glare version directly from Apple.","Otherwise you\u0027d have to close the lid and that would put it to sleep.The screen is high gloss but it hasn\u0027t been a problem and it\u0027s very bright even when using it outdoors.The built-in wireless networking is flawless and the bluetooth worked instantly with my cell phone.All the ports are nicely organized on one side of the machine and the DVD slot on the opposite side.The caps-lock and the num-lock keys are actually back-lit green.","The 2195 has better graphics, USB2.0 ports for quicker access to files on digital cameras and other devices, fire wire to load video from digital video cameras, more memory for video editing and playing games and an integrated 802.11g wireless network card.This laptop is bulky and heavy.","I travel a lot and take lots of digital pictures, so this is perfect in terms of portability and performance.Pros:Small form factorHuge hard driveGreat battery life (avg. 3 hrs)DVD burnerSD/MMC card readerExternal monitor supportCons:No floppy driveNo manual or support documentationNo original discs for installed software (for backup)No IEEE 1394 ports (FireWire) I own a dual core laptop with 2 gigs ram and a fast hardrive and was looking for something to take notes one, a small tabletthat was small enough to carry in my laptop bag with my laptop, but large enough to take notes on.So far this device has exceeded my expectations.I have taken notes on it for 2 days now with MSFT\u0027s onenote loaded.The machine keeps up with my writing.I loaded all of MSFT office enterprise edition on it for the fun of it and Lotus notes 7 for my corp email.I am trying the new windows live mail instead of using outlook for my personal email.","By phone I asked to buy a replacement port from Emachine, they refused to provide it.","For example, you cannot even change any BIOS settings (except date time/parallel port info and set passwords).","I could wish that I had a larger hard drive, but a friend of mine put together a 40-GB mini external HD (made from a laptop HD and a mail-order external case) that works great right through one of the 1500\u0027s USB 2.0 ports (without the need for any external power!).","You get both 802.11b+g wi-fi and Bluetooth built-in, as well as an i.Link port and a MemoryStick slot.","Those who use flash drives (jump drive, thumb drive) or other devices with thick USB plugs will only be able to use two simultaneous USB ports due to their tight proximity.7.","Looks VERY cool.Cons: No infrared (has the port built in, but its been disabled), at 1.4M not the fastest out there, 40 gigs is slightly smaller than others.Final note, I was debating between the toshiba m35 which was cheaper at the time than this,but the toshiba seemed flimsier and even though it had a bigger hard drive, it was not that appealing.","My only gripe about the volume and brightness buttons are that there is no on-screen meter for either -- so you don\u0027t know how low the volume is, or how bright the monitor is, you just have to hit min or max.The 3 usb ports are sort of scattered around the machine.","I have a couple of questions, first of all are there any other accessories such as battery pack, charger, storage case? What about serial and parallel ports? What about compatability with scanners, printers, gaming software, shipping charges? etc.","I guess buying a USB hub will do.- Too bad there is only space for one pc card slot- It would have been nicer if the ethernet port was in the back of the notebook so that the cord doesn\u0027t bother my left arm, but it\u0027s no big deal.- I hate support programs.","Within less than six months I had problems with the power port.","Just connect your monitor, wired or wireless keyboard/mouse and everything you should connect to USB/Firewire ports and you\u0027re done!- The keyboard as well as the computer itself it\u0027s veeeeery well designed to be used with your thumbs.","No Firewire port, no keyboard/mouse PS/2 ports.","You can easily keep it on your lap without feeling uncomfortable.My wish list for future MBA generations:- At least 2 USB ports.","It also has 3 USB 2.0 ports (2 lateral on the right, and 1 horizontal on the left - very useful for those chunky JumpDrives) and a Firewire port.","Some recurring issues in forums are: overheating issues, dead pixel (one) on the LCD (which some tech guy at a store told me is common on LCD screens, anyhow), smaller keyboard size (true enough, but it\u0027s not bad at all), sound system not being outstanding (come on, people, get a desktop for such extensive audio work!), and the Windows XP Home Edition that\u0027s pre-loaded (yes, really, DO upgrade to the Pro Edition, as it\u0027s less \"buggy\").BUT, what notebook is perfect? What other notebook has this much power, speed, battery power-saving capabilities (Centrino, baby), DVD-RW/CD-RW, Widescreen LCD screen display (you have to SEE to believe..it\u0027s SO beautifully bright that you can\u0027t help but be mesmerized and think \"purty\"!), 80GB storage capacity, firewire port, 4 USB ports, built-in wireless WiFi connectivity (get the Linksys Wireless router WRT54G for faster, more reliable speed), SD memory storage, and at 6 lbs., what else could you want? Think about it: what notebook doesn\u0027t have problems? They all do or will at some point.","It has all the ports that I need such as two USBs, serial, printer, and your audio and video ports.","That function works well, and is very convenient.The computer is quite well-equipped with ports; there are 3 USB ports, a VGA-out port, firewire, audio 3.5mm ports for headphones and microphone, as well as an SPDIF audio port.","It could have had the USB port on the side or the front but you get used to the rear location.","The various ports are well-arranged.","It has all the things I need - USB port, Ethernet port, internal modem, DVD drive - and it\u0027s very light and sturdy.","There aren\u0027t parallel, serial, or PCMCIA card ports - Sony isn\u0027t alone in dropping them as obsolete - but Sony made a big mistake in not including a HDMI output as they do on the FZ180 and up, and replacing Bluetooth with Sony-approved memory card slots makes no sense.","I can do all of this AT THE SAME TIME! Plus, if there is something I need to do in Windows, I just open up vmWare (optional software purchase...about $80) and have XP running my PC-only software.Mac is the best computer for those who are individuals (like me) who need a reliable computer that can handle just about everything you throw at it.The only downside I can see is that there is only two USB ports, but that\u0027s it.","In fact after a day with the machine, going back to my Windows Mobile 5 phone for a moment (HTC Hermes) felt like a major step back.A cheapo case and the port replicator come in the box - so don\u0027t feel the need to add them to your cart.I got the WiFi working immediately.","My initial concerns about possibly inferior Compaq quality (judging by my experience with their desktops) have been proven unfounded: this is a nicely crafted piece of machinery, good design, great ergonomics, solid, sturdy, ports nicely located, drive bays function well.","I do like the large amount of USB ports, but everything else is just standard.","There is no serial or parallel port, but the three USB 2.0 ports work well for attaching perhiperals.","My previous Port\u0026eacute;g\u0026eacute; laptops have been extremely reliable, over periods of more than 5 years of intensive use.In fact, my only major complaint is that, since I like to travel without the battery, to eliminate extra weight, this design does not allow the machine to be used normally without the battery in place: Two of the three feet under the front palm rest are actually on the battery itself, so removing it leaves the front area in mid air, and unstable for normal use.Still, very highly recommended as a travel laptop.","I have rather large amounts of data that I have to move in and out of it (from our production machines that do most of the heavy lifting), and having a FireWire 800 port is a godsend.","They always made great machines based on AMD processors, and this seems to be no exception.The 64-bit Athlon64 cpu delivers roughly the same power as a 3.2 Ghz P4, and not only that, it can run today\u0027s 32-bit applications as well as tomorrow\u0027s Windows for AMD64 (currently in beta) and today\u0027s 64-bit SUSE Linux 9.1 (which includes a fully ported 64 bit kernel).The video chipset is a \"real\" one, using dedicated video memory instead of \"shared ram\".The screen seems lovely for DVD playback, and the HD space is enough even for splitting in two and installing XP + Linux in a dual-boot configuration.Good-bye P4 notebooks...","No IEEE Firewire port and only 2 measly USB ports..","5 hours).The computer comes with 2 USB 2.0 Ports for endless expansion possibilities.","It also has a huge 15\" screen as opposed to the 14\" screens that most low-end laptops have.The main disadvantages of the laptop that I see are: (1) no serial port.","One thing I like about the power adapter is the keyed wedge like tip - it looks like this would make it more difficult for the laptop to develop the \"loose power port\" syndrome so many laptops suffer from.ApplicationsThe system is surprisingly snappy with Windows XP SP3 - Internet Explorer is the fastest browser on the laptop but security concerns and the speed benefits when on a slow internet connection have won me over to Opera web browser.","Two problems: one USB port does not work properly (the laptop does not detect the attached device) so I use it for the ventilator pad , and second: 256MB of RAM is really low, recomend upgrading to 512.","There are three handy USB ports on the right side.","With that in mind, I\u0027ll draw some comparisons between my 14\" Inspiron and the MB Pro.Here\u0027s my two cents:HARDWARE:* Peripherals:I think that for $2,000+ I should get at least 3 USB ports instead of just 2.","I hope that was not just a coincidence that time! Bottom line was that after 40 minutes T-S told me to completely re-load the software! I was going to do just that but decided to try reloading just the wireless drivers (after removing them), since the wired port and everything else worked just fine.","My Compaq Presario included two 2.0 USB ports and a 4 pin firewire (non powered).","The 3 USB ports are located on either side and far apart so that all three of them can be used simultaneously without getting in each other\u0027s way.","The only things that could be better are the speed (I thought AMD Turion 64 was faster) and the position of the LAN and modem connectors and the USB ports because they are not in the back but on both sides.","(I do know people for whom the weight is not a big issue and who want more horsepower and ports and sometimes screen size, especially for games.","I bring and use it at the hospital everyday.Pros:-inexpensive (comparing it to other companies with equal specs)-highly portable (do not need the 3.5 or CD-ROM drive everyday)-beautiful screen-hasn\u0027t crashed in 3 months (I\u0027ve pushed it pretty hard- huge multimedia powerpoint presentations)-always get looks from people-all the ports I need-Jog Dail-feels sturdy-great multimedia softwareCons:-Only copies to CD-RW disks-Battery life about 3 1/2 hoursI always read negatives about the Sony Tech Support.","This is a huge step for us consumers and something that is being shadowed by a few of the programs that have not been ported to run on the Intel driven Mac yet.So, take all the things the MBP offers right now, even with its short comings in Rosetta and I think if you are edcuated you will find that it\u0027s true.","my windows laptop has not been turned on..make sure to get parallels or vmware for any apps that are not mac ready.. with that you can safely do what you needmoving from outlook to mac cal and mail is a bit of a chore if you have lots of folders, attachments etc.. lost a lot of my attachments by doing an imap upload to a local mail server then using the mac to get them all.. not all lost but too many to go and count to give a %amazing video/audio for skype and iChatbattery rockssleep feature hands down kicks anything MS did on any hardware PCwould have like more usb ports or expresscard like in the promiss the finger print swipe from my HP 6400..white palm rest gets dirty and needs to be cleaned with mr. clean magic eraser once about 3 monthsoverall..","This is such a hassle when you use a mouse.- Placement of the headphone port on the mid-right side.","It\u0027s got a huge, full subwoofer (in place of a secondary HDD port) that has SO much potential for loud volumes, but alas, it doesn\u0027t perform.","If you\u0027re going to be using your Powerbook, for more than basic consumer tasks, you will want to add more memory.Graphics - The 15-inch Powerbook now features 128MB of video memory standard, and the ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 card allows you to connect your 15-inch Powerbook to beautiful, big, displays such as the Apple 30-inch cinema display.Ports - The 15 inch Powerbooks have a great array of ports.","- A firewire port is very common these days- This particular baby heats up too quickly- The touchpad is insensitive and irritating- The design is about 10 years behind what\u0027s on market- There is nothing about this machine that calls for the steep price A flawless machine.","Blue screen FTW!- No dvi port.","Acquired a Bluetooth MAC mouse which immediately worked, this saved me the need to use one of the 2 USB ports.","(My Dell\u0027s USB ports were stacked above each other, and it was sometimes hard to get things plugged in and out.)","Also, most Windows laptops do not offer a DVI port but the Macbook allows you to use DVI with an option $20 adaptor - this was another thing that sealed the deal for me.","3 USB ports, no unnecessary Parallel, Serial or PS2 ports.","The 2 USB ports are not enough and in general there are not enough ports.","In fact, I have no digital entertainment files on it since these files can fill up the (limited) space on the drive quite fast.- Ports: One USB port is not enough! For instance, if you have to connect to the internet via USB adapter (again, still indispensable!), you block the one and only USB port - unless you carry a USB hub along (Belkin has a nice 4-port one with a swivel design, but quite pricey).","Three USB ports in the rear with the capacity for 2 Type II cards or 1 Type III card in the side.9.","Co-workers with T61 report fewer problems with hibernate and transitions from their port replicators.","Considering that this notebook is targetted for the audio/video presentation users, quite often utilizing memory intensive programs like \"Photoshop\" as well the latest software for digital scanning, the performance would most likely be better with more memory allocation capability.* The \"home\" key is just to the right of the backspace and is an ergonomic disaster when quite often backspacing will brush and activate the \"home\" key that will put your cursor a mile away from when you wanted to.* The jog wheel is again a brain-dead feature that\u0027s useless.* Considering the obnoxious hard-disk, one could have at least configured an external drive to be used....but again out of luck because there is no additional USB port.* Adding additional drive is a big problem and again SOOONNNY flunked in the design department because additional storage is not designed in the expandability department.PROS :Other than the big screen, the new laptop offers very little functional features.Suggestion : Bypass the GRX series and wait at least for improvements.","An additional issue is that the unit lacks a serial port.","The HP gave me speed and price, and I don\u0027t mind carrying it around.I\u0027m also very impressed with the layout of where the put the latches, buttons, ports, etc.","While Apple did upgrade the USB ports (2) to USB 2.0, the only Firewire port is at the slower speed.","I\u0027ve had more parts fail in my desktop computers than I have with this laptop (which is actually a desktop replacement system given it\u0027s got a 2.4Ghz Pentium 4 processor, 2GB of RAM, 160GB HDD, 802.11g/b wireless, CD/DVD burner, four USB 2.0 ports and a FireWire (1394) micro port, and an ATI Raideon Mobility 9600 with 64MB Video RAM).","In 1999 I bought a VAIO desktop Digital Studio Desktop (455Mhz) , and it never let me down, actually we are still using it now at home.The laptop, when at home isconnected to a Sony DCR-TRV310 Digital 8 camera via ilink, a Sony DRX-510UL USB and Ilink DVD+-RW/+-R, and a western digital WD1200B007 external Hard disk.With 3 USB ports, a Ilink , 2 PCMCIA and Memory stick , compostive video out, audio out this laptop is great for multimedia.Three sore points :-There is no built in Microphone, just a mic input-Finding a connector to hook up the Component video directly to TV is something I am still pursuiing.- As a real road warrior, I carry this laptop in a roller due to its weight.Battery is acceptable, but not extraordinary.I could not find a docking station, which would have come handy.I use a laptop stand/Lap platform to prevent heating problems, as the main fan outlet is underneath.The Keyboard is a real natural.","It has 20gb hd, 256mb ram, dvd/cd-rw combo, iLink, 3 usb ports, smartmedia slot \u0026amp; nvidia.","I don\u0027t even miss the Ethernet port, as I travel with an Airport Express, and have for years.","The free docking station is a great help with the extra ports.","Having spent a week abroad with my GRX550 (15\u0026quot; screen) I can tell you this machine is a joy to work with for web and desktop apps.Watching DVDs is great, for the best in sound quality though be sure and get a SONY SRS-T77 speaker set to plug into the notebook, this little set of 4 watt speakers will rock the room and are small enough to fit into your bag and port along.As for validating other comments I\u0027ve read I\u0027d suggest:Size, yes the dimensions are a bit larger and I too bought a new bag - happily.","I bought this model in September and have been extremely pleased with it except for one thing: the USB ports do not work.","The AV has 3 USB ports, the iBook has 2 but also a IEEE 1394 (Firewire) port.","There\u0027s no serial or parallel port attached, which are useless to me.- Multi-tasking functions much better on a Mac.- Mac OS is also fun to use.","BTW, the AC adapter adds almost another pound to the travel weight.3) 3 USB ports, 1 IEEE-1394 port, SD card slot, built-in mic, built-in 802.11g support, wow!

Amazon won\u0027t let me lower the rating, I wouldn\u0027t give it more than 2 stars...For all that the tx1220us should be with the fast dual-core AMD processor and 2 GB of RAM - the system overall seems to be very slow.","The keys are comfortable to type on and have a good tactile response.You\u0027ll almost surely give up some connectivity (i.e. ports) if you choose this over a PC, but I don\u0027t regret my decision one bit.","It has four USB 2.0 ports on it that are placed far enough apart to accomadate larger USB Drives simultaneously.","How many of us have only two devices we want to plug in to the PC?The ports are in back of machine with a flexy plastic hingy thing.","In a corporate setting, the optional port expander is a useful accessory.Amazon carries several configurations of the T22, with different combinations of CPUs and screen sizes (900 MHz/14.1\u0026quot; versus 800 MHz/13.2\u0026quot;) and operating system (Windows 98 versus Windows 2000).","Still, you still have to look for a firewire port, not all camcorders have them.Hopefully, you found my review helpful.","NO PS/2 or SERIAL port.","An IrDA and an SVideo ports are not there for anyone of you that might need them.6.","There is a on off indicator for the mouse and wireless.I don\u0027t like the way connection ports are on the sides and on the front is the audio.","Personally I\u0027ll be sticking to the mac for a long time!Some downsides on this mac:- Only 2 usb ports- They keys quickly get shiny in high usage places and look opaque on others.","Luego de decidirme por adquirir una computadora port\u0026aacute;til, comenz\u0026eacute; a investigar a trav\u0026eacute;s de la red.","Two USB ports on the side of the machine are very close to the optical drive, which means you need to route cables to the back or the other side if you\u0027re going to be burning a lot of discs (which I frequently do).","I also like having 4 usb ports and that they are located 2 on the right, 1 in back and 1 on the left with enough space to actually use all of them if need be.","Price did not include any \u0027extra\u0027 software other than that installed on base model.Mine: PIII at 1.2 Ghz, \u0027M\u0027 cpu that offers step down to 800 mhz when on batteries, 30 gig hdd, 512 megs memory, legacy ports,1 usb is 1.1, 2 PCMIA slots, 56k modem, 10/100 ethernet, 16 meg ATI Radeon Mobility AGP video card, AC power adapter, \u0027new\u0027 leather carrying case, floppy drive and cable, Combo DVD Rom/ CD +/-RW.","Plus, there are more than enough ports (2 PCMCIA, 3 USB, 1 iLink, Network, Modem, A/V out, VGA).The harmon/kardon speakers and subwoofer are also top-notch.","Currently, my screen is going out and pieces have fallen out of my printer port.","It has a few shortcomings such as just 2 USB ports, and it gets too hot due to the metal frame.","Nearly everything about it is solid and well-designed, from the location of the ports to the mechanism that opens and closes the screen to the feel of the keyboard when you type.","No Bluetooth; No even Infrared port is included! What\u0027s the heck?! Hey, Acer Corporation you should name it BAREBONE ASPIRED because it is barebone inspired?! Can you imagine a hand with 1 or 2 fingers missing? That\u0027s how this laptop feels like because of the missing basic features such as Infrared port, FireWire, S-Video!At least Acer kept in laptop phone jack (dial-up for internet) and network jack. :)So, if you can live without such basic features as IR port, FireWire, S-Video, it will be acceptable purchase.","TWO THUMBS AND BIG TOES UP,I WILL DEFINITLY SHOP HERE AGAIN, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. i would recomend this laptop because it has a good system plus it came with extra stuff so get it I would recommend this labtop to anyone..It is worth every sent.The hp imprint finish is really nice.Hp really takes pride in manufacturing their items..From first glance you are attracted to the beauty and layout of this labtop..its really a special edition as printed....It is really fast.programs install so fast that sometimes you don\u0027t even see the progress bars.The graphics is supberb.I run a lot of graphic and cpu intensive programs like audio editing,video editing,dj mixing.And amazingly I can run all those programs simultaneously without any drop in system performance.and still have an anti virus scanning.the new Intel centrino duo really lives up to its name.you can really do more....the mobile remote fits in the pcmia slot so you can never lose it.The ports at the side are very useful.like the hdmi.Webcam works great and the finger print reader works nice to......I don\u0027t know why one reviewer said that it doesn\u0027t have blue tooth but this one has it as advertised and it works great..And its just the perfect viewing size to at least watch movies and have a couple of windows opened up at the same time.I give this series a full 10 because I haven\u0027t found a single problem with it.","In addition, this laptop includes plenty of connections: 4 USB ports, a VGA video output, a TV output, HDMI output, an expansion card port, gigabit Ethernet, modem, and what looks like a small FireWire port.","I can\u0027t say the price here.originally aim for presario 1520us. it has faster processor, more RAM, bigger hard disk, and firewire port.","the sony laptop has no infared port, no SD, SC, CM or other flash memory card slots.","No iLife, no superdrive, 4 port iLink inferior to 6 port Firewire.","The ports are on the side, no more reaching behind to plug it in.","The design of it prevents it from opening as wide as I\u0027d like it when I\u0027m holding it on my lap.- All the ports are on the sides (not on back) and there is no easy single connector docking port on it.","However, personally, I don\u0027t like where all the input/output ports are located.","my son\u0027s Christmas ruined because of you Where is my COMPUTER I will not give you guys a good review until you give me my laptop!!!PRONTO!!!

Although it does have some good points, like a very nice display, and USB ports EZ access, there are some serious faults with this machine.","Because this is a 12.1\" laptop, the keyboard is a but scrunched, though surprisingly not too bad! The battery extends out a little in the back, but not too much.There are 3 USB ports located on the right side of the laptop, next to the CD/DVD writer, with the power plug at the rear of the right side.","The 3 USB ports are handy; I\u0027m only using about 2 at a time for my flash drive and wireless mouse.","I have three children, ages 11, 2 and 5 months, and a husband who thinks that banging on the buttons will make it work faster!

I have tried to buy this product from EXPRESS SOLUTIONS twice, both times after a lengthy delay, they told me the product was unailable, however in the meantime my credit card had been charged.The credit card was refunded, however they caused much inconvenience, waiting for a product that in the end never showed up.They are a disgrace and should not be allowed to trade on AMAZON.","I also like the location of the USB ports on this computer.","A USB port is on both sides of the notebook.","Seems like there\u0027s not much information about it\u0027s compatibility, and some devices are unlikely to work, like the modem and power management, but driver support for Sony is coming along nicely.Weight and battery life are issues to consider: if you\u0027re looking for a laptop you can use comfortably on a long flight, forget it unless you buy a power port adapter - on mine, batteries last for around an hour and a half with normal use.","I have always bought Sony and not just for my PC needs.I have never had a failure or issue with any of their product and would recommend this notebook to anyone looking for a nice light powerful PC.Only dislike I have is in the location of the external connection ports located at the sides of the unit.","There are no FireWire ports, but since I have no need for them, it doesn\u0027t matter.","However, in the one year I\u0027ve had it, the SD slot, the CD drive, and one of the USB ports are damaged (yes, I have kids).","It\u0027s 20 percent faster than the model it replaces and 20 percent cheaper, with a hundred-buck price cut and wireless networking included.The iBook features a brilliant, small screen, 4+hour battery, 4.9 pounds, an array of fast ports, industry-leading styling and the best repair record in the industry, according to Consumer Reports.","When I use an external mouse, I use a Bluetooth wireless model, so it doesn\u0027t take up the USB port.","The one I bought on 9/5/2007, sold by \u0026 shipped from Amazon.com, has an HMDI port (not DVI), and a fixed webcam (not a swivel).","USB ports on the left is incovenient for right-hand corded mouse users.","No InfraRed port for quick sync with Palm or other such devices.","I can\u0027t believe how much more screen space I have with a 15.4 inch screen (I had a 14-inch iBook) - it really does make a significant difference.The only thing I don\u0027t like is the position of the USB port and the firewire port on the right side.","Pressing the center of the bar works fine with even light pressure.Secondly, why only 2 USB ports? Seems like there is plenty of space for a 3rd or fourth port.The screen is great and I like the idea of the two video cards.","They do not have the proper cost benefit in my opinion.4) No IR port! I don\u0027t nee this, but I\u0027m sure others might (and I may need it in the future).5) Sucker is big compared to the newer laptops out there, although it still falls in the extremely portable category.6) VERY weak warranty.","I have used the IR port on ocassion as well.","I just bought an external keyboard iii) USB ports refuse to recognize my external mouse a lot of times.","It has every feature and port needed to meet all your entertainment needs whether it\u0027s downloading music or playing videos and the widescreen HD monitor looks as good as my Samsung HDTV.The only negative is with getting a 17-inch widescreen you also are getting 8 pounds of weight.","i got 256 RAM extra free of cost, so it is 512 now.Watching DVDs is great, for the best in sound quality though be sure and get a SONY SRS-T77 speaker set to plug into the notebook, this little set of 4 watt speakers will rock the room and are small enough to fit into your bag and port along.As for validating other comments I\u0027ve read I\u0027d suggest:Size, yes the dimensions are a bit larger and I too bought a new bag - happily.","I am still trying to understand why they have brought back the parallel port but not the serial port.My biggest issue is aesthetic.","Everything is in the back except the PCMCIA port and DVD/CDRW drive.","Pros:- the best 15.4\" screen I\u0027ve seen on a laptop, much brighter than the Toshiba M45 (though colors are slightly washed out)- thin and relatively light considering the specs- exceptional design, runs cool, very quiet- easy to upgrade hard drive, RAM, or battery- Sony\u0027s are known to be very reliable but if they do break down you might get the runaround from SonyCons:- lots of useless software pre-loaded that makes the system much slower than it should be- difficult to perform a clean install (instructions are vague on Sony\u0027s site) but the system is MUCH faster if you do- connectivity ports are on the sides rather than along the back of the laptop which can get messy- LCD emits slight humming noise when brightness is set at less than full (this is a known issue)- shared video memory (perfectly fine for typical tasks, not okay for games)- slow 4200rpm hard drive (though easy to upgrade to 7200rpm)- Sony\u0027s support isn\u0027t the best: long hold times, weak web supportConclusion:definitely check out the Fujitsu N3510 and Toshiba\u0027s M45, which both have similar glossy displays, though I think you\u0027ll find the Sony to be the leader of the pack.","It has 4 USB 2.0 ports on the right side so adding a mouse is no problem.Pros:Price vs Features (although it has gone up since I bought it), Processor Speed, HD Display Screen, HD Size, SuperMulti DVD player, Biometric reader, 6 USB 2.0!!!, all ports are on front and sides for easy access, attractive case, numeric pad on keyboard, rich sounding speakers, runs cooler on the bottom then my Dell laptops (heat is vented to the sides)Cons:Weight, AC Adapter converter is the size of a brick!, price of buying a second adapter is expensive.UPDATE: A couple of things.","I did find that my external hard drive was not recognized on the rear USB port but was on the side USB port, not sure why yet.","There are no serial or parallel ports but who needs them anyway? Battery life is on the short side but it recharges quickly.Another gb or ram will help and will be added, considering it is only a $100 upgrade.","I\u0027ll break my review into three sections; General Comments, Pros and Cons.General Comments:- Processor: AMD Turion 64 Processor TL64- Memory: 2GB- Screen Size: 15.4\"- Hard Drive 200GB- OS: Vista Premium- Video: Nvidia GeForce Go 7400Pros:- QuickPlay: Lets you play DVD\u0027s, Videos \u0026 Music without having to have the computer booted.- QuickPlay Buttons: Above the keyboard there are touch sensitive buttons for stopping, playing, pausing and volume levels while using QuickPlay.- QuickPlay Remote: Comes with a mini remote that stores in the ExpressCard port for use with QuickPlay.- USB Ports: It\u0027s got three USB ports which is good for most needs.- DVD+RW DL LightScribe Burner (What else could you ask for?)- Integrated WebCam/Microphone (Works good with Yahoo \u0026 MSN)Cons:- Preinstalled software, demos and junk!!! OMG, I was watching something on CNET and they were saying that new computers are overloaded with preinstalled software, but this is ridicules.","I bought this laptop and as soon as I got it, cleaned it up and installed my favorite Linux Distros, now I have 15GB for Windows, 7GB for Debian (my favorite) 7GB for Kubuntu (trying it out) and 1GB for a future installation of Linux From Scratch, the other 50GB are for my data.So far everything has worked well, except in kubuntu that I had to configure a \"vesa\" driver to get Xorg Working, but later updated to the ATI Driver and now, everythings works Great!!!The Only thing I miss is a PS/2 Port for an external optical mouse I have.","As a college student, this computer has proved to be fast and reliable, though the main two reasons why I didn\u0027t give it a 5/5 is because:a)It is pretty bulky by today\u0027s standardsb)No S-Video port (a must on most of today\u0027s computers, but it does have a VGA port so you can still manage to connect it to other audio/video devices).The speakers that the computer include are not that great, but I already had Z-680\u0027s so it wasn\u0027t a big deal.The graphics on this computer are pretty good, and it has a decent amount of memory.","Legend ports are found on the back.Battery life on the notebook is pretty good.","The touchpad requires very minimal pressure to operate, and the left and right control buttons are large and well placed.Three USB ports, one Firewire port, a parallel port, external monitor port, PCMCIA slots (2), and standard audio ports are provided.","I was one of those people who was like \"I\u0027M GONNA DOWNGRADE TO XP!!\" But never, when i use my desktop, i feel old using XP, lol.Pros:- VERY good looking- 1.3 mp webcam- Nice mousepad buttons- Touch quick buttons (have a con though)- DVD writer- 2 integrated mics- 2 headphone jacks- Not heavy (has a con)- Has a remote (for all the lazy people - only works for media center though)- Centrino- Intel Core 2 Duo processor- 160 GB space- 1 GB RAMCons:- Quick buttons beep when you touch them, and there\u0027s no way of muting them.- Not light- Speakers misplaced, when you close lid sound becomes unclear- Lid is fingerprint hog- 3 usb ports (i always thought a computer must have a minimum of 4 usbs)- 1.73 ghz processor- Short battery life- Does not have bluetooth!!That\u0027s all i can think of right now.","Also, the 3 usb ports on the side are close together, so either get a hub or get a skinny usb jump drive like the cruzer mini.","But you only have one USB port and no firewire ports.","it has all the ports you need, including an s-video out for connection to your tv, and four - that\u0027s right, count\u0027em - four usb 2.0 ports for hooking up peripherals.","I got the device and was very well pleased with it, however, it had no serial port! I like the device well enough to give it to my son, but I am disappointed with the product presentation by Amazon.","Also since the USB ports are so close together I cannot use the third port (usually the middle one) when the other two are being used.","Also, according to a few system information programs, it seems as if only one of the USB ports is actually USB 2.0.The one touch DVD feature sucks too.","Four USB ports should be enough for most users.All in all I get an Epson C86, USB cable and this laptop for $545 after all rebates which I think is a fantastic deal.","3) 4 USB 2.0 ports is never too many 4) Nice overall design and looks 5) Sound from Harmon/Kardon speakers is excellent and rich 6) Built-in WiFi reception is exceptional and very convenient 7) Easy to change/upgrade memory and hard drive with simple access doors(great design) 8) Scrolling feature on trackpad works very well 9) I don\u0027t use my desktop anymore.Cons: 1) Silver laptop finish scratches off easily 2) No Serial port 3) Screen can be brighter, more vivid and have better control 4) Requires 120w.","Surprised by no InfraRed - that\u0027s my biggest complaint as I really need to backup my Nokia phone thru an IR port.","There is a MiniPCI expansion port underneath with prewired antennae that route unseen through the LCD lid casing.","A 1 page documentation on the ports in the back.","My 3 biggest issues with this laptop are: (1) noisy fan, (2) no good port replicator/docking station \u0026 (3) no auto/air adapter.","I think it would be SO MUCH better to have the fan on the side and all the ports on the very back.","Though it is good, it cannot compare to the Harman/Kardon speakers on the M35.This laptop has the intel extreme graphics2, with 32MB (can go upto 64MB) of ram, whereas the M35 has a 32MB GForceGo, so in the bench this only scored a 1912 whereas the M35 scored a 3441.It does have 10/100 LAN as well as 54G wireless and 56K modem, 2 USB2.0 ports and a firewire port.","Also, the serial connector on a standard issue mouse is incompatible with the mouse port here, a real bummer.But I paid little more than $500, with shipping and a 90 day HP warranty included.","Also, there is a decent video card(ATI Radeon 64MB, good networking, and conveniently located USB ports (3 total).","Run Aperture on an Intel Mac? Amazing!As for non-universal applications; it was very well known that they would run slow: if you want to blame someone, blame Adobe who hasn\u0027t followed Apple\u0027s guidelines for programing (using Xcode) and now faces a big challenge porting the applications to an intel compatible version.","This new model Qosmio F25-AV205 has a 100GB hard drive, 1024 MB RAM, 3 USB ports and upgraded Harmon/Kardon Speakers.","There are 4 USB 2.0 ports and the SD card slot with I use to copy photos from my Pentax digital camera to the laptop.","Then the other two ports died.It\u0027s still usable, as long as you don\u0027t need to connect any USB devices, and don\u0027t mind the flawed display, but if I had it to do over again, I\u0027d buy something else!

I plug it into the little keypad USB port and the fan is positioned on a flexible, positionable rod and provides enough air circulation to keep me comfortable but doesn\u0027t blow my paper around the office.","As far as the port limitations go the only thing i use is audio jack, usb, and ethernet at school but there\u0027s wifi too.","EXCELENTT NOTEBOOKHI-TECH PRODUCT FROM TOSHIBA THAT\u0027S A REFERENCE OF NOTEBOOKS IN THE WORLD.NICE COST/BENEFIT, CONSIDERING THE MARKET OF NOTES.ONE GOOD POINT IS 4 USB PORTS.","I have had a few challenges getting the ($349) FireWire drive to work property with Norton\u0027s Ghost 2006.I do most of my serious typing with the UX280 while it\u0027s in the port replicator and connected to an external display, keyboard and mouse.","It has only 2 USB ports, using 3rd USB port will block your speakers.3.","The DVD buttons above the keyboard turn it from a great laptop to an easy very portable DVD player.Comes with plenty of ports (USB, Ethernet, etc.)Some people may not like the fact that Sony is partial to their own stuff and only has their memory stick drive and doesn\u0027t include the standard one.","I used the Amazon information to go by, and one thing that I was specifically looking for was a serial port, as many of the applications I run require a serial port connection.","It\u0027s not worth it to spend $400+ to get the Toshiba external DVD/CD writer - I have my desktop for burning dvds/cds.You can also buy a Toshiba wireless bluetooth mouse and use the built-in bluetooth to decrease clutter and free up a USB port.","I moved from a 15.1 to this 12.1 and I\u0027m OK.Non-issues:-Lack of a printer port - c\u0027mon, buy a new printer.","There are more cutting-edge machines out there, but why pay so much when you can get a computer that will meet your needs for about half the cost of today\u0027s PowerBooks?This model also has 2 FireWire ports, making it 100% compatible with that new iPod you\u0027re dying to try out ;) I love the earlier kit from Ultra-cord which I have owned for over a year.","The USB ports instantly recognized and \"sync-ed\" with my PDA, digital camera, and USB flash drive upon connection.","First the good things.The thing is small and light and fits in almost any carry-on bigger than a purse.Battery lasts forever 6 hours playing DVD or games is routine.No port-replicator is needed.Wireless works well.Now, the less good things...The keyboard is a bit cramped for big typing jobs.The DVD isn\u0027t the smoothest player of movies etc, but it isn\u0027t bad.Would I buy another? Absolutely.","Luckily, Amazon accepts returns, but I\u0027m out $10 for shipping it back.I called Sony and was told they do not make a port replicator for this particular notebook and was told since they haven\u0027t by now, they more than likely will never.Best Buys has this port replicator listed on their site as one of the accessories available for the Vaio FS980.I ended up buying a top of the line \"generic\" replicator by Kensington which supports flat screens up to 19\" (cost $180).","It is definitely not as good as IBM\u0027s casing.12) It has 3 USB ports, headphones and external mic jack.","It has 2 PC card drives, about 4 or 5 USB ports, a parellel port, and more.","I think also it needs to have 3 USB ports!! the two on board are kinda close some fatter USB devices will prohibit you from plugging in 2 items, my thumb drive is a little fatter so then I can\u0027t have my house plugged in, I will probably get a portable hub but my old windows laptop had 3 USB and they were located apart from each other and one was on the right side, which would be nice for some of the short corded laptop mouses for right handed people.","The technical specs are great (baring the lack of DVD drive, FW and only one USB port - but if you wanted that, then why buy a \"cool\" computer) and the running speeds are brilliant.","People look at it and say \"wow\".But, why would anybody pay more than $2,000. for this computer when a machine (even a laptop) with larger capacity, bigger screen, more USB ports, more memory, larger hard drive, better warranty and less expensive parts can bought for much less?The answer is: a footprint smaller than a letter sized sheet a paper; full networking; a built in CD/DVD drive; built in fingerprint reader; bright, high resolution screen; a seven hour battery life even when networked; more than adequate memory and hard drive suitable for all but heavy graphics; the ability to play DVD\u0027s without starting up Windows and a total weight of less than 3 pounds.My first concerns were: Can someone with \"older\" vision and reflexes actually read the screen and use the keyboard?I found that, although bright and clear, the screen is definitely small.","i read a lot of reviews and was thinking of returning this but it worked alot better then i thought it would had it almost 3 months withou a problemthe wireless signal strenght was not good out of the box but once i updated through windows update it doubled and i am getting the same signal as my dell picture is great very fast cpu does not get as hot as i thought it would very light and appealingonly bad thing is definitly the speakers I read a lot of reviews on the Web complaining about MacBook Air single USB port, lack of built-in Ethernet port, external SuperDrive, etc. as major issues...","I also noticed that AVG Firewall was notifying me of many unknown processes that would randomly request ports.","This can be taken care of by using up one of the 3 USB ports and a USB to serial conversion cable.","You even get an HDMI cable for easy, 1-cable hookup to your HDTV or A/V Receiver.Shears_\u003eIf both the devices have HDMI port, you may use a HDMI cable.G\u003eThat\u0027s what I thought.","It\u0027s a different philosophy but it works for me! That way every 3 years I\u0027ve spent $700-800 max on a laptop and I can move on to a new one if mine dies.Oh also, this laptop doesn\u0027t run too hot like many out there - I love that fact and the fact that it has so many useful ports (firewire, multiple usb, s-video, etc).I should note this was my first ever laptop.","They include XP or windows 98and 12 or 20 GIG harddrive on board, more than enough for most applications, with USB ports in back or side of the note bookWhilest its not the newest or fastest machine out in stores.. it does get you online and handles just about anything with ease, plays your movies/DVDs and is a great computer to bang around without worrying too much!for $100 and change its a great deal!eric I included an extra memory order to be able to use this computer, nevertheless, Vista exasperated me soon.","It is fast, blessed with a great screen, has every port you could possibly want, and even has a swift DVD burner to boot.","It\u0027s fully loaded with wifi, bluetooth, PC card slot, firewire port, 2 usb 2.0 ports, ethernet, modem, DVD+-RW (mine wasn\u0027t just CD+-RW/DVD-ROM).The machine physically looks great if you\u0027re into aesthetics.","QUALITY: Solid overall build, some flimsy plastic port covers that must be used with some care.","There is also a serious lack of USB ports.","In addition to that, it sports a USB 2.0 (for connecting all those Wintel things, plus iPods), a FireWire 400 port (can be used with older Macs, and many HandyCams), and 802.11 (\"Airport\") connectivity (b/g/n).","Barest minumum of ports requires dongles and a usb hub.While its slower than my Macbook pro, the only times I really notice a difference are:- Booting the machine takes longer (but I usually only do that a couple times a week)- Starting some applications takes longer (but once started I can still run a LOT of apps in 2gb even including Parallels)- True multitasking is limited to one intensive disk or cpu operation at a time (don\u0027t try and use the machine for anything significant while doing a backup, or while ripping a DVD).So under normal use I was very pleasantly surprised how useable the AIR felt after being used to a PRO.","It only has two USB ports, and could certainly use more of those.","I simple want a power port replacement for my laptop, which has been inoperable for almost six months.","In the first week, I noticed the USB ports would stop working if the computer went into sleep mode.","Nice for presentations.-Built in ports (USB, Card reader, VGA, S Video, IR - came with remote, etc...)Take it or leave it:-Touch pad.","There is a usb port on each side which is nice.","Then one of the USB ports stopped working.","Also for a time I had SuSe Linux 8.0 dual booting no problems except it ran very hot, uninstalled it because with a 20GB hard drive things got cramped real fast.I started out with 8mb video and 256mb RAM and upgraded to 32mb video \u0026amp; 512mb RAM, bought the port replicator and a PCMCIA-USB 2.0 Card and have been using my 2700US as a desktop relacement for a little over a year now flawlessly, except for a problem using an external monitor until I upgraded the video driver for dual monitor support.","somes times a week without it, or maybe 3 in a day, i also encounter the blue screen of death a lot...(the microsoft crash) which SHOULD be very rare on an XP machine.the keyboard layout is nice, when you get it it takes alittle time to get used to, but i type just as fast on this as a normal keyboard.there are 2 usb ports, they are on the right side of the laptop so it makes using a mouse very akward.This laptop is SO powerful and small, so its only natural that it would get hot, and when it gets hot the fan goes on...overall its average... but for the price i\u0027d go withsomething else I have used this machine for a month now and am fairly satisfied with the overall performance.","Consider a USB hub, or the T60/T61 which has three USB ports.","It\u0027s fast enough for my needs, good hard disk drive, three USB ports, wireless integrated and battery lasts long enough for me.","First of all, let me say that I paid the 1500 dollars in September, before they changed all the iBooks to G4s and the USB ports to 2.0 .","Also the USB port on the left side doesn\u0027t work, although the one on the right does.Right now, I can\u0027t afford to buy another computer.","Battery life last for about 4 hours (without using CD) - I tried to set the power management but still can\u0027t reach 5 hours as spec.But one thing that bothers me is a plastic cover on the ports.","Door covering the ports seems like it would be easy to break.","I just discovered a device to connect analog video to the USB port on the Macbook as well.With the built wireless access, you will never realize how much you previously gave up by being tied down with desktop computers.Thank you Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Andy Grove! The 2006 Macbook is truly a winner! I have been searching for a laptop for one month, finally I decided to purchase this model.","The only reason you wouldn\u0027t like a dedicated nVidia or ATI card (besides the nVidia 6150) is if you plan on being on the road almost all the time because dedicated cards do use more power.Exterior: There are plenty of ports here so I never have a problem.","I love the fact that is has 4 USB ports (no need for a USB hub unless you\u0027re connecting a whole bunch of stuff).","There\u0027s no firewire port.","The availability of a port replicator was a requirement in my selection process (so you can leave printers and other peripherals plugged into the dock).","For something that is so small, it has all the port connectors I would use; firewire, usb, vga, ethernet, and a magicgate port to boot.","REAL SPECS:1.83GHz Core 2 Duo T5600 (NOT 2.0GHz!!)1GB (2x512mb) 533MHz RAM200GB HD @4200RPMDual Layer DVD+/-RW (NO BLU RAY!!)nVidia 7400GT 256MB (NOT 7600!!)1440x900 resolutionPROS:-Fast processor - not the fastest, but good enough-Monster hard drive - 200GB is insane!!-1GB RAM - I call it 1GB the sweet spot-DVD burner - dual layer, multi-format-Bright screen - viewable in most lighting, great for watching movies-Good media controls-Good keyboard-Good trackpad-Webcam-Tons of ports/connections-PCI-Express card-Vista compatibleCONS:-Mediocre battery life - I got about 2.5 hours (on average).","Would still recommend.I purchased this laptop and feel very satisfied with all the features, it even has a 56k modem for dialup (unfortunately my only option where I live).Some of the features not listed above are a LAN connection plug, 3usb ports, headphone jack, microphone jack, plus S-Video and SVGA output.It was very easy to set up; it recognized all my add-ons, ergonomic usb keyboard, wireless usb trackball, usb multifunction laser printer, 2 usb hubs, and an emergency usb controlled battery backup.","I hate touch pads (and all T-series models, starting with T30, come with both TrackPoint *and* touch pad), I need three mouse buttons, serial port and both CD-ROM and floppy disk.","Both sport sharp 12.1\" 1024-by-768 LCD, 256 MB memory and 32 MB graphics memory, FireWire 400 and USB 2.0 ports, and 100/10 fast Ethernet.","Ethernet port ceased to work.5.","great- Card Reader - Although limited, still great- Carbon Fiber Casing - Very sturdy- Excellent ports and connections for size- Stays cool - Quiet fan when it heats up, doesn\u0027t ever get too hot that it become uncomfortable- Bluetooth/Wi-FiCONS:- Expensive - Perfection comes at a price- Not as thin as expected - Kind of a thick case for the screen size, not as thin as the MacBookI almost advise going to SonyStyle.com just so you can configure the 2.0GHz processor, but other than that, if they price is irking you, Sony has an outlet store online, and they offer this and many other laptops with 1 year waranties if it\u0027s refurbished.","The T43 can come in various configurations, and it comes in two different screen sizes (14.1 inch and 15 inch).This laptop gets pretty hot after 30 minutes or so.Two USB ports is a little skimpy for some people.","It is extremely bright and sharp, making pictures and video seem much more vivid than on other screens...while also allowing text to be more readable at higher resolutions.My only complaint are the covered usb and networking ports.","Update: I attach the WD Passport and the printer to the USB port on the Time Capsule with a USB mini hub (not a powered hub), store videos on the Passport and back up the Air and Passport with Time Machine to the Time Capsule\u0027s hard drive.","So this laptop sucks for multitasking.-P4 processor does not support hyperthreading-40gb on the hard drive is a limiting factor nowadays-would like to see more usb ports, and a stereo line-in port-slow and featureless video card, so fairly useless for gaming-included software is almost worthless in my opinion as there is a lot of way better software out there that can even be free, and the recovery thing is frustrating tooand last but not least:-SONY\u0027S CUSTOMER SUPPORT ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!!! I will not explain the issues I had with their support, since it would take forever, it\u0027s a very long and frustrating story.Conclusion:-----------Would not buy a sony laptop again.","The machine has more ports and slots than I have ever seen on a mid-range laptop-including a 6-in-1 digital Media Reader for memory cards.","Under any circumstances, with only two USB ports, either a port replicator or, at a minimum, a USB hub would be needed.","At first I was surprised that there were only two USB ports, but I can\u0027t imagine a time where I will need more than two.","Now the external speaker port is screwed up and only plays sound on one side of the speakers or headphones.","Mine came with Vista and its a little harder to get used to but it is improved in some areas over the XP.\u0027Virtual Reality Delivered\u0027 GeForce Go Graphics, dedicated video memory deliver advanced 3D Graphics for ultra-realistic gaming and video effects.17 Inch High Definition Brightview Widescreen displayHDMI port, high definition output to your flat screen TV.This is a great laptop and has a lot of different features you would love.","Ports hidden in flip down tabbed covers which will break off -very very cheap.","The speed at which this machine handles 4 or 5 programs at once is nothing short of amazing!

Even better, I\u0027ve plugged my old display into the video port, using it to extend my desktop across both monitors.","Once computers go through their major leap, which hopefully won\u0027t be TOO long, no computer will have integrated graphics, but just because of this graphics card, this item must lose a star.-No Webcam or Bluetooth - Not important, just disappointed they\u0027re not offered.-Wasted space - There could be more ports on here.","Good Speed, plenty of Ram to start off with 256mb(with one extra empty slot for more)upgradable to 1gb NICE..But I find only two things wrong with this notebook, first the specs on amazon state there\u0027s a 1394 firewire port , sorry but there isn\u0027t.","The ports are easily accessible on the side, the slot-load drive means that you won\u0027t have a tray that can break or become jammed, and the instant sleep/wake function from operating the lid is invaluable.","I primarily use a mini-mouse through one of the USB ports which are conveniently located on either side of the machine--very convenient and allows me to configure the notebook to best fit whatever impromptu workspace presents itself.","That said, a simple plug-in of a set of speakers will rectify that.All this, and throw-in IEEE1394, 3 USB, infrared, SmartMedia, LAN, modem and parallel ports, and the whole package is sewn-up nicely.","I mean why would you even have to limit the bandwidth of the firewire port? that\u0027s just damn crazy!The good news is that I scored a firewire PCMIA port and hooked it through there, so everything is good......But if you\u0027re not into video editing, this is probably one of the slickest laptops available in this price range.Thanx, SONY! I recently converted to Mac from Windows, and this is my first Mac.","To add to the confusion on the USB ports, mine says USB 2.0 and I was able to transfer videos (1 minute to transfer for a 1-minute video clip) from my Mini-DV camera to the laptop through the USB.The fan switches on and off periodically.","PROS:-Small/compact-Fast processor - 2.0GHz - Core 2 Duo is brand new-2GB!! of RAM - impressive-Gorgeous screen-Massive 120GB hard drive-DVD burner-5-in-1 memory card reader-Multimedia controls-Comfortable keyboard-Bluetooth-Plenty of ports and connectsCONS:-Above average weight - 4lbs is pushing the ultracompact weight-Integrated graphics - for some, a deal breaker, especially with the SZ running a hybrid PCI/integrated carding system-Battery life - Great, but not compared to its competition.","This also has 3 usb ports on it which is better than average.","If anyone knows how to use monitor-out port to make it tv-out port, please let me know at boevik9000@hotmail.com I really like this tablet.","As always, Apple has continued the tradition with the Mac unibody design + the new Thunderbolt port + quad-core i7 Intel chip, etc.","Amazon failed to mention that this notebook has an Ethernet port also.","Even that old laptop has built-in infrared port! SHAME ON ACER!!!I\u0027m wondering what Acer is going to do when build their next budget notebook model, hmm cut off built-in touch pad mouse?!OVERALL CONCLUSION: I would say it is an extremely budget laptop with a good processor (which is in the mid of Pentium M class) but not much too offer in features.","Sometimes I have to hard reset by holding the power switch to get it back.Access to the USB ports is easier on this system than the 260 (they are farther back) and the clumsy plastic doors are gone so plugging in ethernet cables are easier as well.","--Much better than a palm pilot -- it really is a real laptop that fits in your pocket--It only has 1 USB but I bought a USB expansion port thing that gives me 4 USB ports and plugged it into this thing and it worked great--I live in Canada and can not use the Cingular wireless built in...but I have a Telus wireless account with a Sierra cellular wireless USB card and can surf the net, get remote access from anywhere :) Great if you want to remotely administer your computers from handheld device -- but you have to remember to carry your wireless modem in another pocket.--I have full Office 2000, Internet Explorer 7, remote acess software, and everything running on it.","I was having immense difficutly with my USB ports.","The hard drive is very roomy and you can do photo and video editing with the input ports, drive space, memory and processor speed.","I appreciate having the choice of right or left hand USB ports.","It has all the features you would expect from a high end notebook, with an amazing display, DVD/CD-R combo, firewire port, and memory stick slot.","There\u0027s plenty of hardrive space (120gb), enough memory(1gb), it comes with a dvd writer, a fingerprint reader as an alternative for passwords, 3 usb ports, SD card reader, integrated wireless, an intel centrino duo processor... in summary, you cannot ask more for this price(much better if you get the rebate offer).","Also, the power supply has a right hand bend so if your power happens to be on the right, then you can\u0027t use that USB port that is right next to it.","I was surprised that there was no serial port for sync cradle of my PalmIIIXE PDA.(had to buy a $$$ USB Adapter plug that works slowly) I recently purchased the Qosmio laptop because it had a really high-end video, display, and processor.","I do want to point out that this unit does not have a IrDA infrared port.","I have not tested the speed of this, but with the specs, I would assume encoding isn\u0027t TOO much of a chore like in some of the slower Pentiums.- Tons of ports - Firewire, Infrared, S-Video, DVI-Out, 4 USB Ports!, etc.- XP Pro - no complaint there- 80% One Hour Charge - GreatCONS:- A little heavy- Some competition has better battery life- Although Core Duo, 1.66GHz is the slowest in the line (2.33GHz is the current fastest)- Not the best looking Notebook- Tends to get really warmBOTTOM LINE: ALthough not the most powerful notebook on the market, the best in this price range.","Pros* The 16.1\u0026quot;

I do agree with the reviewer who said it would be nice if one or two of the 4 USB ports were in the back, rather than having them all on the sides.","There are only 2 usb ports.","I have a Sony SXRD HDTV panel, and after connecting the panel to the Vaio via the HDMI port and selecting external monitor I am happy to say that the Blu-Ray movie played just fine at 1080 on my HDTV.The Nvidia 7600GT graphics chip is advertised as HDCP HDMI compatible and if you dig enough you find that it also has the encryption chipinstalled.So the review on this site saying that the AR290G does not play Blu-Ray movie titles is either out of date, or just inaccurate.","\u0026lt;\u003d v.bad quality hinge.-HDD spins at only 4200rpm-Battery life is just like my old 15.4\u0027\u0027 hp centrino with around 2 hours of battery, max.3 hours with wifi off and screem dim. dont see how the new santa rosa has improved the battery life in any way.-speaks produce very good sound, but even at max volume theyre very very very very quiet.-Camera doesnt want to start up sometimes and you must restart the laptop or it wont start.-keyboard isnt as comfertable as my old hp-touchpad keys are very hard and very loud-only 3 usb ports, should have 4.If you compare specs with price i would defenitly give it 5 stars, but because of all the cons im giving it four.Still this is an amazing machine, with many many pros, non of the cons are anything serious really, highly recommended.EDIT: alright so after using the machine more, here are some updates;-Battery life lasts for under 1.5 hours under high performace mode and around 2-2.25 hours until power saving mode.-If you wanna play a game, changing your settings to high performace not only does it affect the brighteness of screen ect, but it increases fps.-The keyboard isnt as bad as i fist thought also the mouse it still annoyingly loud.overall again i must say, great product.","Very Good Low Price for Turion ML-30 64 bit AMD Processor which is very Fast compare to Centrino especially when you do Graphics and this is because it has fast Processor and fast graphics chip which is ATI RADEON XPRESS 200M w/productivity ports.2.","The main differences are mine has a 80GB hard drive, 512 MB RAM, 4 USB ports and Harmon/Kardon Speakers.","En mi caso ambas port\u0026aacute;tiles terminaron da\u0026ntilde;\u0026aacute;ndose cuando la tarjeta madre dej\u0026oacute;

I like the fact that Averatec actually considered USB devices and included 3 USB 2.0 ports.","I use my computer on a lapdesk with a mouse, and the position of this port makes that impossible while I have something plugged into it.","Since I use USB ports quite often, I\u0027d have liked the 3 USB ports distributed on both sides of the machine, atleast not on the same side as the power cord.What else, Interenet connection - both ethernet and wireless work great! touchpad is also good.","Just one minor gripe - under-powered USB ports mean some external USB drives need a powered hub.","The requisite USB 2.0; FireWire 400; FireWire 800; Ethernet; optical digital audio in and out; headphone ports are available.","However, I have some definite problems with this computer:* 3 USB ports are not enough.","And for the complaint of it having only one PS2 port: Its called USB, look into it.Complaints: I\u0027ve found it heavier in practice than the specs lead me to believe.","I considered buying the Dell 8600 which is a great machine too but the Toshiba P15 offered the 2.8GHz Pentium IV processor with HT, a SD memory card slot, and an extra USB2 port which is always useful.There are only 3 issues with the P15 that if corrected would make of this a kick ass laptop: Replace XP Home with the Pro version, improve the sound system, and make it a little less bulky.Other than that, the Toshiba P15 is a great buy and will most likely satisfy the needs of demanding users like myself.","The hardware/price is excellent, the most amazing things are the 512 RAM, 15\u0027 screen, the 2.0 processor, 3 usb ports and the HD, I think in that order.","My computer had left my hands in pristine condition and the photos showed broken parts near the USB ports a puncture on the underneath side and scratches on the bottom all of which were not there when the computer left me.","Also cd burner and dvd player.7.No memory card reader or fire wire port, but i wouldn\u0027t need them anyway.8.","Better than what I have had in the past.USB ports -

They could have added another 64 MB).","The thing has a port for a microphone, but I really, really wish Toshiba had put one in.","I don\u0027t currently use it.It has plenty of USB ports, a card reader port, which handles SD (I was delighted to discover when I needed it) and some others.","The layout of the ports is very convenient and pleasing.","After a good deal of research, including spending time customizing and pricing a variety of models online, I settled on the Toshiba Satellite A135-S4487.Here are some of the pros of this laptop:+ Runs the new Windows Vista perfectly well, including the Aero interface (and I must add that I have found Vista to be a solid upgrade from XP).+ Nice big widescreen monitor.+ Toshiba support is quite good, both on their website and over the phone.+ The fingerprint reader is very cool, and especially good for multiple users.+ Switches between multiple windows and programs very easily and quickly.+ Start up time and logging on is very fast.+ The computer is very thin and feels even lighter than I was expecting.+ The 4 USB ports provides for a variety of uses and flexibility.+ The sound system is suprisingly strong for a laptop; I\u0027ve watched a couple movies on it so far and the sound was perfect.+ The massive hard disk space is quite nice.+ Runs very quietly most of the time, even quieter than my desktops I\u0027ve had at home or work.+ Was able to easily and seamlessly connect to my wireless router.The only two negatives I can think of are:- The battery is pretty weak, with charges lasting about 2 hours.","USB ports loose and poorly placed.","The 3 USB ports will be sufficient for my mouse, keyboard, and external hard drive, and the computer itself is fast and reliable.As far as Vista vs XP goes: I haven\u0027t had any compatibility issues yet, though I\u0027m certain they\u0027ll come up at some point.All told, though, the widescreen display, 2gb standard RAM, and impressive hard drive all combine to make what is, to me, a very powerful and effective system, the only downside of which is its size, which is also a plus (screen size).","Another huge improvement is that the fan exhaust is now facing back instead of to the right so my mouse hand is not overheated while using the system.As with most laptops these days there are not serial or parallel ports, in this case even with the port replicator you are out of luck if you have a parallel printer.","Excellent for light office/work use and excellent for surfing the net.However: 1) The DVD player does not function at all on moderately-worn rented DVD\u0027s, sound is distorted on light- to medium-used DVD\u0027s, and the DVD player is only satisfactory at best with brand new DVD\u0027s that have just been opened.And: 2) All USB ports have ceased to recognize my Memorex M-Flyerstorage device, as well as all other plug-in storage devices.","If you need a high performance application that hasn\u0027t been ported to the Intel version of the operating system, then stay away.","Both models are nice and compact, have tons of inputs (card reader, IR w/ remote, 3 USB ports, RGB monitor out, and Firewire).So the laptop has it\u0027s weak points, and it\u0027s strengths.","I like to sync a PalmOS device without carrying a cable (using an IR port) and I plan on getting a BlueTooth device.It performs much better than my 2GHz P4 desktop.","No infra red, no bluetooth, no Video outlet, only two USB ports, kind if frustrating, till you get used to it..But.. you can\u0027t ask for everything.","The laptop has three USB ports on the right side to accomidate external hardware.","The Adaptec USB 2.0 2-PORT 1420V Kit Prand can now connect a USB hub and from there a mouse, a keyboard and an external sound card; it\u0027s still unreliable as from time to time the mouse and keyboard start stuttering, so I\u0027m stuck with a crippled computer.","I have a few other minor gripes about this notebook: there is no PS/2 port to connect a traditional keyboard/mouse and the wireless adapter is only 802.11b (instead of the faster and backward compatible 802.11g).","It has a Google search box built into the toolbar, prevents pop-up ads (I\u0027ve never had one), has tabbed browsing (preventing a cluttered desktop), and allows for bookmarks to be added with one click.iChat allows Mac users to customize their AIM and Rendezvous chat sessions in ways that the normal applications don\u0027t allow, such as adding pictures from iPhoto to their profile.I haven\u0027t mastered iPhoto yet, but it is downloading pictures from a digital camera is as easy as plugging it into the USB port and clicking a button.Also, Macs are less likely to get a virus or be overtaken by spyware.The iCal and Address Book look good, but if you are going to sync a PDA with your Mac, you are better off using Palm Desktop software.","There also is an S-video out port, so you can show a DVD or other video on a TV set, and not just on a computer monitor.","You can enjoy high definition H264 videos, without drop frames.Ports -The MacBook Pro features 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, Gigabit Ethernet, audio in/out, and Expresscard (34 slot).Display - Apple touts the display on the new MacBook Pro as bright as the cinema displays, and there is no question: these displays are bright! Depending on your lighting condition, you\u0027ll almost certainly not turn the display to full brightness.","Using a bluetooth mouse means keeping both USB ports free for other uses if necessary.","If you don\u0027t feel like paying for either you can go open source with StarOffice, an OSX port from open office, which is a pretty decent alternative.","For those users looking for an excellent compromise between portability and power, this laptop should satisfy.Pros:- Large, crisp display that automatically brightens/dims based on ambient light- Backlit keyboard that works very well in low-light conditions- Excellent performance from a relatively low clock-speed processor- Acceptable battery life (3+ hours during normal use, 1.5 hours during heavy gaming).- Case is easy to clean and surprisingly resistant to scratches- Every port and connection imaginable: Bluetooth, 802.11b/g, FireWire 400/800, USB2.0, s-video, DVI, gigabit ethernet, etc.- Lightweight, considering the screen size.- Very stable; no \"hard\" crashes since purchase.- Phenomenal customer and technical support and unusually fast turnaround times for repairs.Cons:- The bottom of the unit can get uncomfortably hot if the processor speed is set to \"highest\".","If I was to look at another laptop it would probably be the Sony VPCEC390X but w/o that port replicator I just don\u0027t see me investing in it.","On the right side are the headphone and microphone jacks, an i.Link (IEEE 1394) port, and a DC-OUT port.","Mine is a dv4305us HP Pavilion, which has but an 80 GB hard drive, but 2 USB ports, and 512 MB of memory.","It offers two USB 2.0 ports, which, trust me, you will appreciate when using peripheral devices.","Or like in my case I wanted more hard drive so I bought a 100 gig to replace the main hard drive and by doing a little surfing online I found a parts place that sells an enclosure for a second hard drive that fits perfectly into the DVD slot, so since I do not need the DVD very often I have another 100 gig drive in most of the time, how cool is that!? Add to that that it has S video out, vga out plus a keyboard port in case you prefer a regular keyboard when at home.","The clarity of the screen has to be seen to be appreciated and the size is just right...not too small..not too thin..just right! The AC adapter is a little bulky but I use a Targa Lap Top backpack to lug it around and everything fits perfectly! I\u0027ve always had success with the Sony brand and when I spotted this laptop..I loved the appearance and the features..you have plenty of processing speed and a DVD and CD burner combo to boot! DVDs play flawlessly and CDs burn with no problem..2 2.0 USB ports on the side provide a lot of convenience and any peripherals you need to attach is as easy as pie! I\u0027m very happy with it!! I\u0027ve had this laptop for about a month now and have been pleased with its performance.I want to clear up a few misconceptions before I begin.","So far I have not found a way to purchase the plan through Sony after the fact, but I am told they will mail me an invite to do so ...I stopped buying Sony about 12 years ago because I thought their marketing people had screwed up a great company with overhyped overpriced products - this laptop exactly meets my expectations for Sony.Good luck! Note: This is a copy of the same review I posted on the Toshiba site.Intelligent Design - all ports on the side, instead of in the back, keyboard large enough to permit normal typing speeds.Excellent performance and features for the price and in comparison to competitor brands.Excellent quality and solid feel in the construction of the laptop.Excellent expandability.","This allows me to keep my \"baby\" in a zippered sleeve that I don\u0027t have to remove to plug it in or use the USB ports.","I regret buying it and it is a piece of doo doo. only 1 USB port and can not get anything else installed because the windows xp is counterfit.DONT FALL FOR IT I have just bought a new M35-S359.","\u003d)i have a desktop P4 overclocked to 3.9Ghz \u003d)its fast First, hot spots? I think that the reviewer may have had a bad computer because I have had my 1135-s155 for a while and it has no hot spots on the upper surface.The main pluses with this 2gb, 512mb, 40gb computer (other than those listed already) are that it comes with 3 (yes, three!) USB 2.0 ports when most low end computers still have 1.1 ports (the speed difference is AMAZING) and that it has 32mb of dedicated Video memory when all other companies are still using shared memory in their low end machines.","Smaller laptops with 12\" screens might be nice and compact, but an extra 2 inches makes a world of difference on your eyes.Besides all the usual USB ports and ethernet/modem port, this laptop also has built a in wireless LAN card.","On the subject of ports, I am not a fan of the power cable.","i was very disappointed in not getting the firewire port i paid for.","The audio ports are also all in the front, which doesn\u0027t make much sense for something the size of a desktop replacement laptop.","I have a wireless mouse, a cooling fan, a printer, two chargers and several jump drives that all run on USB ports.","Best features by far are the component out video ports and the 5.1 surround digital out for surround sound.","USB ports are spread all over.","Aunque he comprado a Amazon ya dos port\u0026aacute;tiles HP Pavilion y los productos HP generalmente tienen muy buena calidad, yo he tenido mala suerte con esta marca a diferencia de otras marcas que tambi\u0026eacute;n he comprado por ac\u0026aacute;.","Many expansion ports, including one for SD drive (which reads SD HC memory card by the way).","Having the flexibility of the modem and the ethernet port is great.Now, if you want to do some intensive gaming, this isn\u0027t for you.","I think it\u0027s an issue with iTunes, not the laptop.I love the ports on both sides.","Though, the AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR that adjusts screen brightness and backlight is AWESOME when it fades in to let you know it\u0027s working.- Usual suspects of big hard drive, fast processor, pretty snazzy 3d card, lots of ports, DVD \u0026 CD BURNER and loads of RAM make for a REALLY AGILE portable workhorse.- It\u0027s always great owning something where you can see the designers put oodles of love and obsession to detail.- Slot loading drive (has no breakable moving doors)- Does not generate heat like previous G3 models or earlier G4sCONS (Few and almost trivial, but worth noting for the uninitiated):- 6.8 pounds isn\u0027t the lightest thing in the world if you\u0027re lugging it around on one shoulder- Shell is slightly soft and gives way to some small body damage easily (I accidentally dropped mine on the corner from about 1.5 ft off the ground - now have a nice ding.","i found the lack of infared port troubling since i am so used to \"beam\" files at work.","Lots of goodies that no other laptop has... 4 USB 2.0 ports are great, and the DVD R/RW is really fast (4x) by today\u0027s standards.","All USB ports, which are 2.0, are on either side of the computer--two on the right and one on the left--which keeps you from having to move the computer around to access them in the back.","It\u0027s made so you can wrap the cord around it neatly when you\u0027re not using it, and then there is a little snap thing on the plug so the cord doesn\u0027t get unraveled.- Lots of useful external ports (2 usb\u0027s, firewire, ethernet, modem, PCMCIA slot, video out, S-video out, etc).","The wireless G is built in - 2 usb ports, a network port - -I can\u0027t tell you how many comments I get on a regular basis on this machine.","It would be better if they can add more ports on it.","The 3 USB ports are placed on the right side of the machine.","The USB ports work well, although some supposedly USB 2.0 compatible devices seem to think the ports are only USB 1.1.","And the fact that it does not come with a floppy is not a bonus (you can get a floppy that uses the cd or dvd port on the docking station thought).","Neither is the port \"shortage\".","I purchased one a year ago and after very light usage to complement a desktop PC and about half a dozen road trips, the AC power connector is unreliable and the left button on the trackpad/mouse is almost unusable.The power connector -- the port on the laptop itself, not the adapter accessory -- intermittently fails if I move the computer at all, and it gets ever harder to remove the power plug from the port.","An IR port.","Ports are distributed on both sides except for the power port on the back corner.","All in all, even the pics included for desktop images are great.What is not right, besides the real problem of the shutdowns? I\u0027d like another USB port, since two are too few; I\u0027d also like an standard Video Out connector, not the MiniDV thing that requires an adapter; certainly I\u0027ll prefer an internal modem instead of an external, USD 50 one.","I got roughly 4.5 hours from it, but got almost double that from the Lenovo, and about an hour more from Sony.-Small trackpad - Really small, to some not a problem - with 3 usb ports, you can find room for a mouse-No webcam - not a dealbreaker, just a good add-on Sony, and other competitors, haveBOTTOM LINE: GREAT for college students.","Eudora and Internet Explorer will be missing .exes or files to run, and I\u0027ll have to reboot, and everything will be fine.Another trauma I\u0027ve had is with the mouse port.","4 high speed USB ports are wonderful, as they fill up quickly! The wireless not only works very well, but has a conveniently located on/off switch, so you can turn it off to save energy, a feature not available on the wireless card I added to the HP.","The USB and other ports are easy to find, and the wireless - once configured properly, works well in most applications.","There is a monitor port, TV out, a SD card slot -- absolutely all kinds of little goodies.","They do not have the proper cost benefit in my opinion.4) No IR port! I don\u0027t nee this, but I\u0027m sure others might (and I may need it in the future).5) Sucker is big compared to the newer laptops out there, although it still falls in the extremely portable category.6) VERY weak warranty.","All usb ports on the left side - make sure to buy a mouse with long cable2.","It is quick, light, very easy to use..The drawback that I see is the lack of enough ports.","I like the USB ports on three sides.","I first ordered the 12\" PowerBook from Amazon and it arrived DOA- the ethernet port was defective and it would not connect to the Internet.","I can hook it up to my 1080p LCD, this thing will output 1920x1080 while watching Hulu, couldn\u0027t ask for more.(-) No optical drive, one usb port, no ethernet, no firewire, non-replaceable battery, small HDD, poor graphics.","I just finished the installation of Suse Linux 9.1 Professional from a DVD (just paid $10 bundled with the December/ 04 edition of Linux PRO magazine) on my Toshiba Satellite A45-S121 laptop,here are the main specs for the laptop:Intel Celeron 2800 Mhz , upgraded 496 MB of memory, 40 GB HDD, Teac DVD/CD-RW Combo drive, integrated Intel 82852/82855 32 MB graphics adapter, Toshiba software modem, SoundMAX integrated audio, Intel PRO/100 Ethernet controller, 1024X768@60 Hz native LCD screen resolution, ALPS Electric touchpad, 4 USB 1.1 Ports, one Parallel port and a VGA output.During the intallation the Intel integrated video was recognized as an Intel 852 GM with no problems as well as the audio as a Toshiba 82801DB AC\u002797 audio device, to my surprise the winmodem was recognized as a Toshiba 82801DB but was not configured by default, I did configured it at a later time using YaST2 with the included Smart-link modem driver that is not installed by default, the modem is working flawlessly at /dev/ttySL0 using Kinternet in KDE.","The placement of the USB ports on this thing could have been a little better placed, as well as the audio ports.","Apple, why did you change the power supply port and put it on the left.","The difference I noticed from my other laptop is that there is a lack of ports which might add to the fact that it has an incredibly simple design and that it uses only what it needs.","The good:Excellent screen, Media Center features, good performance, excellent selection of ports and storage devices.The bad:This thing is HOT and HEAVY.","Touch screen is kinda glitchy, mouse connected to usb port doesnt repsond sometimes.","The frame near the charging port is bent, and the case won\u0027t shut properly.","Port placement is sensible, though I don\u0027t understand the decision to put the parallel port behind its own little plastic door.","I hope he can have it removed soon... i think that for such a top quality computer like that, this is a bargin!

I was also impressed with the included remote control that lets you use your computer as a TV/Stereo/DVD player when using the Media Center.There are a few downsides to be aware of, however, when considering buying the AX570G.","I\u0027m always giving speeches with PowerPoints and the M35-S359 handles projector connection and porting video output with ease.","Lots of storage with 40 GB, 3 USB ports, and everything I need.","Though, I really do wish it came with more USB ports.","Al principio te hacen falta las teclas independientes de Page UP, Page Down, Inicio y Fin, pero r\u0026aacute;pidamente te adaptas al cambio.La pantalla es super clara y tiene un shortcut para hacer zoom de la im\u0026aacute;gen, la \u0026uacute;nica desventaja es que al hacerlo, se pierde la nitidez y no se puede configurar para valores de zoom definidos por el usuario.Un punto en contra es que cuando est\u0026aacute; cerrado, la distancia entre la pantalla y el teclado es tan peque\u0026ntilde;a, que continuamente se unen y quedan marcas de ello en la pantalla.El desempe\u0026ntilde;o es muy bueno y la conectividad inal\u0026aacute;mbrica es excelente; gracias a su antena, la se\u0026ntilde;al mejora sustancialmente, respecto a los Laptops que no la tienen.Me gustar\u0026iacute;a que tuvieran puertos USB adicionales (solo trae dos, uno cubierto por una tapa), debido a ello tuve que comprar un Hub USB, para multiplicar los puertos disponibles y tener f\u0026aacute;icl acceso a ellos.Utilizando el optimizador de energ\u0026iacute;a de Vaio, la duraci\u0026oacute;n de su bater\u0026iacute;a es excelente, en muchas ocasiones ya ni siquiera es necesario llevar el cargador de voltaje a todas partes.En conclusi\u0026oacute;n es muy buen equipo port\u0026aacute;til, te permite gran movilidad, autonom\u0026iacute;a y conectividad.","I highly recommend it.:) I purchased this computer in April 2007 it worked fine for about three months and then both USB ports quit.","The screen is smallish but very sharp and can be very bright (I leave it at a low level to conserve battery), the keyboard quite usable, and the included port replicator makes docking at home a breeze.","With all the usb ports, using the computer to input photos while on vacation is a snap.","The Inspiron comes with 4 at $1,500 and not even the 17\" model comes close with only 3 USB ports available.","It is super fast, with amazing features such as Windows XP (the best Windows yet), easy-to-understand ports, and an awesome screen.","The only things that broke were physical: the a/c adaptor port broken off (now I have to fiddle a bit to make sure I\u0027ve got a good connection, but it still works), and a bit of plastic broke from the latch (though the screen still closes just as before).Cons:- Rather heavy to carry around.- Poor video card performance.- Dust and dirt tend to collect underneath scree protector, so I have to remove it every now and then and clean them out.- Too many junk bundled software.- Extra Toshiba TabletPC-specific programs eat up memory.- After a year of extensive daily use, the screen rotation hinge has become slightly loose, though I envision that it\u0027ll take at least several more years before it amounts to anything.So if you\u0027re:- Looking to get more than your money\u0027s worth,- Don\u0027t plan on walking with this in one arm everywhere,- And don\u0027t plan on playing graphics-intense games (Age of Empires II works great, Age of Empires III does not),this is definitely the machine you\u0027re looking for.","All the Compaq\u0027s connections are in the right place, though missing throughout the entire 15xx line is any USB 2.0 port.","It has only 3 usb ports.","The biggest problem was that it only had two USB ports, and one of them was intermittent/broken on my unit.","On Vray (a renderer) you can see it calculates as if there are 2 processors with 2 rendering buckets.What I\u0027m sure of ..that I\u0027ll always get amazed each time I discover something new about this beautiful Machine.For people talking about short battery life I don\u0027t even use the battery, I remind them this is not a laptop this is a REAL desktop replacement.We went for a vacation, A friend of mine brought his Digital camera but he forgot to bring its USB port!

No problems at all from the HP, and since I have been so happy with this one I just upgraded to a new model with a 17\" Ultra-Brite SVGA and a DL DVD Burner!

applications don\u0027t allow, such as adding pictures from iPhoto to their profile.I haven\u0027t mastered iPhoto yet, but it is downloading pictures from a digital camera is as easy as plugging it into the USB port and clicking a button.Also, Macs are less likely to get a virus or be overtaken by spyware.The iCal and Address Book look good, but if you are going to sync a PDA with your Mac, you are better off using Palm Desktop software.","I can\u0027t get the settings right and mostly use a mouse instead.5) The video uses \"shared\" (i.e., \"stolen\") RAM, meaning your 512Mb is really 448Mb, or 384Mb if you go to 128Mb vram like others have suggested.6) The case is made of a plastic that feels flimsy and scratches easily.7) The firewire port is the irritating smaller S400, so you\u0027ll probably need a special cable.","Next, the IR port is on the front, and while I haven\u0027t needed to use it for a printer it seems an odd place to put it.","Also, this notebook does not have a serial port which is required in my line of work to communicate with devices so that is a very big mistake on Sony\u0027s part, but for most people that won\u0027t matter.Sony has improved lots of things with this machine, they moved the CDROM eject button to a place you won\u0027t accidentally hit when trying to close the CDROM tray, so they finally figured that out.All Sony needs to do is increase the clock speed of the CPU another 500 MHz above their current 1.7 GHz offering and you will have the hottest notebook on the market, as is, its a great solid replacement for a home PC used with everything but gaming.","Second, the lack of infared capability, secure digital slot or a parallel port is disappointing."],"aspect":"ports","keyword":"port"},{"responses":["There are Windows

I have loaded this machine up with great software, - I\u0027m an engineer and am using it for everything from really high end 3D graphics software, to GPS Navigator (MS Streets \u0026 Trips), to just watching movies and it is all I carry with me now.","With its 3.06 P4 and a decent ATI graphics card, it has the punch to run many of the games out today.","I\u0027ve had this laptop since 2006 and 4 years later, nothing to complain about!Not sure about the bad reviews, it works great,does not get hot and the hard drive is quiet...That a big change from a previous VAIO I had that broke down weekly.I am writing this review on the Vaio and its working great...I\u0027m sure it lost some of its original value of $1000 when new but its probably a great deal to get on Craigslist for $300!!!

Come on, guys!), average soundcard (but this is no problem with the plethora of USB and PCMCIA soundcards now available), and not the maximum graphics RAM (64MB... would have expected 128MB in an extreme machine like this).When all is said and done, though, I\u0027m stoked!

I am not one who typically writes reviews for products, but finally escaping from the Windows world, my voice just has to be heard.I\u0027ll admit I used to bash Apple since I used an old Mac back in 1995.","Lastly, if you are looking to play games on this system as well, think again; the graphics card only has 16MB and is non-upgradeable.","I chose to purchase this over the Compaq 1720US because of the addition of an extra USB port, PCMCIA slot, and better graphics card.Unfortunately, I have had the same problem with both machines, a loud whirling fan and a clicking hard drive.","Having read that it wasn\u0027t the best computer to play graphics-intensive games, I downloaded a Halo demo off apple\u0027s site.","A bit on the heavy side, but it\u0027s a recycled case from the last generation model, so it doesn\u0027t surprise me.PERFORMANCE - 4/5 - You aren\u0027t going to get outstanding graphic performance on it, but with a 2.0GHz Dual Core Processor and 1GB of RAM, you should be able to watch a movie without any trouble at full screen and run all your normal applications without lag.BATTERY - 3.5/5 - Class average.","I work with graphic programs and my after effects will not launch nor will my stand alone zacwerks animator pro.","I\u0027ve installed Linux on it and it works well now but I had the typical laptop problems: the \u0026quot;nousb\u0026quot; install option must be used to avoid keyboard freeze during installation; I had to deactivate pcmcia support which was freezing the boot (not fixed this yet b/c I don\u0027t need it); and, most frustrating, the ATI Radeon Mobility IGP 320M (U1) video card is virtually unknown by the kernel so I can\u0027t get any accelerated graphics in Linux...","Anyway, this one is certainly a powerhouse, with a bigger processor than most home systems today, coupled with a mediocre sized hard drive (especially when one considers this PC is designed to be a media center, with its very good graphics and CD \u0026amp; DVD player) and a very crisp display.The drawbacks here are important:1) The 2.8 P4 processor is not ideal for mobile use.","If you are a graphics person, there is no better computer.","I am an application developer, technical instructor and amateur graphic artist.","HP is left in the dust.-Lousy App Performance - With 2 GB of RAM, and a PCI-Express Graphics card, you\u0027d expect more out of it, but because of the slow AMD chip, it doesn\u0027t compare to the much faster Intel Core 2 Duos, and with the Santa Rosa chips (labeled under the Pro name), this computer feels outdated-Touch screen isn\u0027t incredibly intuitive - but it will work for what you\u0027re paying-No 802.11nBOTTOM LINE: As a spec mongol, it excells, as a portable laptop, it\u0027s average, as a tablet, it\u0027s mediocre, but as an entertainment device, it feels very below par from what it appears to be.","I did play a few games and not only are the graphics amazing, but there isn\u0027t any stopping or starting.Finder: I didn\u0027t think it would be very useful until I downloaded a program and had no idea where it went.","Since it was my first time ever viewing a MAC computer, was I impressed with the graphics and cool sleek design of my laptop.","I use it daily with heavy multitasking and it still runs great! For someone who can spend a day easily taking 300-700 photo\u0027s at a time for download, editing and printing...I needed something that could easily travel with me, a wide screen for close-up detailed graphics, a hefty storage space, a unit capable of handling strong photo editing tools and a keyboard easy on the fingers for building documents.","I turn all the graphics settings in Flight Simulator 2002 to full, and the video still moved smoothly.","Great notebook, it\u0027s plain and simple, yet stylish... i work with graphic design programs and haven\u0027t had any truble at all, runs any program smoothly and optimized, graphics look good and the system is fantastic! Turion 64 rules! Great notebook, very well built with nice materials, very light and with a great screen.The only thing is if you like shortcut buttons on the keyboard and close 2 it, don\u0027t buy this notebook, the keyboard is simple and clean there is no quick buttons for DVD play and sound control other then the function keyboard regular commands, so if you like just hitting 1 button to play your DVD or sliding your finger over a button to adjust sound volume, this is not for you, but, if you like clean, simple and very clean stylish looking, then buy this one.This notebook is very well built with no flaws to be noted.My overall is 5 out of 5, but that\u0027s because I rather have a clean working area with just the precise keyboard without a lot of buttons around it.","I have set Windows 7 to run for maximum performance (there are articles on the internet explaining how to set up Windows 7 for maximum performance, much of it has to do with cutting down on graphic effects and indexing).","Because this system has integrated graphics, it should NOT be expected to blaze through graphic-intensive games or applications (e.g. CAD).Because this is a 12\" notebook, they had to shrink the keyboard a bit and get creative with the placement of keys.","I am a graphic designer, and have been working on 300DPI images in Photoshop, and while I would be happier with a bigger screen, this 17\u0026quot; is more than adequate.","This graphics card is certainly good enough for the casual gamer, but serious gamers should look elsewhere.","If all you want to do is play games, you\u0027ll most likely be disappointed by the iBook\u0027s graphics card.","The 2GB RAM limitations makes this a somewhat weak performer with Vista.If you want a decent business laptop, or a viable desktop alternative, then this one is a decent choice (though there are better).If you want to play high-end games, do much video editing, or any other graphics intensive applications....then it aint.At almost 8lbs, this laptop is definitely not travel-friendly! It tends to run a bit on the warm side too, so it\u0027s more of a \u0027counter-top\u0027 than a laptop.The glossy surfaces look pretty, but attract a LOT of dust and fingerprints.","Macs were made to do graphics and animation--no PC or clone can keep up with them.I recently got my own computer, and there was no doubt about it--I got a Mac.","This is the best graphic card Apple has *ever* included in a notebook.","After this experience, I will don\u0027t think I will go back to Sony again.PROS:* Stylish looks, all aluminum palm rest (but cheap lid design)* Weights 4lb 3.4oz (I measured it with my postal scale)* Intel Duo Core @ 1.83GHz* 1GB of DDR2 RAM* Huge 120GB HDD (5400RPM)* First dual graphics laptop* GeForce Go 7400 (top of the line \"thin-n-light\" graphics processor from NVIDIA)* Nice little built-it webcam (but very low quality videos and pics)* Very bright screen (but had 3 defective pixels in a row)* Runs very cool and very quiet (even when playing 3D games)* Can play Dungeon Siege II at 1024x768 with medium setting at around 40-60fpsCONS:* Cheap looking lid surface (feels like sand paper)* No locking hinge for LCD screen* Annoying external Wi-Fi antenna (even without GPRS option)* Makes loud-whining noise when playing DVDs with labels (i.e. Memorex, Neato)* Battery jiggles and doesn\u0027t feel secured in place* Huge AC adapter weights exactly 1 pounds and is bigger than Dell\u0027s normal adapter* Battery life is a little disappointing (2h:45m on performance mode and 3h:15m on stamina mode) Let me start with a simple disclaimer, first I worked for Apple (a long time ago) for 11 years, I also worked for Microsoft for 6 years and I\u0027m pretty comfortable in both camps but I truly love Apple for it\u0027s design and combined hardware/software implementations.","After that the computer worked two more years then stopped working, but it was out of warranty and literally falling apart (the keyboard popped up in places) so I went to a neighborhood store and bought a $600 Toshiba, which has worked great for the last four years and also has way better quality sound and graphics than the Thinkpad, the tradeoff being that it does weigh more.The x61 I bought is less than a year old, and the hard drive is now nonfunctional.","It is one awesome piece of technology for the true graphics professional..RP I teach information technology.","I would recommend trying one first at a Best Buy or circuit city.Pros:- Attractive design - thinner and more eye-pleasing than M35/M35X predecessor- Exceptional sound from built-in speakers, though deeper bass is lacking- Quiet keyboard with easy-to-depress keys, though see issues below- TruBrite display produced excellent images- Touchpad is smooth and has good tactile feel- Sonoma platform with 533MHz FSB- Solid WiFi performance- Wide array of connectivity options: 3 USB 2.0 ports, FireWire, SD/MMC/xD/MS/MS Pro Media Card slot- Very quiet and cool to the touch - fan came on rarely and made a pleasant sound when running- Toshiba power management and system management software: Touch and Launch, Acoustic Silencer, graphical WiFi utility- S-Video (TV Out) for connection to projectors and TVsCons:- TruBrite display exhibits lots of glare, though this is common on nearly all glossy LCD\u0027s- Lacks DVI output and Express Card- Display exhibits too much flex and seems fragile- Poor 3D performance due to integrated graphics and shared memory- Below Average Battery life- Slower 333MHz DDR memory rather than newer 533MHz DDR2 memory, though lower latency (CL 2.5) generally compensates for slower speed- Keyboard seems slightly cramped and is shifted to the right rather than centered; dedicated Windows key is inconveniently located in upper-right area of keyboard- Relatively low-resolution 1280 x 800 display (98 PPI), though TruBrite has good color \u0026 contrast I bought this machine a little over a month ago, it replaced my Powerbook G3 1.5 Ghz.","For me, the screen-size was not so much an issue, but I feel that twice the maximum ram, the separate graphics processing unit, the Firewire 800, the ExpressCard slot (if I wanted to add a CDMA or GSM-based wireless connection card) and the LED screen was well worth the difference.Perhaps it goes without saying, but the computer itself seems well-built and well-engineered - but it\u0027s all relative and it\u0027s not hard to be a better, more integrated product than most windows-based pc\u0027s.","Don\u0027t get mad at it, just fix it! I teach high school and own a graphic art company.","Both lack the PC Card (PCMCIA) slot but can accommodate AirPort Extreme wireless network.Other than faster G4 processor, just about the only reasons to consider 12\" PowerBook are:- Larger memory capacity on the PowerBook (1.25 GB vs. 640 MB)- Larger hard disk (40 GB vs. 30 GB)- PowerBook can drive an external display (dual display) up to 2048-by-1536 via DVI port; iBook can only mirror up to 1024-by-768 via VGA port- SuperDrive (DVD burner) is optional on PowerBook; it is not available on iBook- Bluetooth is standard on PowerBook; it is optional (built-to-order) on iBook- Marginally faster GeForce FX 5200 graphics card on PowerBook (vs. Radeon 9200 on iBook)- PowerBook is slightly lighter (4.6 lbs vs. 4.9 lbs) and slightly smaller (10.9-by-8.6-by-1.18 inches vs. 11.2-by-9.1-by-1.35 inches)- You like the PowerBook\u0027s anodized aluminum allow chassis betterThere are sufficient reasons to get the iBook instead:- Costs almost 50% less- It is not dramatically slower- Longer battery life (up to 6 hours vs. 5 hours)- Polycarbonate plastic chassis is more scratch proof and offer better wireless network (AirPort Extreme) receptionHow is the iBook in itself? For a little over a grand, you get a beautifully designed notebook (similar to iPod) packed with features: combo CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive, optional 802.11g AirPort Extreme wireless network, beautiful LCD, sensible keyboard layout, snappy performance under included Mac OS X Panther 10.3 -- all in very portable form factor.","If you don\u0027t use a lot of graphics software this machine is perfect stock.","It is not a CAD or graphics workstation, nor is it intended to be.","Why it was set to 64 I\u0027ll never know as the machine seems to run a lot better now with the extra \"graphics\" memory.This machine can play some games well, although don\u0027t expect to run doom 3 on this machine.","That\u0027s really annoying.My vaio shipped with the Bluetooth gremlin toggled off, so I had to get that fixed shortly after getting it out of the box; also, hibernate is indeed dodgy: it won\u0027t work if you have the graphics set to \u0027speedy\u0027 rather than \u0027stamina\u0027.Otherwise, I\u0027m happy enough.","Also if you have altivec enabled applications, G4 is certainly the way to go.Technical Improvements: USB 1.1 \u003d\u003d\u003e USB 2.0, Airport 802.11b \u003d\u003d\u003e Airport Extreme 802.11g, updated graphics card, tray loading combo drive \u003d\u003d\u003e slot loading combo drive.Other Improvements: Panther is a more polished and refined OS compared to Jaguar.","It\u0027s the only laptop that allows you to switch between two graphic cards (integrated intel chip and Nvidia for performance) so user can optimizie the battery life or the performance based on their needs.","All in all I rate this laptop four and a half stars, great graphics too! The new 12\" iBook has everything you need in a super-portable laptop.","With the core solo processor and mediocre graphics card, I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s much I can do except disable some of the start up tasks.* Doesn\u0027t handle transparent Aero well - the computer gets choppy when handling this cosmetic feature of Vista so probably need a Core Duo Processor to run Vista to maximum ability.","The new Intel 900 graphics card does but is not as fast as the ATI 9700.","The CPU is a potent 1.8 GHz P4, capable of almost any graphics intense task.","What does that mean? Well the better graphics chipset on the HP will run 3D games and applications better.","You cannot receive any photos, smiley faces or graphics.","Its wide, 17-inch screen is optimal for gaming and watching movies, and the graphics card can handle almost everything thrown its way.","Even missing out on $250 worth of rebates because I didn\u0027t realize there was a 30-day time limit to turn them in doesn\u0027t mean this is anything less than a incredible machine.I\u0027m a graphics art Semi-Pro (retired from being a network engineer a few years ago), and I can run ALL the programs, quickly on this machine that I work with, Including Lightwave, Poser, \u0026 vue d\u0027espri.","On the other hand, it offers great privacy.BATTERYThe battery life is just average, I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s due to the dedicated graphics card.","I am a graphic designer and bought this mainly for web surfing as a second pc but am running Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Illustrator just fine.","This graphic processor will work well for most gaming, and it is great for viewing back complex H264 movies, including high definition videos.","I did not want a repeat of the graphics card failure, so I ended up putting the laptop on a wire dish-rack ($5 in the housewares section of your local discount store)and it lifted the laptop enough to give adequate ventilation.Also, the power supply is a huge brick, and the battery life is terrible, not surprising for a 17\" laptop with a desktop-type processor, but I mention this because the laptop itself is heavy, and if you plan to travel with it occasionally, the power supply is going to add weight.Also, I had wanted a 17\" laptop because I wanted a separate numeric keypad built into the laptop - the ZD7010us delivered and I really liked the keyboard - great feel and good key placement and size -- much better than the DV9910us I am using to write this review.","Basically, they split it up which causes more problems since so many programs install to the C: drive by default anyway, plus Windows XP is bloated and takes up the majority of the space anyway, then PC-Cillin tries to take up a lot of space too and you\u0027ve almost lost all of your C: drive space from these two programs alone.The third problem is the graphics card.","about 50% of the time you cannot click by just tapping the pad. and you can only click the left mouse key on the very right side of it next to the right mouse key.the cd drive sometimes locks up with or without a cd in it.s video doesnt work at all.i bet the dell that i canceled the order for would have dominated this pos pcsony has disappointed me and being a long time sony buyer this purchase really saddened me and has made me think twice about paying so much for something that may be of dreadful quality like this computer has been About a year ago, when researching the market for a computer system for my photography business, 9 out of 10 photography / graphics professionals highly recommended that I buy a Mac for my business.","That added to a $...Toshiba mail-in rebate, drew down the final cost to ...! For this tidy sum my new notebook came with the following features:Processor: Intel Pentium 4 Processor @ 2.0GHz;Screen: 15\" XGA active matrix display (1024 x 768);Memory: 256MB PC2100DDR SDRAM, max 1.0 GB;Video Card: ATI M6-P graphics controller w/16MB external DDR VRAM video memory;Removable Storage: DVD/CD-RW multifunction drive;Fixed Storage: 40GB Hard drive;NIC: 10/100 Ethernet;Modem: V.90/56K Modem;Ports: 1x Parallel printer port; 2x USB 2.0 ports; 1x VGA; 1x 1394 Firewire; 2x Type II PC Card (PCMCIA) slots; 1x S-Video out.OS: Windows XP Home Edition.First Impressions: I love this laptop! The speed of the CPU; the sharp, clear, vibrant richness of the display; the overall performance of the machine; I love this laptop! And quiet, this machine is quiet.","If you\u0027re not doing graphics every day, the 12\u0026quot; version is nice because it\u0027s so easy to use on a plane or in a Starbucks.","The windows experience index gives this machine a 3.1 out of 5... and it\u0027s all blames to the graphics.","i bought this refurb pc and i really like it.it has great sound and is pretty fastthe graphics are great for the average person.the seller was really good about the warranty and responded to my questions promptly.i would buy another one of these I bought this same machine with a larger, 80Gb drive for two hundred dollars less at my local CostCo.The Centrino is a big win over a Pentium 4 for laptop use: lots better battery life, less heat.","Keep in mind however, that not many machines offer a hybrid graphics system and a built in camera like this laptop dies.11) Overall performance - While it is not a blazingly fast machine, this laptop offers a good balance between stability and performance.","It can grow uncomfortable in heavy use - CPU and graphics card are the main contributors.- The headphones volume is quite low (what\u0027s up with that?!)- No advanced wireless config utility for built-in Broadcom 11g.And that\u0027s all! Now back to the good:- Amazing viewing angle - if you can see the surface you gonna see the image.- Drivers for 64 bit Windows XP are available now.- Speakers positioning and sound are awesome.- Sockets positioning is very good.","Now check this out, ATI MOBILITY Radeon X1400 graphics card, 128MB DDR that is Windows Vista ready.","Every part of the machine screams out major graphics.","I\u0027m a independent television producer and needed something that was lightweight, but powerful enough to handle scriptwriting software, some minor graphic design work and daily e-mail,web work while I\u0027m on the road.","It uses integrated Intel graphics chipset so it\u0027s not a gaming machine.","Processor speed is outstanding for all but the most intense calculation environments, and the nVidia GO6200 graphics are more than capable of great 3D action.","Not for gamers or extreme graphic application users.","Well this fit the bill perfectly, i passed up an HP which had some of the same specs, althought only 1mb L2 cache, and a regular ole ATI Radeon 200M graphics card.","I mainly use this laptop for communication purpose (e-mail, web browsing, MSN, ICQ, YAHOO, AOL, etc), graphics design and programming.","With future iBooks, the upgraded graphics card will unload the graphics to the GPU.","The DVD player is nifty cause it\u0027s portable and I thought the graphics and sound were great.","But for heavy graphics and video, yo may need to go to the Pro or the iMac which seems to be one heck of a good deal.","So, I purchased a new hard drive, installed it, and now my recovery cd\u0027s won\u0027t work because the graphics don\u0027t allow me to see the first window of the recovery process.","If you plan on storing lots of huge files, video editing, playing graphic intensive games, photoshop, etc... this may NOT be the right notebook for you.","The only solution to this problem would be to move the keyboard forward.As a final note, unless you\u0027re doing extensive graphics work, my opinion is that you\u0027ll get more bang for the buck by getting the black 13\" MacBook.","It comes with an integrated Intel graphics engine (Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950) that shares (steals) memory from the operating system.","The graphics arnt the best but its integrated not dedicated so you get what you pay for.","Then, in a fit of insanity, I clicked \u0026quot;buy\u0026quot; and now I am a very happy owner of the 17\u0026quot; 1.5GHz.Positives:- The screen is just massive, and you don\u0027t need to be a graphic artist or movie producer to use it; it works great for Excel, side-by-side document editing, or just keeping iChat and Sticky Notes in view while surfing the web- It\u0027s pretty fast; I\u0027m finally happy with the performance of Virtual PC 6.0 running Windows 2000 and Outlook XP; as a matter of fact I\u0027ve duplicated my Windows work laptop in VPC and no longer have to carry two machines around- Movies are incredible on the big screen, and the speakers have great stereo separation (to the point that sometimes working late at night, I think I hear someone in the room, and it turns out to be part of the song)- It\u0027s quite thin, even compared to the 12\u0026quot;, which is good on my wrists when typingNegatives:- Trying to get around the massive screen with the touchpad is a chore; get an external mouse ASAP- Sitting in bed working on e-mail can be a bit difficult, because if you end up slanting the PowerBook upwards, the cover wants to close- Even though this is one of the smallest 17\u0026quot; laptops out there, you just can\u0027t get away from the fact that it\u0027s a big monster of a machine when you spread out on a desk, airplane tray table, or other area I bought a product that is almost the same as this one (U205-S5058 instead of U205-S5057) at another store ($1200 before tax; the same specs except Vista Business), and I have been using it for about three weeks now.","The laptop has a max resolution of 1280x800 via on scren display but using the graphics card Hdmi port you can get resolutions like 2560x1900, 1920x1080 etc.This laptop has 3 usb ports, a firewire port, lightscribe is amazing print pictures directly to your disc using supported media, Hdmi out, Vga out, S video out, 5 card reader (Does not support SDHC Sd cards) finger print reader for added security, built in webcam and microphone works wonderfully using provided cyberlink software, and comes with a media remote that fits into the express slot.","This can easily fill the role of being the only computer you need to own.Sony\u0027s 16.1\u0026quot; TFT is a wonder, improving any graphic it displays.","I was so pleased with it - great graphics, the \"cool\" factor, perfect for all I needed it for (as a writer and photographer, the storage was excellent and the application were perfect).However, after having it for only six months, I noticed the screen was wobbling back and forth alarmingly.","I AM IMPRESS WITH THE ATI RADEON GRAPHICS CARD AS IT PLAYS VARIOUS 3D GAMES.","If you want to play high-end graphics games or need wireless connectivity, this computer may not be your first choice.","I now leave them open, which Apple says is fine, and speed is more than adequate.As a disclaimer, I should mention that I\u0027m a lawyer, so my usage doesn\u0027t involve heavy graphic or media work.","The 17\u0027\u0027 screen looks great, the weight isn\u0027t oppressive, and the graphical capability is just what I was looking for.","I HAVE HAD MANY LAPTOPS OVER THE YEARS, THIS ONE IS PERFECT, I PICKED THIS ONE OUT BECAUSE OF THE SPEED,WIDESCREEN, AND GRAPHICS...","I\u0027d be interested to know if the other reviewer who got 3 hours was using an additional battery.Sony \u0026quot;support\u0026quot; reps advised me to disable the graphics driver when I asked how to eliminate the \u0026quot;phone home\u0026quot; spyware imbedded in the provided configuration.","This is in contrast with many laptops that use slower graphics chip or use onboard graphics that share memory with the main RAM.","Also something that is very unique to this ultraportable is the 64 MB nVidia graphics card.","If you\u0027re a die-hard gamer, AlienWare is still better for performance and graphics.","I\u0027m not really a gamer, so I don\u0027t know how much difference that makes, but the graphics performance for DVD watching and normal screens has been quick and fine so far.There is probably more \"bloatware\" included with the computer than most people would want, such as free trials for AOL, etc.","The ATI x600 graphics adapter lets me play games like Half Life 2 and Doom 3 at decent resolutions, and the speakers sound good, but not great.","Pretty solid so far with only one crash (not exactly sure how).Final note - Don\u0027t buy this for playing games as the graphics card is way too weak and that is not what this is made for.","Otherwise, MacOSX 10.4 will run slower on your machine because the graphics will be totally loaded under your CPU.","Hmmmppphh!Third time is a charm: HP replaces it with a fully-loaded Santa Rosa 15.4\" DV6500t w/ Intel 2.4Ghz T7700 Core 2 Duo processor, 2GB RAM, HDMI, Nvidia 128MB 8400M GS Graphics Card, HD DVD, etc.","Go with the GRT series for any multimedia graphics needs.","With no bluetooth, high price, integrated graphics, and weak battery life, the only thing machine really offers is great parts and a pretty screen.","I was prepared to purchase the dell D620 business laptop because of its dedicated graphics card.","Unless you are really into high-end gaming and graphics, more important than obsessing over processor speed is to have a good, solid OS that doesn\u0027t crash on you and that is easy to use, and the iBook fits both bills.","There are no specific nVidia drivers for this graphic card yet.","i buy this laptop because i want to know other OS and performances, since i buy mu mac i love the apple, great performance, nice speed, the temperature could be a problem but i don\u0027t care that I buy this notebook to change my old HP dv6005us.I was facinated with the new design and performance of the machine.I was mainly looking for a notebook where I could work and play, and this one fills all my expectations.The graphics capacity are really cool.","Good graphic and 15.4\" (if you are into widescreen).","Although I am an art student and do use a lot of graphic applications, the screen is adequate for me.","Also, the Sony has touchpad shortcuts to close windows (tap top-left corner and drag down-right) and scroll windows vertically (slide along right of touchpad) and scroll horizontally (slide along bottom).The LCD is XGA, but contrary to what another reviewer said, VGA and SVGA will look fine and scale to full screen IF you get the latest Intel 830MG chipset graphics driver from Intel\u0027s website.","The thing doesn\u0027t come with disks, so the first thing you want to do is of course make restore disks with DVD-R (unless you like having 10 cdrom restore disks).The thing only came configured with 64mb of shared graphics memory.. had to go into the bios and it would only max out to 128mb.","It runs really well on this Macbook, even at the highest levels of detail, no doubt due to the robust CPU, large amount of memory, and powerful graphics processor.","When you get into graphics, picture editing or video editing, you do really see the lines, especially running across faces if you\u0027re working with pictures.","I was excited when I found out it will have the new Intel chip set and all the current video graphics and wireless technology.","However, be warned: if you\u0027re looking for a laptop with a huge amount of memory, a top-notch graphics card and an enormous hard drive, this is not the model for you.","Combined, these elements mean I have a machine that\u0027s far faster and more capable than all of my desktops and almost as capable as my home server (I\u0027m a systems architect, so I know servers).It\u0027s also in possession of some other features that make it a superior value: a wide-screen super bright LCD at 15.4\", a dedicated ATI graphics chip with 256Mb of memory, a dual-layer DVD burner, an SD/MMC/MS card reader, 4 2.0 USB ports, a Firewire port, and two killer radios.Killer radios? Sure.","But if you really, truly NEED every graphics feature supported, there\u0027s a 12\" PowerBook waiting for you.","I can\u0027t find a distro that supports the wee graphics chip in here, so no 3d for me.---update: i accidentally yanked the speaker cable coming out the front (a stupid place for a plug) and it pulled the thing clean off my desk.","I have MacOS X for Mail, Calendar, web surfing, documentation and any graphical work.","Why? Mainly because it\u0027s fun to use, has a decent dedicated graphics processor and keyboard (despite the key placement), and I\u0027ll have to spend hundreds more to get what this laptop already gives me.","If you do want really high-end gaming and graphics, then even the Powerbook (which isn\u0027t all *that* much better than the iBook, but is a lot more expensive) won\u0027t be good enough, and if you want a Mac, you\u0027d have to get one of the G5 desktops.","But if you add on top of this notebook\u0027s price another $200-250 you can buy full featured Toshiba Satellite with at least Core Solo processor (of course Intel Core Duo will be MUCH better option at another extra $200); excellent speakers, 1GB of RAM, fast 100GB hard drive at 5400 RPM; dual layer DVD burner, still graphics accelerator though.I own a Toshiba Satellite M35-S359 (reviewed here as well), and it is already 2 and half years of accurate use and still works without any problems (Made in Phillippines).","For such a thin notebook, it is actually heavier than the MacBook Pro by Apple, but lighter than the Dell E1505, both of which have graphics cards not integrated into the system.Price - priced really high.","The computer is nice, it\u0027s a great size, and graphic are good.","As far as the weight of the thing goes, unless you plan on standing and holding it out in front of you the weight isn\u0027t an issue, hence the term \"laptop\" At any rate, great machine, good graphics, AWESOME screen, and powerful.","Visit Dell and buy a new one, that is faster, has more RAM, a larger HD, and better graphics for the same price or even less.The 75% off they are advertising is a joke.","After my desperate search for a Sony notebook with an Nvidia graphics chip I found the NVR23.","The graphics speed is very good, but not enough for serious gamers.I will be getting a new computer soon and I would consider a Toshiba again.UPDATE: I have retired this laptop, but not before one of the lid hinges failed and the lip could not stay up with just one intact hinge.","The ATi graphics had to be set to full screen 3D to work properly in 3D, but it beats much higher end notebooks hands down.I bought an extra Logitech MX1000 wireless Laser mouse with it, for unprecedented precision in my work.I am loving it.When buying on Ebay, I always look for the amount of feedback (preferably high) and never under 98.9% positive.","The graphics and visuals are absolutely breathtaking, the light up keyboard is really nice, the overall craftsmanship of this computer is beautiful and such a step up from the regular macbook.","Love the fact that they chose ATI graphic engine.","Adobe Photoshop Elements 3 is a welcome addition, and the graphics card and specs are Windows Vista ready for all you future-proofers!I also found myself really liking some of the features I was apathetic of at first.","I am HAPPY!Great product a great laptop! The graphics on this computer is great, and the sound is awesome! The computer gets a little hot when its in use for a while, but overall its wonderful.","Reviewers all over the place have indulged in what it can and not, I just want to share some pluses and minuses with youPLUS:- For a midsize widescreen laptop relatively light and thin- a bright and glossy display- nice design- available in many configurations (1GB Ram and core2duo recommended, for Vista at least 2GB RAM and a rambo-style graphics adapter)MINUSES:- loud keyboard (that\u0027s where it pays off to get a thinkpad)- no thinkpoint/intellipoint navigation stick (damnit)- a little louder than expected from a 2007 laptop computer- warms up easily under heavy duty- display works like a pretty good mirror- the screen resolution could be higher- no bluetooth- 1 GB RAM spread over two slots 512meg each, bummerAll in all, a decent workhorse, that doesn\u0027t compare to a similarly equipped Thinkpad T series for example, but then again, it costs almost 400 bucks less than such one.","Graphics by Nvidia\u0027s Go 7600 are great for gaming, often a tough task for a notebook, but one I demand.Complaints? Wireless performance is not as good as my 2 year old Dell Inspiron 6000D, even though they both use the same built-in Intel Pro wireless card.","My only complaint is that it needed more than 1GB out of the box, but I run high graphics and CAD a ton.","I bought it 6 years ago and is still running but I could not expand it anymore and 256MB of RAM are not enough to support most of the graphic applications or multitasking.The Sony Vaio VGN-AR270GA has a lot of pros and minor cons.","The PB\u0027s graphics processor has no trouble driving my monitor at that resolution.","But the popularity of THIS notebook is completely undeserved.With my money back I got a fully loaded notebook with double the HD capacity, 4 times the RAM, a newer (presumably faster processor -Intel Core 2 Duo), dedicated graphics card, double layer DVD recorder with lightscribe, bigger and brighter screen, and most importantly: superb, friendly costumer service.","The 15\" XGA TFT screen brings graphics to life like a regular display never could, and the text is well defined, bright, and easy to read.","Occasionally the feature intended to run a DVD without turning on the hard drive (very handy) would freeze up, but other than that, wonderful! Good battery life, good graphics, nice screen, handy remote, pretty good speakers, nice keyboard, held up well when transported, and not too heavy.","Apple needs to step up here!A couple of other bummers are no DVD burner (again, other cheaper laptops usually have them), and weak graphics (yes, some girls do play games).","The video will pull anywhere from 128MB to 384 so this upgrade is even more necessary than on systems using Intel\u0027s Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950.I bought and returned a Acer Aspire 3680-2633 ( BIOS Issues) and a Tobshiba S135-4527 (32 bit processor and 2GB RAM limitation) before settling on this unit.","I guess it\u0027s all because of the 855GME integrated graphic chipset, which can handle normal day-to-day task very well but not serious gaming.","I installed Oblivion on the machine and ran it at maximum graphics settings.","Mac always has run Graphics programs a little slower than PC, but not THIS much slower.","Personally, I think the 2.0 GHz Core Duo would have been more appropriate for this computer, but the 1.83 is still no slouch.The Geforce 7900 is an excellent graphics card that will allow you to play anything out there, albeit not on the absolute highest settings.","The graphics intense power simply sits on your lap.","Sony is most notable for their S and SZ series notebooks (13.3\" Screen), or their ultraportable T and TX series, so the FS series kind of has a lack of flare in comparison.PROS:-VERY CRISP screen with 1280x800 native resolution-Great number of ports on connections, including memory card reader-Very portable-Great pricing-Pentium M-Dual Layer DVD Burner-Battery Life is better than Toshiba\u0027s (I got 2.13hours... manufacturer claims 3 hours, but I had it with max brightness and Wi-Fi, so that\u0027s pretty good... 25% more battery)-100GB Hard DriveCONS:-Outdated processor, as well as not even top of the line-Only 512MB of RAM, and not even the fastest (only 533MHz... they make 667MHz)-Graphics Media Accelerator - uncommon in Sony notebooks, but not good for anything more than causal use nonetheless - GMA\u0027s use shared memory for its virtual memory, so you could get as low was 384MB of RAM remaining if the GMA kicks in.-Useless Sony programs - Sony has terrible program interfaces, erase them once you set up everything else on your computer-XP Home - You don\u0027t have much RAM, and now you\u0027ll have lots of spyware filling it up-Heavier than it looks - I weights roughly 6lbs, but judging by how thin it is, I would\u0027ve guessed closer to 5lbs.BOTTOM LINE: A step up from some of Dell and HP\u0027s buttom of the line notebooks with 40GB hard drives and 256MB or RAM, but not enough to justify a purchase, unless you want the mobile experience with the Sony name.","We figured we could overcome that with a parallel to USB converter, but it wasn\u0027t until we bought one that we realized that Vista does not support it, so we ended up having to replace our trusty laser printer.All in all, this machine is great value for money and highly recommended, unless perhaps you need fast graphics.","You can get good 3rd party batteries for less than $40 that do not have this issue.Currently I own a Mac Pro with 4TB Raided internal Hard drive space (4 2TB hard drives), 14 GB 1066 MHz DDR3 RAM, 2 x 2.93 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon processor (8 core model), ATI Radeon HD 4870 512 MB graphics card, a 1920 x 1080 HD monitor, with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74).","Basically, it is a graphics card integrated onto your graphics card.","Dimension 5150 With Intel Pentium D 820 Processor | 1024MB PC4200 DDR2 Memory | 160GB SATA Hard drive | DVD+-R/RW CD-R/RW Burner | ATI X1300 Pro PCI Express 256MB Video Card | 8 X USB2.0 | 1 X Ethernet | USB Keyboard and Mouse | Windows XP Media Center 2005 No recovery media | Ready to install New Vista Operating system | New 450Watt Antec Power supply | 5.1 Sigmatel audio | Questions Email meThis is the specs i have on my dell and with this specs it runs smoothly on all games also ATI graphics card i have is made for VISTA Aero Feature.","Otherwise, Microsoft Works is included, as well as some graphics and other programs that I don\u0027t plan to use.The built-in wireless networking worked fine with no problems so far, and there is a port for ethernet network connection also, as well as a modem for phone line connection.All in all, I usually get a pretty accurate gut reaction to a new computer fairly fast, leading to me return them to the store on several occasions in the past.","Graphics are solid for it\u0027s price -- I\u0027ll have to upgrade in 9-12 months though.","Granted you cannot upgrade much on this machine (I got a larger HDD), so it won\u0027t replace a regular computer for gaming or serious graphic design.","Because it\u0027s using last year\u0027s dual-core and integrated graphics card, HP was able to keep the cost down, while still giving you nice upgrades like Vista Premium and a hefty 160GB hard drive.","It can burn cd\u0027s, play movies, play some fairly decent 3d games, however I doubt it\u0027s ability to play future graphic intensive games.","I surf the Web with it, do graphics and web design, play video games, and edit home photos.","I am a sales manager and part-time advertising coordinator (so you can rest assured i will advertise \u0027Apple\u0027 for the masses...i have the need to use my laptop for recording sales and inventory as well as editing some ads on graphics aps. i also use the laptop for word processing.","Mac OS does not do any of these silly non-logic load.The cons of MacBook are:-You don\u0027t have VGA output and the converter doesn\u0027t come with the notebook and you should then buy a miniDVI to VGA converter for $20.- You should only buy hardware like external drives or printers that says \"Mac Compatible\".- The white casing gets dirty \"SO\" quickly so make sure that your palms, wrists and fingers are clean.Conclusion::Go and get a Mac right now, you are mind programmed by Microsoft.I took out a star for the White casing and for the built-in shared memory graphics card.","I\u0027m going to call Toshiba tech support, but I\u0027ve read at many places that people are still getting the same \"blank\" screen problem even after updating and installing the BIOS and graphics card.","The VAIO delivers!For my type of computing, which involves writing, spreadsheets, graphics, photography and web browsing, the specs are fine with the possible exception of the hard drive size (80 gigs of storage is a little skimpy for some).","It\u0027s been said, but I would definitely NOT recommend Macs for heavy gaming (with the limited selection of titles, less-than-ideal graphics processing, etc.).","The weakest part of this machine is the graphics card.","(Passowrd logins, launching applications using different fingerprints ... yes, you can actually give Outlook the middle finger !! No pun intended.)Apart from the battery life, which is only about 3 hrs - (fine by me); everything else works to spec.The best feature, which is somewhat hidden, is a dual display feature of the graphics card in the system - which means, if you connect an external monitor, you can use use the laptop display combined with the external display as an extended desktop.Screen is clear and images are really nice, haven\u0027t used the Ilink port so far.","The best thing about vista is that it requires a lot of higher end hardware to run even the basic version, so better for us people who know vista\u0027s a joke and XP is better.I found all drivers, chipset, graphics, wireless....needed the audio and modem drivers though.","I am still using it today.Like hundreds of others, mine suffered from the poorly installed graphics card, but fortunately this didn\u0027t cause serious trouble until this year, when I had to have the card remounted.","I\u0027m really happy about his purchase.I haven\u0027t tried playing games on it yet, but with the nVidia graphics card, it should do just fine for some of the less graphics intensive games.","Aside from that, I would recommend this laptop for Linux users who have no need for graphics acceleration.","It does not even compare with the HP Xbrite, Toshiba Trubrite, and Gateway Ultrabrite.The negative aspects are the standard battery that comes with the machine that only lasts about 2 hours and the weak graphic card and integrated speakers (but, if you use earphones you get a better experience).The best reason I like this computer personally is because I got a great deal at Office Depot for less than $699 on a weekly special.","It won\u0027t do well on heavy applications like video editing or graphic designs.","If the tech and support are just going to tell me to update the BIOS or update the graphics card, then I\u0027m not even going to try it and return it.I leave for college in just 3 days, so I seriously need a laptop that will last me for about 4-5 years, and longer than that.DON\u0027T BUY this laptop, because as I have read through many websites and support forums, it seems that a lot of these laptops of Toshiba are having this problem.","My advise to anyone planning to run Vista on a notebook is to have 2 GB ram and a separate graphics card.","So I let it drop down below 90% in the morning before I plug it in.Overall if you need a muscular, powerful computer for design and editing I highly suggest purchasing one! Folks here have covered the good bits, and just to reiterate - this lappie does get boiling hot, and can burn legs, especially if you\u0027re hammering the graphics by playing, say, World of Warcraft.Secondly, the keyboard is super clattery and *loud*.","I wish it were lighter, I wish the keyboard was better, but all in all one of the best choices out there for heavy duty graphics while reasonable in price.","That said, I\u0027ve had no viewability issues in widely varied lighting conditions of my office (which is pretty bright, with overhead lighting and lots of exterior light) and my house (which is largely the opposite).- The system runs well (or so it seems) with 2 GB, but I am upgrading to 4 GB (the sticks are on their way - but not from Apple - way overpriced).- the 17\" and higher-end 15\" get 256 MB of video ram, 128 MB in the lower-end 15\" model - most folks are probably fine with 128 MB as it is the change in the graphics processor here that is truly the big news in performance.","I bought a HP Pavilion dv9000t 17\" Laptop Notebook PC by Elecsurf and I\u0027m very happy with it, its very fast, all components are ok and I have no complains, the product came on time and I got a tracking number from Elecsurf so I could check where was my product until I received it.The price was just great for the computer I bought, I live in Europe and here this would have costed just the double, so I\u0027m satisfied....If u are planing to buy at Elecsurf, do not hesitate, its a good service....According to the computer its very fast 2 BG RAM, Intel Core 2 Duo, its just fast for everything u want, games, graphic works etc....I recoment it and Elecsurf too....","Someone else made a reference to the screen being \"HDTV\" but going to Sony\u0027s web site I could not find reference to HDTV quality graphics anywhere in their product specs for this notebook.","The 512GB of ram and the integrated graphics are good enough for casual use, as well as gaming.","I\u0027ve been using this laptop for over a month already and the only thing I can say is that it is a great computer with all you can need for an intermediate demmanding user ( not advanced for the lack of a great graphic support ),but other than that is amazing for a daily personal or office work.","So also with the graphics card, which surprised me.","I did have to add Office Mac, but the Apple offers far superior graphics and publishing abilities.","Since I don\u0027t need the advanced graphics of the MacBook Pro, I got the 2.0 GHz MacBook.","I took it to a toshiba authorized repair center and they replaced both hard drives, the motherboard for graphic card problem and something else that had to do with the motherboard.","The graphics are really sharp.","So I don\u0027t really suggest this laptop to anybody, except people using this laptop to run linux or other os\u0027 without graphical interfaceRegardsReece Mak I am a computer repair tech who has a client that uses these for their road warriors.","Centrino 1.5Ghz is plenty fast for my average graphic editing, office processing programs, and directx 9.0b gaming.6.","Comes with 32MB Intel Extreme Graphics (Shared).","As a graphic designer who got put on two months bed rest during my first pregnancy in Septemeber, this little laptop has been great.","One of the cons of this machine is that, though it has 512 megs of RAM, it dedicates 128 megs to the Intel Express Graphics interface, meaning you\u0027re effectively running with 384 megs of RAM.","However, compared to the Dell E1505 and comparable other vendors I felt that the Toshiba was the clear winner.The only downside that I decided to \"settle\" for was the mediocre graphics engine that is provided with the S4517/S4467.","The SZ has a traditional tray DVD burner drive.Both the 1330 and SZ use an NVIDIA graphics card, and I think the Dell uses a newer one, but I don\u0027t know how they compare.","Also, when it has been working free of problems, it has met my needs sufficiently, which include word processing, internet surfing, and the occasional low-graphic game.","I have been saving to buy a new computer for my freelance graphic design business.","I use it for law school and it suits my needs fine - the combo DVD/CDRW is a nice addition, and the sound and graphics are of course SONY\u0027s forte.","the graphics are ok but nothing special... overall its an excellent buy.","Using an nVidia GeForce FX graphics controller with 32 MB of dedicated video memory, the screen display really makes your mouth water even if your stomach is full.","The Dual Core processor in this instance is not a low voltage, and drains the battery-Integrated Graphics-Slow processor - 1.6GHz is not thrilling, and the benchmarks, although outbeating the HP and Winbook, are not incredibly impressive-Heavy - 4.2lbs is heavy for a 12\" laptop-Terrible customer service - and Avaratec are infamous for not holding up-Lacking in media controls-Lacking in external outputs-Terrible speakers - Just ugly, weak, and tinnyBOTTOM LINE: I good starter laptop.","Yes, I was leery of the glossy screen before purchase, but images look great and glare has not been a problem in many different environments.Cost - Good price at $1299 for the white considering the $1999 MacBook Pro only adds dedicated graphics, 15\" screen, 20GB, backlit keys, and Aluminum shell.","The graphic card is 128mb. has wireless networking.","I went through three lapetops in a month in a half it being the most scarest purchase in my life they were falling apart walking out the door on my fourth try I chose the GRX550 by SONY IT will not be beat! better graphics,speed,512mbram @ much more.I would mention teck support but I have had NO need for it not 1 proublem in 3 months.","Once that is done, initial start up times increase by about 75%.PROS: Amazing screen, fast graphics, superb keyboard, lots of ports, built-in webcam, fingerprint reader, etc.CONS: One major one (at least for me) is that the audio out ports are both located on the front of the unit.","Here\u0027s the Pro\u0027s and Con\u0027s i found.F25-Sharp Clean PictureG25-A Bit Brighter, although maybe to bright?F25-Great Harman Kardon speakers, very loud and bassyG25-Same speakers although not as loud,(i must point out both of these were refurbished for one reason or another, so the speakers or sound card may have been the issue here)F25-Basic 100gig hard drive, seems like a lot until you record live TV.G25-Serial ATA 120 gig, double hard drives, 20 gigs makes a difference.F25-Nvidia Geforce 6600 Go Graphics Card-64mb-Doom 3 1024x768 low quality.G25-Nvidia Geforce 6600 Go Graphics Card-128mb-Doom 3 1024x800 High Quality-Its noticeble side by side.","i can\u0027t edit movies with imovie nearly as well as i can with my macbook pro (1.8 ghz). and i\u0027m afraid as more programs become more graphics intensive, this may be a big problem after a few years.","This is fine for card games but don\u0027t get your hopes too high.At this price range you can get a 14\" laptop with a superior graphics system, faster CPU, and faster memory (this computer is equipped with slower SDRAM not the twice as fast Double Data Rate SDRAM that is standard on 90% of the notebooks sold today).","I agree with the sentiment that it could have used a better graphics card as youtube videos can be choppy at times.","It does not handle the graphics of Vista and dumbed down to look like XP helps but is still to much for this machine.","These books come with a buch of software that will set most people up just fine: Quicken, World Book Encyclopedia, Otto Matic (game), FaxSTF, iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes, Preview (for graphics viewing, and others as well as AppleWorks which has Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Database and Drawing/Painting.","Not the best, but much better than some other integrated graphic processors.Love the wireless connectivity (Wireless Network and Bluetooth).Love the fact that it has DVDR/RW/CD-RW Combo Drive.The only thing that I added after I got this notebook is RAM.","The 2195 has better graphics, USB2.0 ports for quicker access to files on digital cameras and other devices, fire wire to load video from digital video cameras, more memory for video editing and playing games and an integrated 802.11g wireless network card.This laptop is bulky and heavy.","The screen is amazing and the dedicated NVidia graphics card makes a HUGE difference in the way the new Vista GUI operates.","I\u0027m a graphics artist and often run Photoshop CS2, Corel Painter, and a game or two at the same time alongside AIM and it handles everything flawlessly.But, of course, there\u0027s the Black Screen Of Death.","The screen is true Sony quality and the switch between the two graphic cards is useful.Considering this is the only major computer vendor with a 13.3 inch screen it\u0027s a perfect combination of small size but still comfortable for viewing.Highly recommended.","I am a professional Web and Graphic Designer and EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM I RUN IS SLOW (because the programs have to be translated by Rosetta) This just shows how careless Apple really is.","Very Good Screen quality...Speakers Sound....And where else are you going to find a small Note with a very good Graphics card...","I did play a few games and not only are the graphics amazing, but there isn\u0027t any stopping or starting.Finder: I didn\u0027t think it would be very useful until I downloaded a program and had no idea where it went.","I may load a few graphics programs to see how well they work.Like older laptops it does get quite hot which makes the DVD/CD drive a bit cranky sometimes but my last desktop PC did the same thing so I can deal with it.","Got it for 1149 at Circuit City.The Bad:1) It is still pricey.2) Does not have graphics card, for gamers.3) Does not have HDMI.4) Battery life is poor about 1.5-2 hours with power save mode on!!5) I think the resolution for 15.4 inch should be better.","What do you expect when you have a fast processor and graphics card in such a small unit.","It loads fast enough, performs most business apps well, and only stutters when I get into some more hardcore graphic and video work.","At home I hook my PB up to a Dell 17\u0026quot; flat panel, and the graphics card (which I raised to 128 megs of video) has no problem running both the native display and the Dell.","First off you get the 64 bit processor..an ATI graphics system...dvd/dvr and plenty of memory and hd space.","I do graphic and web design so I\u0027m very picky on screen clarity and performance...","I work with a lot of graphics-intensive programs, (i.e. Lightwave, Maya, Flash, Photoshop) and this laptop can handle all four with practically no slowdown at all! The screen is also quite crisp and gets nice and bright.","The video graphics is good because ATI is the best, but it uses shared memory architecture (main memory - video memory \u003d available memory), which is not very fast compared to embedded memory architecture.","The HP people were wonderful and the turn around time for repair was surprisingly quick - I got my computer back in a couple of days with a new keyboard.My CD burner stopped working recently, but the repair is covered under my extended warranty through Circuit City, where purchased.I am a graphic and web designer and run fairly large programs and have a lot of open windows in Firefox.","It is the worst graphics solution in use today.","Since she has been using it every day and has never had a problem.While my mother a Real Estate Broker may not test the capabilities of a computer, I as a graphics artist, do very intense graphics at sometimes better that 30 frames per second at very high resolution, and can test the abilties of a computer very in very short order, am completly satisfied with the performance of this machine.I am personally using a Compaq Presario 1800T that I had built in June of 2001 and will never use a Compaq or Hewlet Packard product again.","I play LOTR Online with high spec graphics and it has no issues.Just the job, Slight issue with the web cam when switching between MSN \u0026 Yahoo msg though this is fixed by disabling and enabling in device manager.","It also plays Titan Quest, though I have better results turning down the graphics settings on that one (it\u0027s a real graphics hog).The finish is very durable, though the black gloss finish does show fingerprints easily.","Take it from a Graphic expert this is the sharpest and clearest screen my eyes had ever seen.","The graphics are shared which stinks... but the vaio has been a great bang for the buck.","But next laptop, I\u0027ll look at the graphics a little harder (I didn\u0027t have a lot of time to research before buying this one).","Still, system performance is more than adequate.I would highly recommend this computer for someone wanting an above average mainstream laptop for general computing and perhaps some moderate graphics (Photoshop) work.","If I were doing commercial graphic designing or commercial video work I would probably get a MacBook Pro, but for personal work this is much more than a normal person needs.","With shared graphics accelerator you must give up on graphics intensive games.Because of the cheap price I view it as a good budget laptop.","But if your needs are modest, this is a good buy! If you\u0027re looking for a laptop with a good balance between price, performance and work, there\u0027s the one! It can provide you the best typing experience, 100% confortable, easily hot, and it even runs the most complicated games with HQ graphics!Plus, it\u0027s a good student PC... if you\u0027re looking for a portable desktop/multimedia center, look no further.","The graphics processing chips had numerous design flaws, all leading to overheating.","What does that mean? Well the better graphics chipset on the HP will run 3D games and applications better.","That\u0027s because of the graphic card and 2GB memory.","However, the SZ has an option to turn off the NVIDIA card and use the integrated graphics card to save battery life which I find useful.","You can buy 4GB for under $100 nowadays and have a laptop that will be ready and able to run most of the software you want for a good long time.The only people I wouldn\u0027t recommend to buy this are people who want to play graphics-intensive games, since the graphics processor in the macbooks is pretty weak.","That desktop has \u0026quot;integrated Intel graphics\u0026quot; and the iBook has 32mb of dedicated graphics memory, so maybe that has something to do with it, but the desktop also has 512mb memory, while the iBook has 256mb.","It looks great and although, it is heavy, I like being able to play my graphics intense games when I\u0027m traveling.","Granted, if you want to play some of the more graphics intense games, this is NOT the machine you want.","Pop in a dvd and you\u0027ll see what i\u0027m talking about.2) I heart the graphics card.","And this is typical of OSX\u0027s approach to seamless operation.The Powerbook excels at graphics and music work, and that is where my interests lie.","Then again, the MacBook Pro comes with a graphics card that can drive an external (additional) 21\" monitor without breaking a sweat, and that *is* enough for most coding needs.","The nvidia 7600 graphics card is an important option for anyone who intends to game or anything that requires intense video.Used the bundled software to burn mpeg movies to DVD.","I offered to take another make or model of graphics card and even offered to go buy the card myself if the agreed to pay for it.They refused to help in any way.","The design of the computer is very nice with silver color, also the weight of the computer is light compared with other same sizes computers.Display is very blight, it looks good.Vista works smoothly, but this computer is not good for computer gamers because on the Vista, graphic rating is just 3.3.","So far I have to used it to play UT2004(all graphics on max), Splinter Cell \u0026 Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow, Counter-Strike Condition Zero, and a few others.","The regular battery is around 3 hours (average brightness and no sound on on speed mode - lower end graphics card).","I\u0027ve had no boot up problems, no black screen or blue screen of death, and no software issues.But that\u0027s about it.The fact that Toshiba would even consider creating a laptop which runs the increasingly idiotic Vista on only 1 gig of ram can be considered a sin to the modern consumer, but making the ram shared with the integrated graphics card means Toshiba has made the prince of darkness look like a pansy.","I personally believe that the regular Macbook suffers a speed impediment from the low quality integrated graphics.","Light scribe, though, is pretty useless since you need to buy special discs that I can never find on sale.Graphics: Try not to get a model with Integrated graphics like the Intel 950 or nVidia\u0027s better but still integrated 6150.","However, some digging on my part showed an undocumented advanced graphic media setting some six menus down in desktop - properties that needed to be changed.)Also, regarding initial set up: I found I could not separate the Bluetooth, wireless lan and wwan settings and needed to talk with customer service again, but they were used to this call and quickly walked me through the network setup (incidentally, the wait time to talk to a techie was about 1 minute).As with most laptops, the keyboard is flat, not tiered.","Except for very large graphics files, though, going into the hundreds of Megabytes, I never found overheating a problem.","Very cool, in fact, in the \"stamina\" mode - you can feel a heat a little bit in the \"speed\" mode (with the dedicated graphics card turned on.)","I\u0027ve seen benchmarks which put the graphics performance around average for a laptop this size.","The graphics for this computer are pretty good, and pretty much everything else is well over satisfactory.The only cons about this computer is the 512mb memory, but that can easily be upgraded, and all you need is another 512mb memory upgrade and you\u0027re set.","I had a Compaq Presario 2500 with an 80GB Harddrive, 15\" screen, 64MB graphics card, 768 MB RAM, with wireless internet and a 1400 by 1050 resolution.","First chief feature of HP z7010us is the extreme graphics it produces.","Below are the ratings given by the system, and can be good for comparing other laptops.Processor: 4.7Memory (RAM): 4.5Graphics: 3.2Gaming Graphics: 3.1Primary Hard Disk: 4.9System Base Score: 3.1What the base score means, according to Microsoft\u0027s description, is that you can confidently purchase software that has a base score of 3.1 or lower.","The ATI graphics xpress 200 doesn\u0027t impress me, however....don\u0027t expect much performance for games unless you run at low resolution.","The graphics card does quite well too.","The prize in this system is the graphical display.","Light Scribe is an added touchCons - Not a gaming notebook..graphics card is low-end, gets very hot if used on lap, included battery is only about 1-1.5 hrs long.","Pretty solid so far with only one crash (not exactly sure how).Final note - Don\u0027t buy this for playing games as the graphics card is way too weak and that is not what this is made for.","After my Gateway toasted itself, I needed to pick up a good, cheap computer to replace it, and the Aspire fit the bill: for what I paid for it at Walmart ($740), I was able to get a lot of features that you would only see on higher end machines- which I\u0027ll sum up with the obligatory pros and cons:Pros:-Dual AMD Turion64 processors-100 GB HDD-Gig of RAM-Looks nice-Integrated camera niftyness-Touchpad based navigation clicker is useful (little silver square between the mouse buttons)-It\u0027s really light- about a pound or two lighter than other notebooksCons:-New product line- might not have the support structure of Dell or HP-The 100 GB HDD is actually two 50 GB HDDs- while that\u0027s a neat feature- the computer cannot recognize them as the same drive: not sure if I like that or not yet*Update: After about 3 days I ran into an issue with the graphics card (software issue, not hardware), and had to get help from customer support: it turns out as I predicted that they have a pretty poor support structure.","It is in repairs and being repaired since 2.2.2006 with the same problem for 6 times now.This laptop has 4th hard drive, 3rd motherboard, 2nd graphic card, 2nd cooling fans and who knows what else.","And again, if you\u0027re not doing extensive graphics work, I\u0027d say it\u0027s not worth it.","It really is an amazing breakthrough, from Intel.Video CardThe new MacBook Pro 2 GHZ model features an ATI Radeon X1600 graphics processor using PCI Express 128 MB of GDDR3 video memory.","Now keep in mind this laptop was purchased in May/June 07 so if your reading this and its 2010, things may have changed..With a 2.0 Ghz CPU, 2MB RAM, and dedicated Nvidia Go 7700 graphics card, It ran the usual Word and Excel programs w/out any problems.","SUPERB GRAPHICS.","The powerful processor, graphics, memory and the arsenal of connectivity options make this a perfect contender for that spot where you monitor now sits.","The graphics card core temperature rose to 71C (That\u0027s 159.8F for us westerners).","It has pretty fast processor and 512 Mb Ram, DVD RW+- and 60GB HDD - this is a good thin, but the Graphic Card is not good - if you want to use this item for games - this is not your choice, but for wark and watching movies- perfect laptop.","I am also a graphic designer and photographer and I push my machines to their limits on a daily basis.","Bright, good resolution, but plagued by a bad graphics card, restricting it from its true potential.RAM - there isn\u0027t much room to expand, but with 1GB of RAM already in the device, you many not really need to go more than that.","The shared graphics card makes the graphics absolutely terrible for any type of gaming or movies, and the compromised ram results in slow and often non-responsive performance.","But in certain and common conditions the battery ends very fast.-Graphic card is not as good as expected in terms of overall performance.-Heavy power adapter.","If true, that\u0027s about twice the battery autonomy of my Pro- not having a \"real\" graphics card is no impediment to any \"normal\" use, only for gaming (and perhaps video editing)- screen and keyboard are much more comfortable than I thought.","I run doom 3 at full 1680 32 bit graphics without a hickup! I did think about buying a $800 entry level laptop...but you know how it goes, you end up buying things twice if you dont purchase what really want.","It\u0027s just not as full-featured as the absolute-latest graphics chips.","Better get an extra battery or auto/air adapter for this one if you plan on using any CPU/Graphic intensive applications on a long flight.One more thing worth mentioning is it seems HP has gone to shipping there product without installing the \"Pre-installed\" software.","So far I\u0027ve done the BIOS update, graphics driver update, and ran with the battery removed....still get the blank screen Across the line, Sony had redesigned or refreshed most of their laptop product line, and the online photos do not do them justice at all.","It also has Lightscribe for putting monochrome graphics and text on Lightscribe CDs and DVDs.","Disconcerting though.Otherwise, it was very fast - especially with the NVidia graphics.","I upgraded mine to 1gb of RAM and am a graphic designer and have had no problem in using photoshop CS3 or any of mine design programs.","Well here it is, and you can get it at Amazon.com (when its available!) ...The Toshiba Satellite 1415-S105 can\u0027t beat the cheaper HP x125 on any grade except for sceen size (and there is a catch to that).Let\u0027s compare these two models:HP Pavilion xt125CPU: 1.6 GHz Celeron (Built on a P4 core with a smaller cache)RAM: 256 MB DDR RAM - Good20GB hard drive - Good enoughGraphics Card: ATI MOBILITY RADEON 7500C w/32MB - very goodDisplay Diagonal Size: 14 inches - FineLCD Resolution: 1024x768 - Good for a 14\"Toshiba Satellite 1415-S105 (cost 10% more)CPU: 1.6 GHz CeleronRAM: 256 MB DDR RAM - Good20GB hard drive - Good enoughGraphics Card: nVIDIA GeForce4 420 Go w/16MB - pretty goodDisplay Diagonal Size: 15 inches - GoodLCD Resolution: 1024x768 - Not great for a 15\"Summary: The xt125 has a better graphic chipset, and a smaller screen that uses the same number of pixels as the Toshiba.","The graphics look great.","I\u0027m impressed with the display, though I am not a serious graphical user.3.","From the sound quality to the portability to the fact that I can run today\u0027s games (which require better graphics cards to more than the listed 512mb of ram), this laptop has never ceases to amaze me.","A week ago, the NVidia graphics card was shot.","Back then, it represented state-of-the-art with 1\u0026quot; thick titanium-finished chassis and 15.2\u0026quot; widescreen LCD, filled with many desktop-like features: 667 MHz G4 processor (up from 500 MHz of 1st generation PowerBook G4), gigabit ethernet (up from fast ethernet), built-in AirPort (was optional), and DVD/CD-RW combo drive (was DVD-ROM or CD-RW only).Two more generations of PowerBooks later (3rd added 1280 by 854 LCD, DVI output, faster graphics, and 800 MHz G4; 4th added 1 GHz G4, faster graphics, and SuperDrive), we get more substantial upgrade.","Got it for gaming and graphics work.","I wanted a laptop that is portable and have good graphic card.","Windows 7 removes this limitation.My computer is 3 years old, but now runs very snappy - far better than it ever performed as a new machine.The fact that it is a duo processor helps as well.I also added a Toshiba usb bluetooth adapter for about $35 that gave the machine bluetooth capability.The biggest downer to this laptop is the graphics chip which is embedded into the motherboard.","It far exceeds my Dell notebook capabilities in sounds and graphics.","I\u0027ll start with my complaints and then my compliments :)Complaints:I\u0027m in the Graphic Design field and use programs like Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Dreamweaver and Flash (Creative Suites 2 Web Bundle) often two or three at the same time.","The 2.0GHz processor is lightning fast and it has better graphics than I have seen on many PCs.","Good for playing games - good graphics, games run smoothly.","It is an Integrated Graphics Media Accelerator-running machine that stores files, gets on the internet, and plays movies.","TWO THUMBS AND BIG TOES UP,I WILL DEFINITLY SHOP HERE AGAIN, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. i would recomend this laptop because it has a good system plus it came with extra stuff so get it I would recommend this labtop to anyone..It is worth every sent.The hp imprint finish is really nice.Hp really takes pride in manufacturing their items..From first glance you are attracted to the beauty and layout of this labtop..its really a special edition as printed....It is really fast.programs install so fast that sometimes you don\u0027t even see the progress bars.The graphics is supberb.I run a lot of graphic and cpu intensive programs like audio editing,video editing,dj mixing.And amazingly I can run all those programs simultaneously without any drop in system performance.and still have an anti virus scanning.the new Intel centrino duo really lives up to its name.you can really do more....the mobile remote fits in the pcmia slot so you can never lose it.The ports at the side are very useful.like the hdmi.Webcam works great and the finger print reader works nice to......I don\u0027t know why one reviewer said that it doesn\u0027t have blue tooth but this one has it as advertised and it works great..And its just the perfect viewing size to at least watch movies and have a couple of windows opened up at the same time.I give this series a full 10 because I haven\u0027t found a single problem with it.","The whole idea behind getting an integrated card is that you don\u0027t need much graphics card horsepower so you opt for a cheaper one that is also more energy efficient.Still, it is a large screen just made for your viewing pleasure at a decent price, so its not a bad PC just one that has certain obvious limitation (like lugging it around daily for example).P.S.","The graphics card tends to heat up the fastest on this notebook.","Apple can no longer be known for graphics.","The glossy screen is actually much clearer for text, although graphics professionals will surely prefer a matte screen because of color fidelity issues.- wireless reception is fabulous.","As with other comments in here, the graphics performance is just marginal, but works fine for DVDs and iTunes videos, etc.","the battery holds a decent 3 hour charge and juices up nice and fast (an hour and a half) when i\u0027m low. and while it\u0027s not the best gaming computer in the world, i was able to run plenty of 3d games online and off with relative ease and respectable graphics performance.my only possible complaint is the awkwardness of the jumpy touch pad, but that is easily solved by purchasing a $10 usb mouse at radio shack or where ever.in short, if you\u0027re looking for a machine that\u0027s great for work and will be able to have fun on your lunch break, you can\u0027t possibly go wrong with this toy. and at under $1k, it\u0027s well worth the price.","Firstly, I would like to explain that my T60p has slightly different specifications from the one listed above; I have a Core 2 Duo T7200 processor, 3GB or RAM, a 320GB HDD, and the ATI FireGL V5250 graphics card.","There was a known issue with the graphics adapter.","Consider adding at least another 256.- internal fan is sometime annoying when you do heavy graphics/calculation.","MAC OSX \u0026 of course iLife.The Bad:Battery doesn\u0027t seem to last as long as iBook.It does get hot!- not a deal breaker though.The Ugly:Integrated graphics.","I just installed 1gig of ram, and never have lag issues with the MBOX. so i think for all musicians this works great.ALso, i do a lot of graphic design on the computer, so if thats what you do, this is the best machine for you.","nVidia graphics boad provides hardware support for playing HD video.","Game performance was fine, and I found the graphics to be quite acceptable.","battery stinks- maybe 1 1/2 max-w/ power saver, screen down to no brightness and performance at lowest possible.tons of grippes on bottom-2 headset jacks-comes w/ a lot of junk-hd only 140gb even though they say 160gb-graphic card not so good-easy on/off switch for wirelessall around it is a wonderful laptop-would strongly suggest it Good luck if you want to do a clean install of windows after you buy this computer.","Plus the price was great with the rebate from HP and Amazon! This is a great computer, the only flaw I can find is in the graphics card.","I do games, audio, web and graphics development, work - until last month, I was all PC all the time.With that said, this is one of the most solid, stylish, functional and FUN - yes FUN - devices I\u0027ve ever owned! The performance, usability, feature set and reliability is peerless and I would be hard pressed to find such touches as a lighted keyboard, magnetic AC power, built in camera, hard drive drop protection, firewire 800, Express card, auto dimming LCD, Ati x1600 graphics, Wifi, Bluetooth, DVI, slot load superdrive, included media remote and the plethora of software features as standard in a portable, affordable PC package.","I thought I would not like the integrated GMA950 Intel graphics, but the reduced heat and increased battery life of the integrated graphics are of much greater value to me than being able to squeeze more FPS out of a 3D game which I hardly play on a laptop.","Sadly, most of my pro audio and graphics software investment is Windows-based, not Mac-based.i found this page you\u0027re reading right now by searching Google for \"Sony VAIO VGN SZ shuts off spontaneously\" ... and i found the other reviews here stating the same things as i\u0027ve stated (granted i am more wordy). but look around and you will see...","The maximum capacity is only 2GB, however, with a machine using an Integrated Graphics Card, there is not really a need to go for 4GB of RAM anyways.","This computer has performed really well and it\u0027s graphics and game play abilites are quite excellent for a budget laptop.","So I scrutinsed the screen, the ports, the graphics and the drives.","heavy little thing but thats why its a tough book (a) Best keyboard ever made for laptops, (b) Decent speed, runs Office 2007 O.k., (c) Acceptable graphics (ATI 7500) or good graphics (ATI 9000 / 9600 / FireGL, the latter 2 can play Far Cry 1.0), (d) Thinklight is very useful on overseas plane flights, (e) fits perfectly on all airplane tray tables, (f) Outstanding battery life with CD-battery + 9-cell (5-6 hrs if you dim the screen), (g) It actually sleeps and wakes up properly unlike 50% of all laptops, and (h) You can just grab it and run to a conference room, yanking it out of the minidock, and it will sleep properly, unlike newer (T60, T400) machines where you have to hit a key first !!DONT buy anything with less than 1.8 Ghz processor as the 1.7 Ghz and lower have a smaller cache(2MB vs 3MB) and are about 33% slower.I have used about 4x of these machines at work over the past 6 years.","The dissatisfied reviewers here are either victims of notebook infant mortality or use their computers very hard (i.e., they abuse them).The details: 1) excellent clarity in the display--only one dead pixel in the center of the screen which is totally unnoticeable unless you are viewing graphics or videos that are predominantly in the darker region of the spectrum; a non-issue, as far as I\u0027m concerned.","Heck, you don\u0027t even have to be a professional photographer or a graphics or web designer.","After a few weeks though, you don\u0027t even notice the difference: my work is graphics intensive, and this screen is bright and brilliant, and it adjusts to multiple angles to make even the most tight seating arrangement a reasonable work space.","Graphics are good, by no means the best, and everything works smoothly out of the box.","Which also brings me to the point of the battery...the design just makes it feels cheap, it literally jiggles when you move the laptop around, I heard elsewhere on the forums that it can disconnect and the laptop would lose power, I tried to see if it would but it didn\u0027t happen to me, but I wouldn\u0027t doubt it from what I saw.In terms of battery life, there are two modes, one is \"stamina\" or long life mode which uses the onboard Intel 950 graphics chip and the other is \"power\" or performance mode and it uses the Geforce Go 7400, this is the top of the line NVIDIA chipset for the \"thin-n-light\" class of laptops.","We have very specfic as well as demanding requirements such as high graphics resolution, lots of RAM, lots of CPU power as well as good connectivity and CD-R/W, etc.","It is super fast, AMAZING sound, OK graphics, and a long battery life! the screen is slightly sharp, but still great! The scroll pad is easy and convienent.","The Geforce 440 Go graphics card is probably the weakest part of this system, but it still has 64 MB of dedicated memory.","It seems like this thing is even a good gaming machine because it comes with a very good graphics card.All that being said, I am not a gamer, but I do enjoy playing games occasionally, so it is important to me that I can do that well.","One thing hinders this computer for me, the Intel 950 graphics is a joke.","i have not played games on it yet but the Intel internal graphics look great on pictures and DVD and Web expeirence.","It is probably less by less than 5 min or so.In conclusion, if you are looking for a new PC based lappy with great battery life, solid OS, good graphic, well built, medium size weight (it is pretty light to carrying around), just grab one but don\u0027t forget about the HDD and battery.","I love this computer! I\u0027ve had my K33 over a year, and am using it primarily for Audio/Video/Graphics Processing as an independent consultant.","The bottom line is you will not find a laptop this small with dedicated graphics and this much power at any price! Speaking of price, the only con I found (and this is amazon\u0027s fault, not sony\u0027s) is that a few days after I received it the price came down by a hundred dollars! This works in your favor as it is an even better deal.","I\u0027ve had it on for 10 hours now, wearing thin cotton pajama pants, and can barely feel any heat from it: a huge improvement over the red burned splotches from the other laptops I\u0027ve owned! So far Ive played World of Warcraft on it, which runs in max resolution with all graphics settings on max, smooth as can be: not even my desktop does that.","It cannot play any games more than once and has many little bugs, like all Hp\u0027s.I have never had a realiable Hp plus any notebook that has a shared graphic card or \"vidieo ram\" will not play vidieo games.","I have ordered an optional 12-cell battery so I can get longer use without plugging into the AC power.Also, this notebook comes with nVidia GeForce Go 7400 graphics card, with 128MB graphics memory.","Here\u0027s my spin:PROs* 15in display (also nice quality images)* Battery life (I get 3 hrs when set to \u0026quot;long life\u0026quot;)* USB 2.0* Overall quality build (keyboard \u0026amp; display especially nice)* Some nice features: 40GB/CDRW+DVD/56K+NICCONs (these are really just quibbles)* Only 2 USB ports (my last Satellite had 3)* USB port orientation (vertical is tough fit for some USB drives)* Integrated graphics (Not really an issue for non-gamers)* CDRW speed (does it really get the full 8X?)* 256MB RAM (you\u0027ll definitely want to upgrade within 6mths)As I said, the CONs are really just quibbles.","If you really want one of these, then get the equivilent of this laptop, A GAMEBOY! If you want good preformance, especialy graphics and video, get a MAC.","You cannot play today\u0027s most graphic-intensive games with this machine (example: Call of Duty 4 will not work).Nevertheless, by maxing out the RAM at 4 GB, upgrading the operating system to Windows 7, setting Windows 7 for maximum performance, adding 16 GB of flash drive memory by ReadyBoost, and regularly running Ad-Aware and maintenance on the computer, it runs as fast as modern machines.","I use it for communications, graphic design, web design, presentations, light music and video creation, and the occasional game.","It has a very good graphics card.","The system is a beast when it comes to gaming, I\u0027m not a big gamer, but the few that I\u0027ve played ran extreamly smooth, Left 4 Dead 2, Call of Duty World at War, and Modern Warfare, all ran without a single hitch, and online play really screamed.The system is professional looking so you won\u0027t be embarrassed to pull it out in the boardroom, It\u0027s classy looking and the graphics on the lid really rock.","It is extremely powerful when it comes to graphics and games, and for the price, a CD-RW/DVD drive is reasomable.","Love the fact that they chose ATI graphic engine.","The video/graphics preformance on gateway laptops suck.","For BIG gamers, you might consider a MacBook Pro for the graphics card, but my games (like Age of Empires III) run just fine on my regular MacBook.","The fan turned on during the conversion, but shut down shortly after that, as different graphic engine was used.Of course, the screen is beautiful.","Don\u0027t work with the Intel Graphic chips.","The DVD burner is as usual very good, burns nicely although most Notebook model DVD burners burn a few minutes slower than desktops, but hey whats 11 minutes compared to 8 really? So yes this baby has it all, stylish looks, powerful Intel Centrino Pentium M Processor, running at 1.86ghz, good graphics card(better than any that come \"standard\" in systems these days), DVD burner, Digital Video Recording, watching and recording live tv, etc etc.","The AV650 is heavier than Sony\u0027s AR190, so that\u0027s also kinda disappointing.PERFORMANCE:As I mentioned before the processor is a 2.0GHz processor... but besides that being slightly disappointing, so is the graphics card.","But so far, the 512M performs well for most tasks; heavy-duty graphics and software development environments may need more memory.","Graphics are beatiful and writing is a pleasure as the fonts are incredibly crisp but in many cases (especially browsing on the web) fonts are TINY and hard to see so make sure you check out a similar screen before buying to make sure you\u0027re comfortable with this.","The following are the pros and cons...Pros...+ Super simple set-up -- took me less than half an hour to open the box, configure the system, and establish an internet connection through my home-based, WEP enabled 802.11g wireless network+ Stunning graphics display (1200 X 800 resolution is awesome!)+ Lightening fast handling of MS office applications (a 60 day trial version of MS office -- Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint is pre-loaded)+ Fit and finish are BMW-like (i.e., high speed, low drag)+ Extremely nice touch for Sony to have preloaded a decent anti-spyware application (SpySubtract)and Norton Security (3 month trial version)+ A couple reviewers have maligned the 128 MB Intel graphics card, but using an idependent test site (pcpitstop.com), the graphics card received extremely high marks+ Over-all configuration/performance are similar to machines costing several hundred more (somewhat unusal for a premium brand like Sony)+ Keyboard action is sweeeet -- so is the big and fat 100GB hard drive (can\u0027t ever imagine having the content to fill it up!)+ Comsumer\u0027s Union (publisher of Consumer Reports) continually gives Sony high marks for build qualityCons...+ Sony\u0027s knucklheaded bean-counters decided to save money by equipping the machine with a 7 foot power cord -- I have never (and I mean never ever) seen a machine in this price tier come with such a short powercord (my Dell that I use for work came with a 12 foot powercord); I now have to make a 2nd trip to the store to rectify this albiet small, but nevertheless disappointing shortcoming+ I am surprised that the built in speakers are just this side of acceptable (that\u0027s okay as I live for searching Amazon for fun peripherals!)+ I am also somewhat surprised that there are so few hot (a.k.a. quick connect) buttons for multi-media and internet apps (just two!) -- many other machines come with half a dozen or more+ Would like to see more free software preloaded (this seems to be an issue with most of Sony\u0027s machines: laptop and desktop; high end and low end)+ Touch pad takes a little getting used to (not quite sensitive enough at the default setting)Hope this helped with your search for a new machine! Never again will I buy anything Toshiba.","The ATI Radeon Mobility display chip is not supported by X out of the box (you can use the frame buffer driver instead, and its OK), but an X update exists from SuSE which apparantly supports the graphics chip with accelleration.","In truth, if I had wanted all the features that make Vista such a graphically beautiful interface, I would have purchased a Mac.","All of the buttons/SD card slot/graphics worked perfectly after the restore.","If you check the Vista homepage, you will find that to get the full visual and performance effect of Aero Technology (what Vista is good for) you need a video (graphics) card with at least 128mg discrete memory and a procesor with 800MHz FSB.","Trained as a legal secretary a zillion years ago, I know how to type, so it\u0027s not a matter of missing the keys or pressing too lightly.As I am typing this review, every third word or so has to be retyped because a key is not registering!

full networking; a built in CD/DVD drive; built in fingerprint reader; bright, high resolution screen; a seven hour battery life even when networked; more than adequate memory and hard drive suitable for all but heavy graphics; the ability to play DVD\u0027s without starting up Windows and a total weight of less than 3 pounds.My first concerns were: Can someone with \"older\" vision and reflexes actually read the screen and use the keyboard?I found that, although bright and clear, the screen is definitely small.","Even if you don\u0027t play games, subcompact notebooks that use the old Intel integrated graphics won\u0027t be able to use the future version of windows as it will require direct x support.","No more of those annoying black borders that surround a horizontal screen.2.8GHz Pentium 4 is one of the fastest processors for any laptop available, and a 64MB Radeon graphics card is good for a laptop, and 512 DDR RAM is very good for a laptop as well.THE POINT IS: all these wonderful features for such a GREAT PRICE and especially for a Sony VAIO, which generally is more expensive and Sony\u0027s reputation for laptops is very good.-The full size keyboard is nice, not as crampedDRAWBACKS:-8 pounds is considered heavy for a laptop, although you would have to spend significantly more for a weaker, lighter Centrino laptop-Battery consumption is slightly high due to it\u0027s incredible processing power.However, I feel that battery consumption is a non-issue because most of the time when you\u0027re working, there are places to plug your laptop into a wall outlet.However, I do not recommend this laptop if you\u0027re constantly moving around without being close to wall outlets or are too weak to carry this laptop.","Well, I\u0027m here to tell you how to get around it to prevent it and make this work perfect with XP.Intel\u0027s website will give you the laptop chipset and graphics driver for the mobile intel 945 express chipset family.Now go to Hp\u0027s site, support and drivers, type in presario c306us, then windows XP and download the drivers for the audio, modem and the broadcom wireless, and the hp quick launch buttons and you\u0027re set.Cons on this laptop are the lack of connections such as pcmcia slots, but who really needs anything more than this? I think a built in card reader would have been nice, but isn\u0027t really necessary.A gig of ram, and windows XP make this laptop worth the price I payed for it, and hp/compaq knows this so they make it difficult to use it at it\u0027s full potential, marketing is all it is.","Wayyy better than Windows.- Extremely solid construction and feel.- Elegant and compact power cord setup with the famous magnetic detach system to prevent annoying and damaging cord yanks.- Comes with lots of software and apps that really work.- Roomy storage and good overall performance.- Does not run too hot, even when performance settings are turned up.- Supports Bluetooth 2.0 and a lot of the newer, sexier Bluetooth profiles including A2DP and stereo headsets.- Big, bright, clear screen.- The built-in camera takes decent video and it works well with Skype.- With Parallels, runs Windows Vista Ultimate flawlessly so far, even with old apps, simultaneously with the Mac OS.- The feel of the latest Mac desktop seems brawny yet nimble with lots of seductive graphics, morphing windows, flip screens and more.","Granted if you are a serious gamer/graphics user the Intel graphics offering may present a problem.Being a complete skeptic about whether the dual-processor what worth the additional $ I decided to put it through a few unorthodox tests.","And when you put videos in full screen they glitch.Had to tweak the Os in order for it to run a little better.Most newer applications will not run because the Ibook is non intelSo if you are looking for a Apple computer to work on graphics or anything of that nature isuggest you get a newer one.","And although I don\u0027t get the top flight graphics card as an ATI/GEFORCE, I am still pretty happy at how the FS570 handles my Sims2 game.What was most important for me was getting the 100 GB HD and 1GB of RAM.","Microsoft Windows tends to limit me getting anything done.. particularly in Graphics Design degree which of course is only macs.As far as games, of course most of the games out there are made for windows.","I bought this laptop about a year ago and it is great!

the ibook and a ibm and i love aol and mac just doesnt compare to a ibm with that.If you prefer mac then this is a good choice.There are better mac laptops out there but this is great.Its a little heavy but the handle is very supportive and trusty.the speed is preety fast.as you probalby know mac doesnt allow downloading any window programs unless you buy the make your mac compatible to windows program thing.The imovie is great.It does not come with games such as solitare or anything that would come with an ibm comp. and its a little unconvienent looking for software in mac all the time.There is alot of room to rest your palms which i like.But jsut like all laptops u must be very careful with the charger ive broken mine previously without even being rough and they are exspensive to replace.I like the computer but it realy does depend on your use for it IF YOU SERIOUSLY WANT MY OPINION ON BUYING THE FS-660,..I WOULD SAY , BUY IT,...(HOWEVER ..DO NOT GO FOR THE FS-640 )I first bought the FS-640,.. but had problems with it,..like the speakers were bad, the processor speed was slow the battery lasted only for about 60-70 mins,.and worst of all I had problems even playing CueClub,....I immediately exchanged it for FS-660,...and i\u0027m glad i did it,..this is a great laptop ,..specially for students,..it is stylish( nobody can beat SONY,..). it has the nVIDIA graphics card to support your ram,(it may not aid an avid game lover,...but does a great job,)also...it has a better processor..however i feel SONY should have done a better job with the battery,...it barely gives an hour \u0026 half ,... and a lil more quality on the speakers would give a perfect 5.0..on the whole i can give it a 4.5 on a scle of 5.0 If you\u0027ve seen one you know the are works of art.","If your considering a Mac purchase, and want a portable, I believe the PB 15\" is the best of all worlds as far as size, features and shear power (the 12\" dosen\u0027t give you the screen real

Nobody puts superb speakers in notebooks likes Toshiba does, because they put (in most models) Harman Kardon, which is a renowned brand in audio equipment.11) I can\u0027t comment on durability because it was just purchased.","So don\u0027t expect to listen to MP3/CD at high quality from the builtin audio output.2.","A year and a half of use and it is stable, the display is fine, the battery life is nothing special.If you need to record audio, you\u0027ll be surprised: the only input is MONO!This computer spends more time in hourglass mode or stuck with the hard drive spinning than I\u0027d like.","After 7 desktops in one year, I\u0027ve finally found the replacement in just 7 days of owning this laptop! I researched them all and for the money this is the way to go and I\u0027m in no way disatified!(minus the fact that you can only add an external floppy drive!)I was gonna get the zt1190 or zt1180 but read that alot of people were having problems with there screens?! Oh yeah, the polk audio speakers don\u0027t do it justice but if you get the zt1170 instead of the 80 or 90, you can throw the diffrence towards some ALtec Lansing 200 watt speakers like I did also, so when you get home you can quick plug to a home stereo-effect!I havent had any compadability problems like I thought i would from going from a desk top to laptop.If your not rich, you can afford this one and still have a better laptop than many others! After a 2 week whirlwind trip to Europe and back I have to say that I am over-the-moon with the Sony VAIO VGN-S260.Firstly, this is the lightest laptop I have ever owned (by far) and it has been tremendous.","Although it is not that big of a deal, but its functionality is very handy when watching DVD and listening audio.7.","The audio chokes, the video jumps...4.","Everything about this system is awesome, except....It doesn\u0027t have a stereo line in (I\u0027m gonna get a USB audio interface) and it feels very fragile (like if it were dropped it might explode into a hundred pieces).","The hard drive also has plenty of space at 100GB and seems to be fast enough running at 5,400 rpm with SATA interface.The Sony software for audio and video and editing seems pretty good and I haven\u0027t had any problems so far.","You can enjoy high definition H264 videos, without drop frames.Ports -The MacBook Pro features 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, Gigabit Ethernet, audio in/out, and Expresscard (34 slot).Display - Apple touts the display on the new MacBook Pro as bright as the cinema displays, and there is no question: these displays are bright! Depending on your lighting condition, you\u0027ll almost certainly not turn the display to full brightness.","The integrated speakers suck very bad! I\u0027ve tried any winamp/mediaplayer/soundcard audio settings and do not improve anything.","Once that is done, initial start up times increase by about 75%.PROS: Amazing screen, fast graphics, superb keyboard, lots of ports, built-in webcam, fingerprint reader, etc.CONS: One major one (at least for me) is that the audio out ports are both located on the front of the unit.","As you may or may not know, motherboards are expensive, and in my case, the motherboard went TWICE in each computer.My usage was light -- simply for business applications -- no gaming, no mega streaming audio or video -- just applications.","Sadly, standard warranties do not cover the operating system (they consider that software), and getting these problems fixed has been a headache and an unwelcome bill.Speaking of audio, the speakers are so low that you can\u0027t use this computer to play music or a DVD, unless you\u0027re right up at the screen or have the headphones in.","It is also lacking a true line-in audio input, there is only mic-in and headphone-out, this is a consideration if you want to record stereo line-level audio.Also, the hi-def screen will necessitate using the XP extra-large font setting with a 120+DPI screen res setting to prevent squinting.","Some recurring issues in forums are: overheating issues, dead pixel (one) on the LCD (which some tech guy at a store told me is common on LCD screens, anyhow), smaller keyboard size (true enough, but it\u0027s not bad at all), sound system not being outstanding (come on, people, get a desktop for such extensive audio work!), and the Windows XP Home Edition that\u0027s pre-loaded (yes, really, DO upgrade to the Pro Edition, as it\u0027s less \"buggy\").BUT, what notebook is perfect? What other notebook has this much power, speed, battery power-saving capabilities (Centrino, baby), DVD-RW/CD-RW, Widescreen LCD screen display (you have to SEE to believe..it\u0027s SO beautifully bright that you can\u0027t help but be mesmerized and think \"purty\"!), 80GB storage capacity, firewire port, 4 USB ports, built-in wireless WiFi connectivity (get the Linksys Wireless router WRT54G for faster, more reliable speed), SD memory storage, and at 6 lbs., what else could you want? Think about it: what notebook doesn\u0027t have problems? They all do or will at some point.","It has all the ports that I need such as two USBs, serial, printer, and your audio and video ports.","That function works well, and is very convenient.The computer is quite well-equipped with ports; there are 3 USB ports, a VGA-out port, firewire, audio 3.5mm ports for headphones and microphone, as well as an SPDIF audio port.","I BOUGHT IT 30 DAYS AGO, AND IT HAS SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE AUDIO.","Video games play a lot better on this laptop then I thought, despite the obvious problems I have been having with the sound.I have only had this laptop a day and I am already thinking about returning it or exchanging it for something else, I hope I can fix the audio on this thing.","There are full versions included word processing (only a Demo download of Word Mac 4) but the audio and video programs like Garage band and imovie are GREAT.","Audio is excellent, however, the low volumn level is disappointing.","Great audio (for a laptop).","The Video/Audio play back, it pauses likes the mouse, not even a smooth play, everything plays smoothly on a $300 machine, but not on this $3k baby.","If they do, I would not buy this unit.As a sidebar, I will also state that nearly all of the Sony products I have ever purchased - including 2 televisions, 1 audio amplifier, and 2 computers - have proved to have defects.","my windows laptop has not been turned on..make sure to get parallels or vmware for any apps that are not mac ready.. with that you can safely do what you needmoving from outlook to mac cal and mail is a bit of a chore if you have lots of folders, attachments etc.. lost a lot of my attachments by doing an imap upload to a local mail server then using the mac to get them all.. not all lost but too many to go and count to give a %amazing

from my HP 6400..white palm rest gets dirty and needs to be cleaned with mr. clean magic eraser once about 3 monthsoverall..","Considering that this notebook is targetted for the audio/video presentation users, quite often utilizing memory intensive programs like \"Photoshop\" as well the latest software for digital scanning, the performance would most likely be better with more memory allocation capability.* The \"home\" key is just to the right of the backspace and is an ergonomic disaster when quite often backspacing will brush and activate the \"home\" key that will put your cursor a mile away from when you wanted to.* The jog wheel is again a brain-dead feature that\u0027s useless.* Considering the obnoxious hard-disk, one could have at least configured an external drive to be used....but again out of luck because there is no additional USB port.* Adding additional drive is a big problem and again SOOONNNY flunked in the design department because additional storage is not designed in the expandability department.PROS :Other than the big screen, the new laptop offers very little functional features.Suggestion : Bypass the GRX series and wait at least for improvements.","And don\u0027t even think about using this laptop on your lap.My 3250 has an actual little audio volume wheel.","In 1999 I bought a VAIO desktop Digital Studio Desktop (455Mhz) , and it never let me down, actually we are still using it now at home.The laptop, when at home isconnected to a Sony DCR-TRV310 Digital 8 camera via ilink, a Sony DRX-510UL USB and Ilink DVD+-RW/+-R, and a western digital WD1200B007 external Hard disk.With 3 USB ports, a Ilink , 2 PCMCIA and Memory stick , compostive video out, audio out this laptop is great for multimedia.Three sore points :-There is no built in Microphone, just a mic input-Finding a connector to hook up the Component video directly to TV is something I am still pursuiing.- As a real road warrior, I carry this laptop in a roller due to its weight.Battery is acceptable, but not extraordinary.I could not find a docking station, which would have come handy.I use a laptop stand/Lap platform to prevent heating problems, as the main fan outlet is underneath.The Keyboard is a real natural.","Add to that the Pentium 3.2 HT processor with 533 front side bus, large 80 Meg hard drive, very fast wireless B/G adaptor even though my router is an old Linksys 11 Meg B standard, and the dual layer 8X +/- DVD writer, the rest of the specs are large 15.4 brilliant screen, full size keyboard, 56K Modem, 1 Fire wire 1394, 3 USB 2, Ethernet adaptor, 1 A/V out, Microphone in, Audio out, and a lot of multimedia and authoring software.Set up is a breeze, the laptop is unpacked, hooked, and run in 5 minutes, you better have things to do right away.","There is a on off indicator for the mouse and wireless.I don\u0027t like the way connection ports are on the sides and on the front is the audio.","I mostly use it for audio/video playback, audio/video conversion and overall web surfing and basic MS Office.The battery life is average at best (with WiFi turned off and screen dimmed).","But even that doesn\u0027t have the ability to serve as an audio player when the PC itself is powered down, and I use that feature on this PC.I\u0027ve installed Fedora Linux, Win98SE, BeOS, and Ubunto Linux on this system as well (swapping drives is easy).","Excellent audio and video and makes up a good cinemascope screen and good theater like environment for watching DVDs.Connects to wi-fi network with ease.Portability also good but some may not like the 15\u0026quot; WXGA screen which makes the laptop look lil big but then if you go for a lesser screen you clearly lose the clarity.Keyboard is springy and not hard like other laptops but I would buy an additional set of mouse and keyboard.I found the DVD drive to be too gentle and sometimes fear if that would come out if I use a bit of force.Overall it is my dream machine and hope it would be the same for you too.Happy Toshiba-ing The laptop is okay, works great but the battery won\u0027t stay charged...guess I will have to purchase a battery because I am tired of having to plug it in to use it.","TWO THUMBS AND BIG TOES UP,I WILL DEFINITLY SHOP HERE AGAIN, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. i would recomend this laptop because it has a good system plus it came with extra stuff so get it I would recommend this labtop to anyone..It is worth every sent.The hp imprint finish is really nice.Hp really takes pride in manufacturing their items..From first glance you are attracted to the beauty and layout of this labtop..its really a special edition as printed....It is really fast.programs install so fast that sometimes you don\u0027t even see the progress bars.The graphics is supberb.I run a lot of graphic and cpu intensive programs like audio editing,video editing,dj mixing.And amazingly I can run all those programs simultaneously without any drop in system performance.and still have an anti virus scanning.the new Intel centrino duo really lives up to its name.you can really do more....the mobile remote fits in the pcmia slot so you can never lose it.The ports at the side are very useful.like the hdmi.Webcam works great and the finger print reader works nice to......I don\u0027t know why one reviewer said that it doesn\u0027t have blue tooth but this one has it as advertised and it works great..And its just the perfect viewing size to at least watch movies and have a couple of windows opened up at the same time.I give this series a full 10 because I haven\u0027t found a single problem with it.","The logo says ALTEC LANSING, which is a name \"audio heads\" will be familiar with, so I suppose they\u0027re on to something here.","Output options ----- were talking Firewire, Firewire 800, USB, DVI, best of all, SVIDEO and AUDIO output ---- making it VERY easy to connect this baby to a nice TV!!! its pretty freaking coolI don\u0027t know what else to say ---- buy it! IT ROCKSfor those of you afraid to switch, let me give you reasons why ---- Microsoft Office on OS X (which works better here than it does on XP)- Final Cut Pro (better than any Windoze editing system)- All Adobe apps available here- All Macromedia apps available heredid I forget anything? I don\u0027t know what the person were talking about? It seems he gotproblems with Amazon.","Pros:1- High performance (Video/Divx(coding/decoding)/Game)2- High quality screen (Bright, good contrast, not supporting many resolutions though, maybe because it has a wide aspect ratio)3- Good specification (Good size RAM, SATA hard drive)4- Good features (memory card reader)5- My favorite (Express media Player, no need to boot up the OS to watch a DVD, I love it)6- Reliable (to my experience in these past five weeks)7- Good Audio (Not the best speakers and power output, but it does produce clear sounds not usually expected from laptops in this price range)8- Good wireless reception(picks up neighboring networks well!, but I have my own)9- Good size and design, and not heavy in comparison to other laptops that I have had.Personally, I very much recommend this laptop (specialy to students and HomeOffice owners).","It\u0027s supposed to sleep, but sometimes it stays on for no good reason.-There aren\u0027t enough dock controls (you can\u0027t turn off the annoying bouncing alert).-Sometimes the screen goes blue for a few seconds after waking up.-I have the screen brightness set to \"Never Dim\", but it still does.-The track pad doesn\u0027t keep scrolling when you get to its edge.-You can\u0027t disable the annoying 1980\u0027s start up sound.-It takes way too long to rename files.-The logic of the highlighting text needs improvement.-There is a lot of noise in the audio jack.-The key-repeat isn\u0027t fast enough.-It won\u0027t remember the finder\u0027s view settings for a second.-Programs spontaneously stall and/or quit.That\u0027s all.","And we have the latest revisions.Sorry for the layman\u0027s approach to this but a laptop with a 100 GB hard drive, 1.86 GHz, 504 RAM should be able to handle audio, video, business and Internet software.Remember, the same software works on the older two laptops.","The loud fan is almost always on and interferes with audio and recording.","I hope that the audio driver is revised to circumvent this problem.","I do games, audio, web and graphics development, work - until last month, I was all PC all the time.With that said, this is one of the most solid, stylish, functional and FUN - yes FUN - devices I\u0027ve ever owned! The performance, usability, feature set and reliability is peerless and I would be hard pressed to find such touches as a lighted keyboard, magnetic AC power, built in camera, hard drive drop protection, firewire 800, Express card, auto dimming LCD, Ati x1600 graphics, Wifi, Bluetooth, DVI, slot load superdrive, included media remote and the plethora of software features as standard in a portable, affordable PC package.","Sadly, most of my pro audio and graphics software investment is Windows-based, not Mac-based.i found this page you\u0027re reading right now by searching Google for \"Sony VAIO VGN SZ shuts off spontaneously\" ... and i found the other reviews here stating the same things as i\u0027ve stated (granted i am more wordy). but look around and you will see...","I would recommend that you take Averatec\u0027s published advice and \"avoid operating\" this notebook if you plan Internet, audio, or video usage on battery power and don\u0027t waste your time and money buying it.","You would definitely appear more professional with this machine next to smaller laptops you see in meetings on conference tables.The bundled software speaks to the superior audio and video output of this machine.","Perhaps they get theirs made especially for them and cut corners? That said, I have heard alot of complaints about the customer service practices of Sony even though I havent had to deal with them (yet).Pros: The machine looks great, the screen is bright and crisp, the perfomance is fairly good, ample USB slots, the integrated GMA900 vid card works well for most games, keyboard is nice and stiff, its amazingly thin, DLDVD+-RW/CD+-RW is handy, it runs silent and never gets more than a bit warm.Cons: Headphone/Audio out jack is in an inconvienient spot (front), the white colour gets dirty, no video out without the purchase of a docking station, slightly on the heavy side.","The screen is marvelous and the audio is grade A for a laptop.","I love this computer! I\u0027ve had my K33 over a year, and am using it primarily for Audio/Video/Graphics Processing as an independent consultant.","Voice recorded audio is poor also.","Not recommended for the people on move, then you may need additional power backup and weight you need to carry back(8 lbs).The only disadvantage is it does not have infrared sensor and s-video pin and quite bulky for 8 lbs.The audio quality is improved in this model with good dolby sound though near the screen.","Music is loud and clean for a laptop....no need to buy external speakers unless you want really LOUD audio....Cons: Kinda costly....set me back ~$3,000.00US but i think its worth the price if you\u0027re into movies, music, large HDD space and high-tech stuff.","The audio card supports this.","To make my point, I simply refer to Averatec\u0027s manual for this unit (page 39), in which they caution users \"AVOID OPERATING\" this computer on \"battery power\" for the Internet, faxing, and audio or video (CD/DVDs).","The audio doesn\u0027t work.","The review would have been more favorable earlier, but you got to consider in terms of today\u0027s technology, would people want to get this laptop, so that is what I based my review on.Pros:------decent speakers for notebook speakers-decent sound quality on headphones-fast enough processor-great feel on keyboard \u0026 touchpad-external monitor support-PC card expansion slot-screen is bright and sharp-decent budget laptop I guess...-fairly rugged and durable, reliableCons:------glossy screen glare annoying in bright places-uneven backlighting becomes annoyingly obvious when watching DVD movies in a dark place-wireless card in the laptop is intermittent, not much of a problem when just surfing the web, but a major issue when using streaming video/audio content, or playing online games, which both require a constant connection-short battery life even on minimal use-slow \u0026 limited RAM really drasticaly affects performance, lots of page file usage (over 500MB at times!!!) makes things slow when loading or switching applications.","As a college student, this computer has proved to be fast and reliable, though the main two reasons why I didn\u0027t give it a 5/5 is because:a)It is pretty bulky by today\u0027s standardsb)No S-Video port (a must on most of today\u0027s computers, but it does have a VGA port so you can still manage to connect it to other audio/video devices).The speakers that the computer include are not that great, but I already had Z-680\u0027s so it wasn\u0027t a big deal.The graphics on this computer are pretty good, and it has a decent amount of memory.","Very annoying, but I sent them the information I found online)1 HDMI output (for connecting to a compatible HDTV or home theater receiver for uncompressed digital audio and video.","The touchpad requires very minimal pressure to operate, and the left and right control buttons are large and well placed.Three USB ports, one Firewire port, a parallel port, external monitor port, PCMCIA slots (2), and standard audio ports are provided.","The 128MB ATI Radeon x600SE video was a nice feature as was the secondary audio processor.","I found that setting it up to 64 meant not being able to connect to the foxL, but backing down to 50ish bits or so works well, and the audio quality, while not incredible, is at least tolerable to surprisingly good.SSD/TRIM UPDATE: For whatever reasons, neither my OS X 10.6.7 nor BootCamp W7 installs recognized my Samsung SSD as supporting TRIM.","In addition, digital audio and video outputs allow the unit to connect to any television or home audio equipment for watching DVD movies and more.","The speakers sound great but the audio output should be louder, unless I\u0027m going deaf already.This model comes with a Blu-Ray recordable drive which is supposed to output at full 1080p resolution through the HDMI output connector.","Lasted around 2.5 hours.(normal life, I would presume)Screen is too bright at times (see review on crkt cty), and one needs to constantly move it to adjust to right view.Also, the DVD was a little sketchy when one moves the mouse over(as if there were scratches), and also, audio would be distorted if one attempted to open some other application.(For eg, I ran the WinXP tour)Other than these small grouses, it looks awesome, there\u0027s absolutely no noise from the fan at all.","S-Video output, DVI output (plus a VGA adapter), Firewire 800, Firewire 400, Gigabit Ethernet, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out, and a PC card

ExpressCard/34) and Type I/II 32-bit card bus (also supports 16-bit// VGA (15-pin), TV-out (S-video) (I said everything!), notebook expansion port 2, microphone-in, headphone out with S/PDIF Digital Audio), and some of the best speakers I\u0027ve ever heard on ANY laptop...","As far as the port limitations go the only thing i use is audio jack, usb, and ethernet at school but there\u0027s wifi too.","I try to open a file after associating the player with audio files, and Windows tells me that it can\u0027t find the file.","Well, I\u0027m here to tell you how to get around it to prevent it

drivers, type in presario c306us, then windows XP and download the drivers for the audio, modem and the broadcom wireless, and the hp quick launch buttons and you\u0027re set.Cons on this laptop are the lack of connections such as pcmcia slots, but who really needs anything more than this? I think a built in card reader would have been nice, but isn\u0027t really necessary.A gig of ram, and windows XP make this laptop worth the price I payed for it, and hp/compaq knows this so they make it difficult to use it at it\u0027s full potential, marketing is all it is.","I don\u0027t know if the audio driver needs to be updated, or I just got a malfunctioning laptop, but the sound on this thing is horendous!

Boot up time and overall usage of the system is a little slower than the 2199US, but with 240MB left(16MB for Video) it does a good job even when playing games or opening several applications at once, probably will give credit to the Intel chipset here again.- Battery seems to last around 3Hrs with normal usage like surfing and word processing.- Video card has good performance, with only 16MB got an 1700 score with 3DMark01 @ 1024x768x32 almost the same as the ATI IGP on the 2199US.- Most people claim that the support and service from Toshiba is far superior than HP/CPQ, can\u0027t account for that since I only had these systems for a few hours.- Audio, volume control is on the right hand side and adjustable by hand, unlike the 2199US that is dificult to reach and works only under Windows.","The digital audio produced no sound.","The video and audio quality are poor.","I upgraded to 1Gig of RAM and bought an M-Audio FastTrack USB audio interface - the end result being an extremely powerfull and totally portable recording workstation.","The requisite USB 2.0; FireWire 400; FireWire 800; Ethernet; optical digital audio in and out; headphone ports are available.","All the important stuff works with XP under Boot Camp: wireless, Bluetooth, audio, and above all the display drivers (my need for 3D acceleration is why I went with Boot Camp over Parallels).","May work better if your TV has the RCA audio/vido connectors.","don\u0027t know about the latest version, but my 800mhz doesn\u0027t have audio in, flexy keyboard!5. software is limited and development tend to be behind wintel machine .Good point1.","If your considering a Mac purchase, and want a portable, I believe the PB 15\" is the best of all worlds as far as size, features and shear power (the 12\" dosen\u0027t give you the screen real estate required for audio or graphic editing, the 17\" is just too big to lug around comfortably and safely).","They are around the same price, but the Qosmio is an audio-visual dream.Good luck!

but you have to also consider the components within).The only reason I did not buy the HP is because the cooling sucks... my friend has one (not the 17\" model though) and he needs an external fan to cool it.","Since Apple makes its own hardware and software, I believe macs have an advantage over PCs, which are a smorgasbord of components from a lot of diverse companies.","Every component I have connected via USB or Firewire (including a PSP, a Lyra MP3 player, 2 Motorola Cell phones, and a couple of DV camcorders) have been recognized and worked flawlessly without having to install drivers.","The only components I have replaced so far was the keyboard (went through two from overuse) and one of the touch pad buttons (wore out from overuse again), and that\u0027s it.","It\u0027s the first name brand (and non-pieced together from individual components) system I\u0027ve ever owned.","I like the idea of using UNIX commands on my Mac, although I can do everything with the user-friendly Mac interface.Yes, Powerbook is more expensive compared with Dell and other PCs, but you get what you pay for: top-quality components, futuristic functionality, eye-catching design, and the enormous joy of owning a rock-solid elegant machine (like BMW!).","Then with this buy I get a beauty laptop, with great components (RAM, HD, etc) and great brand at a very good price.","The best part is that the most expensive component of your laptop, the LCD screen is covered by it.6.","I work in IT so having some components missing found in the Pro edition like remote desktop and other features had me itching to upgrade.I still wasn\u0027t committed yet and didn\u0027t want to upgrade to XP Pro unless this machine passed one final hurdle.","Overall, it is a well thought out design and Sony definitely didn\u0027t skimp on the components.","I have found no problems or incompatibilities with its components or with the accessories I plug in (No hang ups, no blue screens of death, just plug and play).","If weight and size aren\u0027t an issue I would definitely recommend this notebook.Update!: Finally got around to using the component video out ports and hooked it up to my HDTV, you can set the output all the way up to 720p if your tv supports it, incredible picture! If you want to take advantage of the surround sound capability of this laptop you will need a toslink adapter for the headphone jack, you can find them for a few dollars.","Drivers are generally unavailable for the components unless Compaq posts them.","With the included components, it\u0027s QUITE an awesome DVR unit.","The spec components can be upgraded easily and the CardBUS/PCMCIA will accept new WIFI cards, etc.","There are not many 15\" notebooks in this price range, but HP has achieved this by using second-class components.","A hot CPU can run for a year till it fries some MB component and then a computer that worked long enough to be out of warranty now starts giving you problems, or even no longer works at all.4) It comes with Vista.","Because IBM engineers have optimized the machine\u0027s various components to work together, this machine seems faster than 366 Mhz.","Apple\u0027s engineers ingeniously relied on some of the internal components themselves as part of the skeleton for the case.","The rank shows how well a component works with Vista and is called the Windows Experience Index.","The hard disk and the screen are the two components that break sooner or later 99% of the time and Toshiba wins the durability test against Sony hands down.","I bought a HP Pavilion dv9000t 17\" Laptop Notebook PC by Elecsurf and I\u0027m very happy with it, its very fast, all components are ok and I have no complains, the product came on time and I got a tracking number from Elecsurf so I could check where was my product until I received it.The price was just great for the computer I bought, I live in Europe and here this would have costed just the double, so I\u0027m satisfied....If u are planing to buy at Elecsurf, do not hesitate, its a good service....According to the computer its very fast 2 BG RAM, Intel Core 2 Duo, its just fast for everything u want, games, graphic works etc....I recoment it and Elecsurf too....","Support by Dell was great but who wants to continuously ship components in and out.On the whole I\u0027m very satisfied with this laptop.","Sony strives to create a refined package with close integration of the various hardware components.","What made the old Toshibas as good as they were, was that they either made their own components, or subcontracted locally in Japan, and assembled all their machines at home.","My problem is that there is no place in U.S. to buy additional components, ie. battery, for Gericom laptops.","After 4 months of use, here are some things I consider notable:+ Clean exterior lines, glossy-black exterior with sharp-cut edges contrasting with simple, polished silver interior+ No annoying, high pitched capacitor whine+ hibernation/sleep/wake is flawless+ sweat from your palm does not permanently stain the enamel finished palmrest+ fan noise really low after April 2006 BIOS release update+ included Microsoft OneNote 2003 is quite useful with great UI+ LCD: LG Philips LPG6500 15\" XGA TFT+ HDD: Toshiba MK4026GAX 40GB 5400RPM with 16MB cache+ Takes power efficient DDR2 4200 Memory (compared to DDR) (Hynix DDR2-533 1.8V 256MB preinstalled)+ Optical Drive: TSST TS-L462C- Noisy optical drive (unless you set the quiet drive utility manually, which always defaults into \"noisy mode\")- Celeron Processor does not throttle down even when doing nothing- Left palm area warm- BATTERY LIFE (~1hr, 4 cell 29 Watt hour basic pack)- no card reader or IEEE 1394All in all, Toshiba really packs some high quality components into this nicely designed/built \"budget\" notebook.","Expect to give this computer TLC (tender loving care) and to have some computer hardware experience, as you will need to replace, maintain, and upgrade components, but this task should not be that challenging with this model.","You\u0027d figure it would do this and be a gentle reminder to improve the cooling around the laptop, rather than risk overheating components.* The touchpad works brilliantly BUT the left touchpad button wears out prematurely.","Vista ranks system components performance from 1 to 5.9 with 5.9 being the highest.","The battery power is the poorest, yet most important component of this notebook.","Dell couldn\u0027t compete in terms of price/components, and HP is a disaster when it comes to customer service.","I have never had to replace or repair any internal component.","Here are the big comparison points I considered.(Note, I am not an expert on computers or components -

I actually dual-boot between it and Ubuntu Linux, which both scream compared to Vista.","While on the topic of Windows -- You will need to pay for a program called Parallel Desktop in order to run Windows under Mac - otherwise you need to reboot to get back into OS X or reboot to bet back into Boot Camp.","Also there is a program called Parallels 3.0 which will let you run windows inside the Mac OS.","it dosplays vaio logo, then tries to load windows, it can not, it says that there is a problem with that soft loading.My undestanding is that this may happened because of the problem with a hard drive.","The only way to boot from a USB device is to plug the device in, go into the Setup menu, and change the boot order so that the USB device is above the internal hard drive.Other than that, though, the DVD multi-drive is awesome, cpu frequency scaling works great for reducing power consumption and heat dissipation, and like I said, it\u0027s still going strong after 3 years of heavy use (I ran mprime (aka Prime95 in Windows) on it 24/7 for nearly a year with nary a problem).Oh, and the touchpad is very sensitive, but in Linux, one can configure the touchpad click to be disabled for any period of time after typing (I set it for one second).","Hace meses que estaba esperando que a la Serie P25 la proveyeran de todas las caracter\u0026iacute;sticas para hacerla realmente una m\u0026aacute;quina equilibrada en s\u0026iacute;

I love the mag power cord, the compact size of it (although I was worried about the small screen size -- which has proved only difficult when reading and typing in word, so I just use the zoom feature and set it at 150%), and the great programs including dashboard and ilife suite.","it is so fast, usually opening a program on my windows machine would take forever, but with my mac, i can open programs in a matter of seconds.","So...I got a MAC! :) I was previously a big user of Windows and Linux and now have made the switch to mostly using my new 12in iBook.","My main bones of contention included 10 hours to back up 30-40G of data, and the computer\u0027s inability to run more than one program at once; Windows Explorer froze constantly requiring closure of the running program.I decided to give the laptop one more chance but the last straw occurred when a 6G backup took 4 hours and configuration of Windows updates took over 2 hours.","LA COMPRE EN TIGERDIRECT.NO LA COMPREN , ES UNA PC QUE NO LOGRARAN ENCENDERLA.NO COMPRAR, NO COMPREN, NO BUY IT!!!!!

It\u0027s also pretty cool that you can now run any media (videos, dvds, music, etc) full screen and it comes with a cool little remote control!The only thing I could take a point off for is that the new machines will no longer run OS 9 applications like the previous models do.","I bought this Macbook less than two weeks ago and have upgrade the memory from 1 GB to 2 GBs without any problem on my own! I called technical support before I ordered it and they were helpful and friendly! The new airport extreme is very valuable in picking up wi-fi signals! It boots up very fast and battery life is awesome! Small but powerful! You can even run windows on it - but don\u0027t care to! The new leopard operating system rocks! Buy one and you will never go back to PC or Windows!Sincerely,Jeff I bought this MacBook to replace a 12\" PowerBook G4 that died on me a few months ago, and let me just say - I absolutely love it.","There are still a few minor things missing, like the back-lit keyboard, which works under OS X but not yet under XP.Anyway, so far this is a gorgeous laptop for OS X or Windows XP.","Freebies are Comic Life, iLife (iMovie, iTunes, iDVD, iWeb, Garageband), and Omni Outliner.It took me roughly 2 hours to completely configure the new laptop the way I wanted it (most of the time taken up by installing Parallels (with Windows XP taking 45 minutes), Final Cut Studio, XCode, Office, Aperture, Freeway, and iWork).","A Wintel PC which claims a 2.8 GHz PC with windows and the same RAM, cannot match the power of this tinytot.","The Windows \u0026quot;experience\u0026quot; isn\u0027t as polished as with the Mac, but it\u0027s serviceable.","On this piece; you are throwing a fair percentage of that unit cost out the window.","The internet frequently crashes as does Windows Media Player.","The only manual driver installs I\u0027ve have done are the BIOS updates (installable from windows with 1.6 and later).- Working with an external monitor is annoying because:(a) Windows XP does not automatically identify the monitor and remember your desktop settings (MicroSoft\u0027s fault).(b) So when you plug in the monitor you have to manually click on \"extend my desktop\" (MicroSoft\u0027s fault)(c) With the Combo drive ejecting to the right of the unit and the video connector on the left, the monitor \"wants\" to sit on the left.","Wife liked it so much she took it over, so I got a iMAC 24\" !There are a few applications that haven\u0027t been developed as extensively(or at all) for Apple/MAC so you may wish to dual boot/boot camp it for those windows must have apps.Came with OS-X 10.4.10 will be upgrading it shortly to OS-X 10.5.","I\u0027ve traveled all over with my iBook, and it picks up all sorts of wireless connections to connect to the internet with.Having used Windows all my life, I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d be able to adapt to a new operating system.","The notebook can play a CD, DVD or photo card (MS, SD) without booting Windows.","I then spent at least a week downloading all kinds of Windows Vista Security Updates and other updates amounting to some 225 mega-bites using dialup.","However, being a \"computer person,\" I just backed up my files re-installed Windows, and it worked fine.Overall, great for the price, but I don\u0027t get why it sais $1500 on Amazon...","The software is certainly better and OS X is the best operating system compared to linux and Windows.","So far, the laptop has impressed me, no problems yet (unusual!)The 32 mb video ram, 30 gb hard drive, 1.6 P4-M and 512 mb ddr-sdram makes this laptop a great buy for the price! Before this Macbook Pro, I have had two $2,500 and $3,000 Windows machines, which did ok.This is the best computer I have ever used.","But it\u0027s the same thing- Frustrated that a lot of apps I was used to weren\u0027t available for the Mac- Occasionally, the screen would get \"scrambled\" and I would need to move windows around to refresh it- Battery life wasn\u0027t as good as I hoped.","I got the Windows for Mac and that makes it even better thought the software runs a little slow I don\u0027t care.","So I can only say once installed with Windows after I reformatted the hard drive it is FAST, reliable, and I find myself using it at home even with my dekstop quad core sitting about 6 feet away.","I needed Ultimate so I could change the language to Spanish, a feature Windows only allows possible in Ultimate.","pricy but not going back to windows hardware..","Congratulations I hope you keep this service The Dell C640 may be an older model yet it is surprisingly adroit with Windows XP SP3 running 512MB of RAM.","So, I can watch a movie WITHOUT all the extras HD DVD has! I decided to not restore my computer because if I do and this early version of WinDVD 8 does not play newer HD DVDs either, I will have to call someone to replace the window I will throw this laptop through.","I want to throw it out the window.","With Windows XP, in lieu of Vista, only 16 of the 60 GB hard drive is used...and that includes the full suite of Microsoft Office 2003 and several other larger programs.","I searched the internet and found Mac OS X applications to replace the ones I used under Windows, and they are as good or better.","The Windows Experience Index (Start | right click Computer | left click Properties) gives it a Vista capability score of only 3 out of 5.","Note that like previous Apple notebooks, it does NOT fully support 3D graphics even when running under Boot Camp and running Windows.","However on the bad news:1) NO GAMING!!...It\u0027s not even worth to install it on this...I\u0027ve tried the \"VERY LOW\" settings in Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth about a year ago but that\u0027s it (Btw, I dunno why but it can\u0027t play that game anymore)...With new PC stores in games now, I would not advise it...Plus the video card is like an Intel GMA or something even lower so I don\u0027t recommend it.2) MY BATTERY DIED!...I should say it\u0027s fortunate that my PC didn\u0027t die...only my laptop external battery die...It doesn\u0027t function anymore...now I always need a nearby power source to turn it on...and the wire isn\u0027t that long anyway..3) IT CAN\u0027T HANDLE WIRELESS N!!!

It will go into visual convulsions until it eventually settles down; want to install a program to rip your own music CDs? Expect to be nagged to death by error messages appearing every 3 minutes; want to print or scan? Sorry, incompatible; want to watch a video?

And quiet, this machine is quiet.","However, they \"updated\" it to Windows Vista instead of XP, and now it is totally useless to me as it doesn\u0027t work with my work network.","The windows experience index gives this machine a 3.1 out of 5... and it\u0027s all blames to the graphics.","To add to the impressiveness of this, all the necessary utilities and controls were there, just as if I had gone to HP\u0027s website and downloaded that stupid 50MB file.If you\u0027re planning on getting the Powerbook specifically, I\u0027ll give you some of the advantages of the mobile Mac over one of the various Windows bricks you could get.","LA COMPRE CON DUDAS PERO EN VERDAD SUPERO MIS ESPECTATIVAS, FUNCIONA PERFECTAMENTE SEGUN SU CAPACIDAD, VINO CON WINDOWS Xp Y OFFICE LISTA PARA USAR.","It can grow uncomfortable in heavy use - CPU and graphics card are the main contributors.- The headphones volume is quite low (what\u0027s up with that?!)- No advanced wireless config utility for built-in Broadcom 11g.And that\u0027s all! Now back to the good:- Amazing viewing angle - if you can see the surface you gonna see the image.- Drivers for 64 bit Windows XP are available now.- Speakers positioning and sound are awesome.- Sockets positioning is very good.","I purchased this laptop new in 2008 and it has worked like a charm! I immediately upgraded the memory to 4GB; although I knew with vista I could not take advantage of the entire 4GB.The Duo processor does support 64 bit , so I\u0027m upgrading to Windows 7 to finally use all 4GB memory and most of my applications should perform fine.I did use my extended warranty twice this year for damage I caused! The only issue I have is the fact it does not support the installation of a 2nd internal hard drive although the space is available but no connectors.But for the price I paid, I\u0027m happy! Got it from local CompUSA, the last week it was in bankruptcy business!One discrepancy, the laptop has 6 USB slots not 4 as indicated in the technical description.Toshiba Satellite P205-S6347 I purchased this laptop not too long ago, and so far, it\u0027s proven to be very nice.","Basically, the power supply unit on this laptop failed within the first month of use for no aparent reason, however the seller was very prompt and replaced the defective PSU right away.As for the laptop itself, it is very nice in a nice form factor (not too large or too small).The only bad thing is that I noticed windows tells me that it has only 384MB of RAM, which is wrong because the specs on amazon claime it has 512MB RAM, however before I rush to conclussions my guess is that the other 128MB are probably allocated to the video card (which in any case is missleading advertising), so I\u0027ll take a look at that and see what\u0027s going on.","The video card is not suitable for windows vista, also if want it working properly you must put it 4gb ram, plus a new hardrive spinning at 7200 RPM, or it works very slow, also the processor runs extremely hot and at 2,2 ghz it can barely keep up, the touchscreen feature is so inacurrate that is not useful (they should develop something like multitouch of machintosh). the wide screen is great for watching movies or t.v. and the flip up keyboard not only saves space but keeps it clean from dust.","I\u0027m having a great time discovering all the differences from my Windows machines and it seems each day I\u0027m finding some little thing that makes me go \"hmm- cool!\".","If are like I was, and considering a switch to Mac OS X, but still need to run Windows XP or Vista, you can do so via bootcamp, vmware, or parallels.","Now check this out, ATI MOBILITY Radeon X1400 graphics card, 128MB DDR that is Windows Vista ready.","I figured out from MAC Blogs that Quicken for MAC was not going to work for me, so I decided to try the free trial of Parallels (purchased after the trial) and loaded a copy of Windows XP Pro.","Windows XP Professional is included.","Had a tough time searching through forums and get drivers for all the devices and get this laptop working.My Conclusion is ALWAYS buy a good processor like AMD or Centrino for windows Vista.","We provide 7-day refund, and 90-day defective exchange gurantee....\"Also they offered Windows Vista Premium, and thenm their order confirmation e-mail said that the notebook had installed Windows XP but that is Windows Vista ready??They said in their order-confirmation e-mail...\"we are honest so we have to say this\".","I\u0027ve been a Windows/Unix user all my life.","I do not understand how this computer is so thick; other manufactuers have made their 17\" laptops amazingly thin.When I bought it at Circuit City, it came with many problems that included reinstalling Windows multiple times.","A remote would make it nice to use as part of an entertainment center.By the way, Amazon\u0027s specs aren\u0027t quite accurate - This laptop has 2 120gb hard drives for a total of 240gb, not 200gb.Another nice touch about this laptop is that this laptop\u0027s keyboard includes a separate area for a numeric keypad, which is nice - many laptops have a smaller keyboard with the numeric keypad where the letters are.Another thing I like about this laptop is that the HDMI output allows you to connect to modern high-definition TVs, and with an HDMI-DVI adapter, you can use a PC monitor with a digital connection.This laptop comes with Windows Vista installed.","Shining off the screen was something resembling a home video.It was a young woman sitting in front of a window holding a child and staring off into the clouds.","The screen is closed with a magnet, I like this very much!! The overall feel of the Macbook feels more fragile then some of the windows laptop, I tried Parallels briefly but could not get the USB items to work properly so I tried to uninstall Parallels and had some problems so I actually had to reinstall OS X, I personally dont think windows is a good match on any Mac just use a Mac as a Mac, you will then not have to worry about any instability or viruses, its just works.","Windows Vista takes some getting used to, but has great features (and I absolutely love Office 2007).Back to the computer- Overall, this laptop is great though.","I replaced my Sony Vaio SZ laptop with the MacBook Pro 2.4 so here is my review:First of all it wouldn\u0027t be fair to compare Mac OS X and Windows XP/Vista.","This shows in the magnificent performance both in office applications and 3D gaming.Lastly, Windows XP :) The soothsayers say \u0026quot;go for Pro, not home\u0026quot; and I can see why.","I bought this MacBook for my wife to use in law school even though the school required a PC and wouldn\u0027t give me any assurance that the MacBook loaded with Windows would be OK.","The video chipset is actually pretty good compared to what some (though not all) value laptops on the Windows side have.","Regardless, I am now connected to a printer via USB, and have no more problems with the iBook.In sum, I am a longtime Windows user who has made the transition to Mac OS X.","After subtracting space needed for creating the file system, HP\u0027s recovery partition, and Windows, you are left with just around 60gb to really use.Optical drive: the dvd burner works great, I\u0027ve had no problems with it.","But at the end of the day, that is still a Dell and this is art :) This is the closest thing to Apple/Mac styling you will get in the windows world.","The battery is strong enough to watch a 2-21/2 movie internet probably 4hrs plus on wireless and 6 on normall windows AP\u0027s .","Computer: dv8000z, Windows XP Media Center, 1 GB RAM, AMD 2.2 Gig TurionOne problem with a very nice computer caused me to return it (both of them).","I hope to kiss Windows good bye....","The 1.2 Ghz processor sounds small to Windows users, but it buries my old 2.0 Ghz Pentium3 that had 3 times the RAM of my little iBook.","Pro: Fabulous screen, great form factorCon: Unbelievably annoying fan, unreliable, mediocre build quality(note: I have the VGN-S260P - same notebook w/Pentium 735, smaller HD and only DVD-ROM)Sony is the closest thing the Windows world has to Apple level product design.","You need to purchase those software/windows xp home CD seperately.","Using Linksys Wireless-G Router (801.11b mode) I had a pretty good connection (30\u0027 + 1 Wall + 1 Window) however, while surfing the internet the network monitor was saying no connection.I have since installed XP Pro and have not been unable to get the wireless to work.Actual battery time is a little over stated as usual.","I have used Windows since Windows ME and I have never tried a Mac.","So, I purchased a new hard drive, installed it, and now my recovery cd\u0027s won\u0027t work because the graphics don\u0027t allow me to see the first window of the recovery process.","But its very apparant that this PC can\u0027t handle it which is why it locked up all the time.If you want the PC to run reliably, do yourself a favor and format the entire hard drive and reinstall windows on a clean drive.","Nothing like a Windows computer.","And, for that hookup, there is ANOTHER remote control -- a much bigger, full-size Windows Media Center remote.","After you\u0027ve had it for a month or two (ie after the 15-day return window) it will start shutting itself off randomly more and more often until it becomes useless.","For switchers who are having problems with how easy Macs are to connect online, printers, and other peripherals-you are just doing it wrong or probably still in Windows mentality.","My plan was to upgrade the Home Edition to Microsoft Windows XP Professional.To my shock, this computer comes only with a rescue disk.","This is a duron 900 with I think 16 shared and even using the windows media player absorbing 57 percent of resources it still won\u0027t play smoothly.","Nice.If you are using Windows (esp.","I have no issues with the screen (Matte - LG panel).Pros:- Mac OS X- Great preinstalled software package you don\u0027t have to waste your time with uninstalling the junk like on a windows laptop.- Size / Weight compared to other 15.4 laptops- everything regarding to the operation - fast, quiet, illuminating keyboard, magsafe power adapter ...- multiple options to install other operating system - I have Bootcamp / XP on it I only use it for my games.- I found all the other softwares that I needed for Mac.- wide range of custom designed accessories - you can spend a fortune on these :-)Cons:- only 2 USB ports- no multimedia card reader- no docking possibility- can be hot - I would recommend iLap that will solve the problem- fingerprint reader would be nice on a $2500 laptopMy conclusion:I don\u0027t take away stars for the cons because I knew all these things before I ordered my MBP and there weren\u0027t unexpected problems.","Compared to a previous SZ series, non carbon fiber models, I would say that this one is significantly lighter and thinner.I just feel that the new Windows Vista reduce the speed of the comp compared to a XP.I hope it gets better after updates.","very easily scratch!2. doesn\u0027t matter what apple say, a 800mhz running osX with 640M feel as fast as a pc 800mhz running win xp, not any faster or slower! but in 2003! where can you found a 800mhz window machine?3.","I hadn\u0027t used a Mac in years, but I decided I\u0027d had it with Microsoft and Windows.","Then, in a fit of insanity, I clicked \u0026quot;buy\u0026quot;

I\u0027m finally happy with the performance of Virtual PC 6.0 running Windows 2000 and Outlook XP; as a matter of fact I\u0027ve duplicated my Windows work laptop in VPC and no longer have to carry two machines around- Movies are incredible on the big screen, and the speakers have great stereo separation (to the point that sometimes working late at night, I think I hear someone in the room, and it turns out to be part of the song)- It\u0027s quite thin, even compared to the 12\u0026quot;, which is good on my wrists when typingNegatives:- Trying to get around the massive screen with the touchpad is a chore; get an external mouse ASAP- Sitting in bed working on e-mail can be a bit difficult, because if you end up slanting the PowerBook upwards, the cover wants to close- Even though this is one of the smallest 17\u0026quot; laptops out there, you just can\u0027t get away from the fact that it\u0027s a big monster of a machine when you spread out on a desk, airplane tray table, or other area I bought a product that is almost the same as this one (U205-S5058 instead of U205-S5057) at another store ($1200 before tax; the same specs except Vista Business), and I have been using it for about three weeks now.","If you really like Sony TX series as I do, you have two options: 1) Buy the TXN15/17/19 series which run on Windows XP. 2) Buy this one and replace Vista with XP.","I really enjoy not having to scan for spyware at all with my new notebook.So far as the Windows vs. Apple debate goes, -- yes, Mac OS X is an extremely stable system.","The customer support with Apple (for questions and in-store training) is the best.Buy with confidence! my macbook pro has made difficult things on windows into simple tasks, i don\u0027t know what i\u0027d do without it My MacBook started RSDs last Friday the 13th after using it for 2 months.","Been a Windows user all my life.","I have only taken it to campus tech services once when Windows wouldn\u0027t load after a crash.","If you want to experience the latest Windows Media Center 2005 edition software, this machine is not the right one.","OS X\u0027s command shell (Bash) allows you to actually get things done easily -- not true of the standard Windows shell.","The biggest drawback that this laptop has is it\u0027s lack of memory capacity from the factory for Windows XP.","I was fed up with constant crashes (probably didn\u0027t help that I was running Windows ME), viruses, Microsoft always adding new features without really fixing core problems, etc so after reading so much about Apple products I decided to switch.","I agree, that it is so much more stable than Windows.","I installed windows XP in a seperate partition and there were no drivers for the devices for XP to download.","Personally, I move mine all over the house but rarely take it out of the house.This computer is windows Vista ready with one caveat; most experts agree that 2 gigs of RAM will be necessary to fully enjoy Vista.","The laptop came with Windows Home Edition, yet my friend installed a Windows XP.","The battery is generally good for 3-5 hours depending what your running.I\u0027ve always had Macs as a personal use computer and was really debatiing getting a regular PC since like most people, I use Windows in my workplace.","I also updated to Windows 7 and anticipate trying Windows 8.Just a note that unless you are ept and can adjust to the exterenal wrld without help from the manufaturer this may not be the best way to go.","I am also not happy with the performance of this laptop - not sure its windows or the hardware tho.","As a college student I struggled with the decision between purchasing a Windows laptop or a MacBook, but due to all the horror stories out there about Vista imcompatibility and my previous Windows nightmares, I decided to give Mac a try.","She told me my brand new 2.0 GHz, 256 MB computer with XP Pro \u0026quot;probably doesn\u0027t have enough space on the hard drive to run the program.\u0026quot; When I insisted my laptop met minimum requirements she told me it must be a Windows OS problem! Moral? Dude, I\u0027m getting a Dell! After five months the LCD stared leaking from the upper right hand corner.","This partition can probably be deleted after making recovery disks, but this would likely require a re-install of Windows.","Yes, I am a Mac user, but I can guarantee that you will fall in love with this machine if you\u0027re coming over from Windows.","I have never had any trouble with Windows XP Pro or Windows 2000.","For anyone interested in an objective comparison of Apple and Windows products, I suggest checking out The Wall Street Journal technology collumnist Walter Mossberg\u0027s article \" Tempted By The Apple?\", Nov. 10 2005, at Smartmoney.com.","It was nearly like working on windows (Haha!!!).This is not a topic to talk about with a switching user anymore.","Running Windows is frankly distasteful, and you easily see why I stick to the mac side as much as possible, but Parallels makes it as easy and stable as it can be.","Although this is not the latest technology, I was able to download Windows 8 and it works perfect for surfing the interent and doing reports for school.","This notebook computer is my fourth computer, with my first being a Windows 95 machine when I was 6.","On the second point, since all other applications have performed near-flawlessly, I will assume Apple still has some work to do on Front Row.From a business standpoint, using Office and QuickBooks on the Mac, and having the ability to load Parallels to run Windows if I encounter an application not native for the Mac), means I can operate in a largely Windows world without having to worry about viruses, malware, etc. (at least, for now).","Windows Vista tends to slow down when you click the Start Button \u003eAll Programs.","For those who are not familiar with it, this new feature in Panther will allow you to push F9 on the keyboard and show every window that is open.","When running windows the laptop can get very warm.3.","another five seconds to close the window to place the message in the Outbox.","Tested on Knoppix, Debian, Fedora Core 2, and of course Windows XP Pro.-Jameson I bought this notebook almost 1 year ago.","Also, this is my first Mac in almost eight years (I\u0027ve been using Windows since 1999), so the OS is pretty much new to me.","This is good because it keeps Windows segregated from messing with your Mac and you can play your favorite game (mine is SolSuite) or application from your PC that you just can\u0027t give up.","It runs Windows XP( although I dont know why in the world if you have Omac\u0027s OS X youd even want XP.)","When I\u0027m in a window in IE and want to go to another site in Favorites, it opens a 2nd window rather than just go to the site.","The low points are: Windows XP preinstalled(as always), no Windows XP CD but Toshiba recovery... so, no posibility to install both OS, and lack of PS2 ports.","This battery is junk.So, the bottom line appears to be this: budget $130 every year to buy a new battery.Frankly, I\u0027m inclined to slink back to a Windows machine with my next purchase.","And with VMware Fusion it makes it very easy to run most windows programs if I need too, except for games, which I can just run in Boot Camp.","If the machine doesn\u0027t spontaneously shut off, Windows \"detects a problem\" and \"shuts down to prevent damage to your computer.\"It\u0027s a wash.","They tell me they need to do a system restore.They send it back.I boot up.Windows error message:\"Windows cannot start because the file comdlg32.dll cannot be found.","Mine has 40 GB hard drive (it boots in either Windows XP, or Red Hat Linux), and 1 Gigabyte of RAM, the maximum amount this model can be upgraded to.","I made the switch from Windows to Apple in 2000 and have been glad I did ever since.","I have been frustrated by my Windows XP machine for months now.","Two seconds later you could see that it was a man playing ping pong, two friends standing by the window with beer cups in hand, and that the carpet was green.","Not sure why Sony lists this limit if it works this way, but 384 max is just way too low (for the memory hog that Windows XP is).3) Sony\u0027s accessories are PRICY.","Still there are many errors with setting up bootcamp for usingmicrosoft windows system.","Isn\u0027t that what every DVD player on the planet should do? Yet, not only do Windows-based DVD player not do that, they either have some of the ugliest interfaces in the software world (WinDVD) or install a lot of crapware on your system that makes ad windows pop up all the time (real player).","For instance, Java would like to download updates, but my operating system freezes everytime in mid installation.Also, I bought the Windows Fun Pack with the extra games and screen savers, etc.","If you are having hassles with windows or are thinking of switching over I would highly reccomend this notebook.","tiger is stable, beautiful, and when you need windows (i just only use it for games): just use bootcamp Perfect with the D-dock.","I am currently dual-booting with Ubuntu Gusty and Windows XP professional.","Windows is sloppy, virus prone and doesn\u0027t operate smoothly with its hardware as Mac products do.","Maybe next time, I\u0027ll even consider a 20-inch laptop.Now that you can run Windows on top of Mac OS with Parallels Desktop or dual-boot to Windows with Boot Camp, isn\u0027t it time to consider a Mac laptop? As a recovering PC-user, I can tell you that I\u0027m glad I switched and I\u0027ll never switch back! Great features, lots of speed and room, big keyboard, 10-key pad and all the ports you would want!Aside from the weight, this has been a wonderful and reliable laptop for my business.","The stability, reliability, and usability of the Mac is what Windows should have become years ago.","This computer is great and easy to use, and it now has WINDOWS XP!!! Apple MacBook MB063LL/A 13.3\" Notebook PC (2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, 8x SuperDrive) BlackMy daughter loves it! It is easy to use and does everything a student needs without problem.","There is still a lot of un-updated applications, and things will run SLOWER than on a normal Windows PC.","And the kicker is that with VMFusion my new Mac runs my irreplaceable Windows programs faster than they ran on my Windows XP PC.","But attention: if you are going to use another Operational System in this Vaio, Know that Sony only support drivers for Windows Vista.","I\u0027ve had two circumstances where Windows Update and Toshiba\u0027s utility would both select drivers, with one outdating the other.","There is a decent software translation of Windows XP for purchase for ultimate compatability.","Users can run 15-20 different major tasks simultaneously without noticing a great deal of lag, unlike on Windows.","It has everything a Windows XP computer should have, at about the size of a 4x6 index card, and less than an inch thick.","It will lock up but not as often as Windows... in fact, it has only locked up 3 times since I got the laptop on Nov 24 and I use it every day.I have really learned to enjoy the difference between platforms and although they\u0027re both flawed systems, OS X is the winner in this category.","It crashes much more frequently than my recent Windows machines, which says a lot, since Windows is none too trustworthy.That said, I like the physical layout, the size \u0026 weight, and the Mac applications.","Lenovo sent a refurbished hard drive as a replacement right away but instead of preinstalling Windows on it like you get when you buy the computer, they send a set of 7 CDs with very detailed and convoluted instructions that fail to mention you have to press F1 and set the BIOS to compatibility mode before installing the OS.","Many people would be better served spending the $79 on this package than the $300-400 for MS Office because Pages is simple to use and has great templates - and it can save easily to PDF or DOC or other formats to share with Windows.","I personally had very few problems with Windows XP, but it isn\u0027t just about the stability of Mac OS X its about the ease of use, integration and beauty of the system.","In fact, you\u0027ll find that many windows users are downgrading back to XP.","And, the ability to run Windows at near-native speed using Parallels Desktop makes it almost perfect.","But I am not entirely in the Apple camp as yet - Windows-based notebooks have a lot to offer if you know how to configure them properly and are certainly good value for the money.","I had to see what Windows Vista was like (and since my laptop has Windows XP Media Center edition 2005 on it) here I am.","I bought this laptop mainly because of the new Windows Vista OS.I Took it right out of the box and it\u0027s was very easy to set up.It has 3 USB ports,120 gigs of hardrive memory which is pretty big for right now but I plan to add more in the future, 1 gig DDR2 RAM, a dvd burner, and more.I play alot online with games like Counter strike and Half life 2 on the steam engine.The game play is fast it doesnt\u0027t lag.I showed my friend and he loved this laptop we played CS with no lag and fast load times.It has a decent processor AMD Turion 64X2 dual core.I got the Notebook primarly for school but I seem to be using for anything but that.","But a problem occurred with Windows XP Media Center.","I was done with windows and all the frustration that users are just expected to deal with.","Windows Vista is likely the most doggy, system crippling operating system I have come across since windows 95 came out and was installed on a 386 sx.If you have an option try to stay with XP, its more stable it operates faster and certainly wont cripple your hardware with all its bloat!As far as the laptop is concerned, I love the wide screen, This is a desktop replacement type of laptop.","Last gen games such as FarCry run fine though.If you\u0027re eyeing Windows Vista, wait.","It does take a little getting used to if you aren\u0027t familiar with Macs, but once you get a good feel for where everything is located you realize that the system is much more intuitive and geared to the user than windows.","When the dial is at the highest level, the volume is still much lower than when DVDs are played back on Windows, and you can\u0027t really hear much from the speakers, so you must instead use headphones.","Once you purchase it, you will realize that you wont have many of the functionality of Windows Media Center 2005 such as concurrent record and play, better interface etc.","First off I love my Macbook because it provides more stability than my windows machines.","You normally have to fork out truckloads of dollars for this!- Windows XP Pro and Vista ready.","Also, the Sony has touchpad shortcuts to close windows (tap top-left corner and drag down-right) and scroll windows vertically (slide along right of touchpad) and scroll horizontally (slide along bottom).The LCD is XGA, but contrary to what another reviewer said, VGA and SVGA will look fine and scale to full screen IF you get the latest Intel 830MG chipset graphics driver from Intel\u0027s website.","I will be upgrading my wife and kids computers to Apple products and we will never go back.This machine is old and is far superior to my wife\u0027s much newer windows machine.","And many other niceties.What does this have to do with Windows? Well, no other notebook I know of is built like this... but more importantly, the attention to detail and craftmanship applies to the operating system as well.","The insert and delete keys are just to the right of the space bar, the Windows key is at the top right.","Haven\u0027t had any problems at all! The switch from Windows to Apple was not as big a change as I thought it would be.","Oh, and it has Windows XP Pro.","The only difference between the two is the OS; Windows XP Home for the S301, and Windows XP Professional for the S302.","Windows XP Professional preinstalled.","This is a great for the price, with Windows XP.","It works pretty well -- I\u0027ve had no crashes, no blue screens of death, etc. like I was used to getting with Windows 95 and 98.","I use this notebook as my desktop replacement.- Hard drive space: 20GB is huge for what I do.- Little scroll button: quite helpful.- Speakers: JBL Pro are absolutely the best.- Combo DVD/CD-RW Drive: more convenient than swapping like Gateway.Things I dislike:- Little buttons at the top of the keyboard: Can\u0027t figure out how to change what they do.- Windows XP: Takes a while getting used to compared to Windows 98.- The stupid sticker that came on the screen: A bugger to get off, I still have a little stickiness on the screen.- The stickers advertising AMD and Windows XP on the corner of the keyboard: I have scratched my arm several times.That\u0027s about it.","I bought this little machine after about 2 months of research, it began as a curiosity and then I have to admit my fustration with windows pushed me to seriously consider it.","Random shut offs of the wireless continued.- Sometimes networking would still be \"active\" and Windows would indicate there were networks available but would not locate any when asked.","I am able to share files with my Windows PCs (although Norton IS 2005 creates some issues since the Mac is wireless - a problem on any platform) and am online anywhere in my house.","I have to mention that when you shop for other laptops, like Dell, you usually have to pay extra for these features.FEATURES THAT ARE EXCLUSIVE TO THINKPADFast Recovery system: Built in a hidden partition of the hard drive, allows easy and fast system recovery even when you cannot enter the Windows systemFingerprint Security System: Only ThinkPad has a built-in fingerprint scanner.","When I used to compare it with my personal windows laptop, actually I could not compare...there was nothing to compare.","La opci\u0026oacute;n que te ofrecen es que te compres una licencia del Windows Vista Business porque es el \u0026uacute;nico que tiene una opci\u0026oacute;n para hacer un downgrade al XP.","The iBook G4 is simply awesome! I am/was a windows fan, born and raised.","So I ended up holding the power button for a short while after which the notebook started asking for a bios level password (which I had never set) and stopped loading Windows.","The software that it comes with is very useful, and handy, and not as annoying as say, windows media player..","I also just wanted to try a new operating system (Not that I particularly dislike Windows, but I find it kind of boring and it makes me feel like I\u0027m doing tedious office work.).I\u0027m not sure if I need to talk about the iBook\u0027s design, it\u0027s obviously the best looking notebook out there (besides the Powerbook).","I have to say though, the day I bought it, I IMMEDIATELY reinstalled Windows Vista and reinstalled the drivers.","(A 12\" display is not comfortable to use all day long, but that is the trade-off for portability.)I am very experienced with the various versions of Windows (since 3.1) and I must say that I like Vista quite a bit.","She had McAfee and it ruined the registry on her Windows 98.","I don\u0027t know if this is an issue of Windows Xp Tablet Edition.After these two issued, excellent machine.","Voil\u0026aacute;! Now I\u0027m a very satisfied MacBook owner, using Mac OS applications most of the time, and switching to Windows almost seamlessly, when I need to.","Having the tech support folks tell me I need to \"update my windows USB drivers\" isn\u0027t something I plan to put myself through.","I think Windows Vista is a Joke....","So a quick rundown:Pros:-Glossy shell and glossy screen make for beautiful laptop inside and out-Powerfull new processor-cool features such as webcam, dvd writable drive, magnetic latch and power cord, spaced out keys for my big hands-reasonably priced for what you get-long battery life compared to previous laptops I\u0027ve owned-Supports a wide range of software including Microsoft Office and Windows.","If you choose Apple\u0027s Boot Camp (a free public beta download), you can boot your Intel MBP to run either Mac OS X or Windows XP.","I also installed Windows XP on it and face no problem at all.","Everyone knows you need to reinstall Windows every year or two to clean out the junk.","But I must add, even though I work in the IT field, this computer was purchased to meet personal needs, and that it does quite well if you understand the limitations Sony had to work with in making it so small.It truly is a fully functional Windows Vista computer that will hook to you belt and every one thinks you are carrying some oversized cell phone or camera.Just make sure you are prepared for the tiny fonts and limited screen capabilities.","The only problem I\u0027ve had with this was when I tried to run Windows XP Pro on it.","(We use both in our office and as the owner of the company I\u0027m the default IT guy.)We could have bought equivalent processing speed and features about 20% cheaper with Windows, but I would be the one who had to maintain the things so we went with these MacBooks.One of the best decisions I\u0027ve made this year.They worked great out of the box for what the girls wanted to do.","Like it or not, I\u0027ve used Windows/PC for the past 12 years.","All my Windows applications run, without exception so far.","The open-apple key works as the \"alt\" key worked in Windows.","They both look identical from just looking at them.Rick Make sure you have Windows XP Pro (SP2) installation disk and do a CLEAN install of everything.","Amazing for a windows machine.5.","Finally, after 1 month of searching on the web for an affordable laptop i found this laptop, it\u0027s just as i want, cheap basic laptop with nice design and properties, me and my friend bought 2 of it, i found it quick as much as I need, it has a little bit slow startup because of the Windows Vista and the only 1 GB RAM memory, but once it start it turn fast and smooth, the screen also is great, but it\u0027s slightly heavy.","Macs are inherently more secure than Windows machines.","Adobe Photoshop Elements 3 is a welcome addition, and the graphics card and specs are Windows Vista ready for all you future-proofers!I also found myself really liking some of the features I was apathetic of at first.","If you ever have to run out the door, all you do is close the lid and go, no more Start, Shutdown and then the long silence that ensues while you wait for Windows to close all your programs.","It took me a while to get used to it, but I like Window\u0027s newest OS a lot better than XP.","That is why I have to actually install and boot multiple operating systems rather than use an emulation product or even VMWare.I had no problems getting this to quadruple-boot Vista64; Fedora LINUX; Windows 2008 and OS X. Didn\u0027t get a chance to try Solaris or BSD, but it probably would have worked fine.I didn\u0027t run into any software compatibility problems other than some printer-driver limitations.","I can now use the wonderful Mac OSX most of the time, but boot up in Windows on the Macbook Pro when I have to run a Windows only program.","There\u0027s all sorts of programs that came with my MacBook Pro that the school AT brags about having bought for the Windows XP computers.","Runs fast, good memory \u0026 storage, Windows XP is great, much easier to use than windows 7.","I thought I\u0027d try the alternative to Windows machines, and it\u0027s been a big disappointment.","I was nervous about buying a new computer with Windows Vista, but, this computer is sweet! It is fast and has improved my ability to communicate with my office significantly.","As soon as I unplug it, the computer shuts down with no saving then has to reboot from start.Rosetta not kicking in either and the Mac techs at the local shop don\u0027t know how to turn it on...oh boy! I stick to ALL mac products since to load windows will leave me no space to have FUN!Good thing I have applecare....right? THE GOOD THING: I saved $600 off retail here at Amazon! :) I rated it 1 star because it won\u0027t allow me to rate it lower than that.","Add to that a belkin wireless N router and let me tell you this machine screams!! Boot up time of this mac verses a windows pc you really can\u0027t compare the two.","Simple to set up and easy to use.Only negative - Windows did not include a backup copy in case of a problem with software - in fact no OEM software had their original disc in case of a problem.","Not a big deal, since I have to go to the printer to retrieve my documents anyway.The OS is easy to use and much cleaner than Windows.","Also this computer runs slow at the factory installed 1 GB total RAM so I had to pay extra to get it to 2 GB and I am unsure if it works considering the Windows Vista \"drainage\".","I have owned Macs previously and also regularly use Windows PCs since there is some software that I like that only runs on the Windows machines.","Before I left high school I was told I would need a labtop that used the Windows Operating System because that\u0027s what \u0026quot;everyone else uses.\u0026quot; I bought an IBM Thinkpad T30 (the T30 was new and very highly regarded at the time).","Never have to deal with any of that craziness like spyware that many novice windows users believe is \u0027normal\u0027 for using a computer.I converted a company that had 10 PC\u0027s and 2 Mac\u0027s to become an 11 Mac and 2 PC office.","These new Macs can also run windows, but you\u0027ll have to buy a copy of Windows to run on them.","They should ship this product with a disclaimer though, in the past twenty four hours, i\u0027ve left the house twice and both times i couldn\u0027t wait to get back and play with my toy. buyers remorse? only for windows chumps.","This is similar to my hesitation to jump to XP from ME and from Windows 98 to ME, but I have not had any serious problems yet.","I was concerned that the PB (1.33GHz) wouldn\u0027t be as fast as a Windows notebook (some of which run at 3Ghz or more.)The only way to find out was to go to the Apple store in my hometown and play with a Powerbook in person.","changing all the security settings, spread across multiple programs and areas of Windows didn\u0027t help.","Even for a Windows user.The iBook is another Home run from Apple.","I know we MS junkies are all waiting for Vista to salvage Windows (and Bill\u0027s $$$ advantage over Warren), but IMHO it\u0027s simply going to be a quasi knock-off of OSX.","I have had this notebook for about 3 months, and the Hard drive faild on me 3 times! I re installed windows vista 3 times and the problem kept happening.","It is just the best machine out there, for everything.Put the OS on top of it, and you get a perfect user experience.Especially that using BootCamp or other softwares you can now run Windows on it.I never wrote a recommendation without reservations, but here is one.","First off, the big disappointments... those staple programs of your PC either don\u0027t look too great on the Mac (Word \u0026 Excel), are difficult to emulate in Mac dedicated software (Outlook in particular), don\u0027t work on it at all (MS Publisher, Autoroute and the wonderful Digiguide), or, in the case of Adobe Photoshop \u0026 InDesign, run noticeably slower... isn\u0027t the Mac supposed to be the best thing out there for imaging \u0026 DTP? Sure, the imminent new releases of both Adobe programs are supposed to rectify this problem but hey, we\u0027re on a top end machine here with the current versions of two of the Mac\u0027s \"signature\" programs.And the good news? Well, Apple\u0027s \"Pages\" is an incompatible but wonderfully powerful alternative to Publisher - you won\u0027t want to go back - the Mac\u0027s Utilities (hidden in the Applications folder) are simple to use and brilliantly effective, the installation of a wireless network using Airport Extreme \u0026 Express units is remarkably straightforward, that is once you\u0027ve figured out that you use the Mac (not any of the PC\u0027s connected to the network) as the machine on which the configuration settings are made, and the whole \"feel\" of the OSX environment inspires confidence, making you want to keep exploring new Mac applications.But that\u0027s only the start of it... because what makes this machine so stunningly impressive for any Windows user is what it does once you install and correctly configure \"Parallels\", the Mac\u0027s recently released \"killer\" application that lets you run Windows as though it\u0027s just another Mac application.","With Parallels running Windows XP, it it really the ultimate laptop solution for everyone to get the best of both worlds.BTW, this machine is very quiet and you can hardly hear its fan noise unleas you are running tye CPU 100%.","Before you judge this laptop too harshly, I have to say that most of the reviews are over looking one important fact: you\u0027re running Windows XP! That OS is a prime example of a resource hog (tho not as bad as Vista) I\u0027ve never had any problems with the laptop when I\u0027m running linux on it, and it seems to run much better (cooler, faster, more compatibly) with the latest linux distro of choice than it ever did on Windows.I guess the point of this review is to say that this laptop isn\u0027t for everyone, but it isn\u0027t crap, it just wasn\u0027t made for Windows.","So I decided to get the iBook to replace my Windows-based notebook PC.","I have not had my Ibook long enough to make a statement of fact.What I do know, however, with Windows - and this covers XP, ME, 98 and 95 - I\u0027ve had to wipe my hard drive and do a clean install at least once a year because Windows simply stopped working.","Also, if I sell this in a couple of years, wiping and reformatting the HD then restoring Windows from these disks will provide a clean drive for the next owner.It comes with Intervideo WINDVD which played my first DVD movie flawlessly with no setup required - I just inserted the disk and enjoyed excellent quality video on the display.","Since I\u0027m a complete novice, or was, I purchased this used iBook mainly to check it out and learn how Apple works differently than Windows.","AMF for Windows HDTV it was the only player that played them smoothly, sharply, with no frame drops, locks or skipping.The speakers are functional but extremely tiny, so don\u0027t expect any bottom end or high volume out of them at all.","The main problem I had was simply adapting to Windows Vista.","I you want to use Windows, you will need to purchase a new Windows XP SP2 single disk version; If you want Office tools, likewise, though many use the Mac version of Word and Excel.What is hard to get used to? No \u0027delete\u0027 key (Mac has a \u0027delete\u0027 key, but it functions as a backspace) When you are in the Windows environment, you have to use mouse \u0027click\u0027 functions to delete things.","This computer has the Premium Vista system, 1GB memory, CD/DVD burner w/lightscribe, 60 harddrive, Windows Media Center, and much more.","Will I become a total Mac convert and leave Windows?

I put Windows XP Professional on instead of the Media Center and it still does it.I like to play Battlefield 2.","I\u0027ve already learned that I\u0027m making it much harder on myself in trying to figure out how to work on the Mac because I am trying to work like I did on my Windows machine.The best part about the whole experience, is Boot Camp.","I run Firefox for web browsing, Office XP, and Windows XP home.","I switched it on, and could start work immediatedly.The iTunes music package is like Windows Media Player, Winamp, CDEX and Nero combined.","Windows users have to be careful not to make things more complicated than they need to be.","This computer (or rather windows vista) is miserably slow even with 2 full Gig of Ram.","A few weeks ago I became determined to wean myself off of Windows.","They have all been PC\u0027s, but I got sick and tired of crashes and that dreaded \u0026quot;end program now\u0026quot; prompting from Windows Xp.","Also, most Windows laptops do not offer a DVI port but the Macbook allows you to use DVI with an option $20 adaptor - this was another thing that sealed the deal for me.","Vista) or are having \"Windows Angst\", then I can tell you as a longtime Windows user (since Windows 3.1 \u0026 DOS 5.0) that the Mac is truly the best computer for simply getting work done and a more efficient workflow.For example; I am usually typing in Word \u002708, designing the coversheet in Pages, listening to music in iTunes, uploading photos to Flickr, updating my iDisk, and printing a photo in iPhoto.","The sales guys are amaazing, but not the tech support!they just ridiculed me by saying \"dont you know you cant return this thing?\" pl call the tech support!I always used to wonder why apple is not as successful as dell or windows based vendors.... the reason, the tech support is no where near dell/microsoft.","I bought this machine for primarily this purpose as I am deleting all windows on it and replacing it with Ubuntu Linux.Other than that, it is a sweet machine.","Start with the positive: all that garbage you hate about Windows machines is gone.","I knew the Apple machines were userfriendly, but after I bought my first Mac (This 12\" iBook) after years of Intel and AMD windows machines I fell in love immediatedly.The thing that appeals to me most is the fact that everything I needed was already on the machine...","Windows, NEVER AGAIN.","Just be aware your computer gaming choices will be limited somewhat, as should be expected from an older system.One potential drawback for the Toshiba is that it may not have enough power to handle Windows Vista.","I (along with 99.9% of everyone else using a PC and Windows) am still using a 32-bit OS.","I just bought the dv2221us, which is the same as this except for it comes w/ vista business (I got anxious and couldn\u0027t wait for this one to come out) Windows vista is great, easy to use and really looks and works amazing.","You have to boot into Windows before using QuickPlay.","Not to mention, this laptop WILL run Windows XP if I decided to go back.","I am using products within the iLife suite and more.When it is possible to install Windows products without installing Windows XP either later this month (July) or August, I will add my favorite PC programs.","You also have the Google window that opens up on boot, and IMO, it is annoying.","Not only does Apple make wireless connection easy to use, but a lot of Wintel users don\u0027t know that Mac is not as vulnerable to viruses as they are! About almost 75-95% of viruses created are made to target Windows users.","The start of Windows was slow after a year of usage but I used RegSeeker and now it works like a brand new notebook.","Ever so much better than any of the newer Windows computers around the house.","The touch sensitive media buttons offer quick media access, lower the volume, mute, pause rewind etc...The laptop is finished in a high gloss finish but surprisingly doesn\u0027t show finger prints much, using the provided microfiber cloth will remove any once visible, the screen is also a glossy finish and is very reflective to remedy this simply increase the screen brightness by holding fn and pressing f8, with the screen on maximum brightness any glare is gone, lower the screen brightness while in unlit rooms by holding fn and pressing f7.Vista Premium on this laptop is extremely fast, I have played both Gears of War and Resident Evil 4 on high settings very responsive, no poor frame rates, photo editing is wonderful as well as video editing, windows Media Center is wonderful again Vista has given me no issues and I love it, waiting to see what the SP1 update offers, you can get either the advertised laptop from amazon which is very similar to mine 100mghz faster cpu won\u0027t be noticeable but the lower heat and better efficiency my 45nm cpu offers makes me happy.The laptop is very thin, sleek well designed and light being a 15.4 inch screen, 250 gig hard drive offers amazing capacity and I already have several games on my hard drive as well as hundreds of pictures with about 1500 songs still 178 gigs left, I highly recommended this laptop and have been using mine bought from Hp for one month now only problem I encountered was when I left my 4 gig usb flashed drive plugged in and tried booting my laptop it froze simply removing the drive and restarting worked.","I find myself using Windows only for gaming, CS2, or Microsoft Office.","It does not have the nice tactile feel that the Apple Powerbooks and the better Windows notebooks possess.","Each time I experience this, I was tempted to press CTRL + ALT + DELETE (in typical Windows fashion) but after waiting a few seconds, my programs would run as usual.","There are some known problems with the macbook pros but that is no reason to go to windows.","I use mac for general web browsing and switch over to windows (on the same laptop ) to work on technical software.........really grt........nothing to loose.","(Yes, it looks like a stained glass window.)","That simple! My previous laptop - Dell Insipiron - took some windows configuration which if you\u0027re new to wireless connectivity could take awhile to get used to.","I find that if I\u0027m not paying attention, my finger wanders onto the scrollpad and the mouse pointer stops moving (even worse the window I\u0027m viewing scrolls around- annoying).","By that I mean it has the Core 2 Duo processor and comes with Windows Vista.","I can\u0027t explain it any better than that; you must use the Mac operating system to understand.Many users may be concerned about speed, by which I mean that the iBook has an 800 MHz processor while a similarly priced Windows notebook might have processor between 1.6-2.4 GHz processor.","There are more than 150 other big and small improvement (wait\u0027ll you get a load of a feature called Expos\u0026eacute;, which displays all your open windows, across applications, at the roll of a mouse!), but this is supposed to be a review about the computer, not its operating system.Well then, the G4 17\u0027\u0027 Powerbook is a tactile and esthetic pleasure to use.","It always worked, it was fast, it was light, and it had a button to turn off the wireless from the keyboard (a feature which I loved - Windows makes it really hard to do).","Maybe you\u0027re new to laptops, so here are a few facts.Sadly enough almost all laptops are tailored for Windows, that means that if you install anything but windows, well you\u0027ll have a poor performance.Also very important, the hard drive that is included with the computer is a 4200rpm HD which is QUITE slow for any standard.When the OS is paging or accessing the HD this speed is critical.I don\u0027t know about your computer but mine had 512mb of memory, and let\u0027s say the full 2Gb could really boost performance.I am a software engineer and I have found this laptop as a decent desktop replacement.If you use it with windowsXP 64, a fast HD and 1GB or more you\u0027ll see what I am talking about.","This computer won\u0027t make you regret the considerable investment though, it is well worth it if premium is a priority, and optional windows 7 expands its capabilities a lot! This computer is a wonderful laptop computer with a nice screen size.","Also when starting windows for the first time, it FORCES you to install MacAfee Security Center; something I have no desire in using as I already have my own firewall and antivirus software which I am perfectly happy with.","Being accustomed to the Windows operating system I had some worries about adjusting to apple.","The remote control does not work all the time, and does not follow function with windows media player.","I was on the edge of my feet, I couldn\u0027t decide if I should go with the iBook with Mac OS X or another laptop with Windows.","If anyone wants to check their CPU speed and they have a Windows OS, they can click on the following: START -\u003e CONTROL PANEL-\u003e SYSTEM -\u003e GENERAL and read the CPU value.","Vista takes a bit of getting used to (still prefer XP), but will strip out a lot of the time / space wasting features and get it a bit faster and more straightforward to use (I\u0027m a Windows Classic throwback).","Pros:- Price- Design (white)Cons:- Drivers for Windows XP not available- Weight and size (my God it\u0027s heavy) Pros: Price, Screen size, Full size keyboardCons: It comes with toll free number for assistance.","it would be better to spend a little more and get a better configured laptop with more memory.startup takes forever, closing a window takes a minute (computer hangs during that time) and there is absolutely no feeling of the dual core processor.","I am an advanced and long time windows user.","I only used the laptop for teaching and since this was only a bit more expensive than the other Windows based laptops I was looking at, I decided to go for it.","It is Windows Vista capable.","Of course this laptop has inferior specs compared to computers today, but you can still do basic things like browse the internet, write papers, synthesize music (yes it comes with garageband), photoshop, some games, etc.Its operating system is immune to all windows viruses.","Any of the numerous Mac forums are filled with discussions of software incompatibility and kernel panics (the Mac equivalent of the blue screen of death).Software Availability: Some publishers were willing to exchange my Windows applications for their Mac equivalents for free or for a small fee.","Imagine a world without pop-ups, spy ware, viruses, and other annoying things associated with Windows.","But to be honest, Windows on a Mac is a novelty - you can do just about anything in OSX minus PC games obviously.","i think the trouble has more to do with MS Windows and software than the hardware or anything else.","It is still so powerful I can\u0027t imagine ever needing to buy another laptop, I mean I can play windows games in parallels on it while browsing the web in OSX with out even a hiccup.","The defaults are set to maximize and minimize, the Alt key (to access menus), and the Windows key.","Just dont expect windows to come with this so you might be spending another 200 bucks for the os but I wouldnt use windows anyways just try Linux.","In a corporate setting, the optional port expander is a useful accessory.Amazon carries several configurations of the T22, with different combinations of CPUs and screen sizes (900 MHz/14.1\u0026quot; versus 800 MHz/13.2\u0026quot;) and operating system (Windows 98 versus Windows 2000).","I recently installed Windows 7, which I am not happy with on this laptop as it runs slower now, so I suggest sticking with XP.","Many widgets are available as freeware... and they allow you to check the weather, find the cheapest gasoline in your area, find guitar chords, etc.Networking with my Windows PC was also surprisingly easy, thanks to tutorials found on Google and Apple\u0027s tech support site.","Always wanted to try a MAC versus Microsoft Windows.","I only use Windows for a Money program I like that is not for Mac but hey... Mac OS and Windows XP on one maching is awesome.","I was never able to do this on my old Windows PC (3.4GHz P4).6.","if you can point me in the direction of one person who works on a windows (or even linux) system and has been able to do what i have in the time i have, and maintain the system without a headache for even a month, then i salute the person in question but would still recommend an Apple system, just because the OS looks better.i\u0027ve only worked on the Apple platform for a little over a year and a half now (having bought an Apple iBook first, and now opted for the powerbook G4 1.25ghz).","OS X is so superior to Windows that it\u0027s a joke.","Here comes the tricky part - the Power Setting for AMD process is rather wieird.Here is my recommandation for Power Setting* When you use your laptop with AC power, set it to \"Laptop/notebook\"* When you use your laptop without AC power set it to \"Desktop/office\" mode(find this from Power Option in Control Pannel in Windows)By doing this you can save battery life by minimizing CPU voltage use and FAN use.I tried other setting and it uses battery faster.","The premium that you pay is worth every cent and I won\u0027t make the mistake of going back to Windows or HP laptops.","BUt, personally, shame on anyone who ruins their Mac experience by relying on any Windows software on their system.","It hasn\u0027t locked up once, and I\u0027ve used it for hours with 5 programs running(excel, word, onenote, firefox, acrobat reader), several windows each, and it didn\u0027t even slow down a bit.","Windows users just have to get used to using control-click instead of right click and some differences in keyboard shortcuts.Expose.","Another feature I really enjoy is the ibooks\u0027 battery life, which clocks in at about 5 hours, almost double what competing Windows based notebooks have to offer.Technical specs: This could easily become a recap of what Apple\u0027s, Amazon\u0027s and every other site has, just technical specs.","The Mac OS is very intuitive.You can run windows on a Mac too and guess what it runs way better on the Mac then any of my PCs I have.","I cannot believe this answer, particularly given the fact that software and operating systems get upgraded all the time and that the machine has a label that says \"Designed for Microsoft Windows XP\" I upgraded to this Macbook Pro after using the 15\" powerbook for three years -- all I can say is that this machine is simply amazing.","They tout the instant on feature without booting Windows, but don\u0027t tell you that only channels 2-13 are available in that mode.\"1- I bought the same model and dont have any problems at all... but I can suggest while you are using tv feature, you should close all other background processes (personal ones of course).","After trying on three different computers (Mac \u0026 Windows), I had to hunt around for a customer support phone number (it\u0027s in the web site).","I am a long-time user of Apple products but have got to say that I am so happy with my recently purchased iBook (12\", 1.2GHZ, 256MB RAM - Upgraded to 768 - running Panther 10.3.8) that I cannot be thankful enough.I was a Windows user for many years - since 3.1 - and the comparison between even modern windows machines (I purchased a custom Dell laptop recently for a boss and had to set it up for him so I have a very good comparison point) still comes down to the blessing that Apple is the designer of the hardware and OS.","My logic was: don\u0027t do something if you think you might regret it down the road.First, my complaint(s): It works perfectly, I kind of miss reinstalling Windows XP and starting over every month.","Not really used to that on Windows.I\u0027ve used Vista for some time now, and believe me there will be pain, time, and money spent for most current Windows users to upgrade.","Windows 7 removes this limitation.My computer is 3 years old, but now runs very snappy - far better than it ever performed as a new machine.The fact that it is a duo processor helps as well.I also added a Toshiba usb bluetooth adapter for about $35 that gave the machine bluetooth capability.The biggest downer to this laptop is the graphics chip which is embedded into the motherboard.","The Windows Media Center is like having a TIVO without having to pay a monthly fee and the included remote control also controls your music, photos, DVD\u0027s, video\u0027s, TV and many other features.","I did shrink the Windows partition using Knoppix and installed Fedora Core 4.","Even the VAIO Power Management was disabled inside windows power management control panel.","The computer is very good this is my 7th or 8th Toshiba Laptop.The Windows Vista I am getting use to it, but promisse pretty good things.Try to transfer files from my old to my new, with the new features of the Vista, but the conection did not work.Do not know if the falt on the top right screen is due to softwares or the computer.","Does not come with the option of getting Windows XP Professional already installed.","The sound is very poor and it\u0027s not that fast.I had a Dell 8100 before also a compaq and a IBM and all of them where faster to open the windows and responding to commands.If I was going to by it now I will by something else.","However I like the fact that if needed you can add windows via bootcamp (if you want to play pc games or need to use apps that are not compatible with macs).","If I have any concern, it would be security....every Windows machine I\u0027ve owned has been vulnerable and subject to trash-out.","The AMD 64 bit 1.6Ghz TL-50 dual-cpu processor isn\u0027t really utilized all that well with the unoptimized Windows Vista or Windows XP Pro 32 bit operating systems - but Windows XP Pro (32 bit) works well enough and does recongnize the second CPU/processor and utilizes it for some things.Battery life is good (2 hrs +) but could be better, as could the keyboard - which while good, feels somewhat flimsy.","Unfortunately it also causes Windows to crash if I even switch it on.","And the beauty of it all is that you can now share files with almost any Windows file format doing away with old compatibility problems.","Mac\u0027s killer OS and Windows\u0027 programs.Pros:Multitasking is AMAZING ON THE MAC!!! I love it, Mac OS Lion is great in the ways of multitasking.It is extremely fast.The screen size is perfect.The Mac App Store is great.The keypad is backlit.Trackpad has amazing sensitivity.The battery life is good.Cons:It gets a bit hot on the bottom if it doesn\u0027t get proper ventilation.Glossy screen, but for me it isn\u0027t that bad.The fact that there is an App Store creates so many possibilities for the future of the Mac.","On the Windows machine I could press H-I-R and a row would go in, H-I-C and there was a column, H-D-R deletes the row etc.","I started with the Mini Mac, buying a Mac Book and an i Mac in a short period afterwards and I cannot get my kids off them now at home!All that kept me going with a Windows system was I needed an ultra-portable laptop given my travel by air a lot and the Sony Vaio I had was fine for this purpose.","TWO THUMBS AND BIG TOES UP,I WILL DEFINITLY SHOP HERE AGAIN, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. i would recomend this laptop because it has a good system plus it came with extra stuff so get it I would recommend this labtop to anyone..It is worth every sent.The hp imprint finish is really nice.Hp really takes pride in manufacturing their items..From first glance you are attracted to the beauty and layout of this labtop..its really a special edition as printed....It is really fast.programs install so fast that sometimes you don\u0027t even see the progress bars.The graphics is supberb.I run a lot of graphic and cpu intensive programs like audio editing,video editing,dj mixing.And amazingly I can run all those programs simultaneously without any drop in system performance.and still have an anti virus scanning.the new Intel centrino duo really lives up to its name.you can really do more....the mobile remote fits in the pcmia slot so you can never lose it.The ports at the side are very useful.like the hdmi.Webcam works great and the finger print reader works nice to......I don\u0027t know why one reviewer said that it doesn\u0027t have blue tooth but this one has it as advertised and it works great..And its just the perfect viewing size to at least watch movies and have a couple of windows opened up at the same time.I give this series a full 10 because I haven\u0027t found a single problem with it.","Oddly all the Windows laptops I found for $1000 were HUGE, ugly, and had very little memory.","My company is running Windows Vista on all non-design platforms, and you know what, its good, its REALLY good.","Iphoto is another good app. if you need to run windows apps u can purchase virtual pc. with this program u can run any amount of pcs on ur mac. isn\u0027t that kewl?!?! a mac and a pc on one system.","It was getting a bit on the aged side so I decided it was time to upgrade.Mac or Windows? Stupid question.","I\u0027ve even added VM Ware\u0027s Fusion program (running Windows XP) and, once loaded, it does the job as well.","Windows Vista is an ambiguous advantage.","The wireless internet works great if you get an airport card and airport base you can go anywhere (well at least wherever there is a wireless internet base (windows or mac) you can surf the internet and chat online.","I have found the transition from Windows XP to Mac OS X to be slow and frustrating.","The \"cling\", or \"click\", sounds don\u0027t occur often, but they are more frequent when using Windows Media Player.","It is not compatible with most software out there including software that was originally compatible with Windows XP.","I decided not to go with Windows for numerous reasons.","I\u0027m so tired of seeing the start menu on windows machine the icons and etc.","That computer has served us well, but like every other windows machine I\u0027ve ever used, it has major software problems.","I was a little wary of Windows XP but after using it for over a month I plan on upgrading my Desktop.","my son\u0027s Christmas ruined because of you Where is my COMPUTER I will not give you guys a good review until you give me my laptop!!!PRONTO!!! My system came with Windows Vista.Plus -This computer is SMALL (smallest I have worked with)Powerful, it keeps up great with the 1.3 processor4 USB ports (3 in the included base)Finger print scanner, I use this 40 times a day.","SIMPLER TO USE THAN WINDOWS.","Variety of uses.Activity monitor- the Apple version of the Windows Task Manager, although this can show you the current status of every hardware component of your computer, including current RAM usage and hard drive usage.Grapher- Wonderful tool for algebra students.","Recently, when my computer became infected, I merely used the backup sector (which takes away 20GB from your hard drive) to reload everything - it was a lot easier than manually reformatting, installing Windows, installing the thinkpad drivers, etc.","Especially with upcoming Windows Vista where you can adjust font size like a Mac, then you dont have to worry about the letters being too small(at least most of them wont be too small).","I thought it was a driver problem at first but I\u0027ve tried every windows based fix I could with no results.","The only annoying thing about the system is it has windows XP on it, which in my mind is a down grade from win2K.","Chose the AMD 64 for \" futureproofing \" also with Windows Longhorn out next year.","I have no problem playing 720p quicktime movies fullscreen.This is my first time using Windows Vista.","There are a few minor annoyances (Death of Rosetta, 4-finger swipe up now does the expose pick-a-window thing instead of showing the desktop, finder sidebar sort change and gray icons, and the inverted scroll behavior chief among them) going from 10.6 to 10.7\\10.8, but overall we\u0027re delighted with it.","Why Toshiba did not stick to XP instead of Windows Vista remains a mystery.","Numerous people have reported this and exchanged their Macbooks within the return window.","Only needs a Shift key on the right side to be complete.- Fingerprint reader is VERY helpful for logging in to Windows, web sites, email... no need to use keyboard then! :)- It is portable enough to have with you \"almost\" all of the time.- Solid state disk doesn\u0027t seem to slow down when it is \"getting full\", and no need to defrag (SHOULDN\u0027T defrag, since SSD has limited # writes).- The overall \"feel\" is very good - seems quite solid and robust, well built.- Hi-res screen makes icons/pictures look really sharp.Cons- Hi-res screen makes icons/text really small.","I went back to Windows 2000, because it was small and ran the best.","I am sick of Windows\u0027 unreliability, susceptibility to viruses and other problems, and the masking-tape-and-chewing-gum nature of patching together Windows machines just in order to make them function.","All in all, highly recommended for somebody who needs a high-powered laptop without wanting to pay a premium price for a new machine with the still-teething Windows Vista.EDIT: After nine months of using this laptop, there are several issues that have come up.","The strongest aspect of it to me pre-purchase was that I could install and run Windows XP on it, natively, via the included Boot Camp utility.","Going from windows to the apple system wasn\u0027t that bad, and my computer has never once crashed on me.","I used many windows laptops and they all feel cheap and the trackpad always sucks no matter how expensive the unit is.","It will show exactly what is happening in that window at the moment, meaning that if I were to have a video running on it, the video would play on the tiny window as I look for the window I want.","Wouldn\u0027t recommend to switch to Vista without at least 2 GB of RAM.Cons: It get\u0027s slow loading windows and all the programs that start when you log in, battery life not as good as my old Dell Inspiron 6000.","I was a Windows home user and now I\u0027m a very happy Mac user.","I used to dual boot Windows \u0026 Linux for years.","But now-a-days with all of the viruses and spyware that is plaguing the horrible \u0027Windows\u0027 operating system, I just don\u0027t understand why people still put of with Microsoft\u0027s crappy Windows OS.Anyways, the price might be a little more expensive than say a Dell or a Gateways but look at the reliabitlity of owning a Mac.","battery stinks- maybe 1 1/2 max-w/ power saver, screen down to no brightness and performance at lowest possible.tons of grippes on bottom-2 headset jacks-comes w/ a lot of junk-hd only 140gb even though they say 160gb-graphic card not so good-easy on/off switch for wirelessall around it is a wonderful laptop-would strongly suggest it Good luck if you want to do a clean install of windows after you buy this computer.","Even the sound is pretty good with just the computer\u0027s speakers.Main drawbacks: the manuals could be better, both in terms of explaining how to set and utilize the many features, but also in terms of interfacing the set up with the Windows Media Center 2005.","I got this Mac and what the hell I was living with Windows.","(Yes, it looks like a stained glass window.)","Design: Simple and smart (Kind of mixture of Dell and Sony) I bought this for my grandson even though it has a smaller screen and is twice as expensive as a windows machine.","So, when I just enabled this manager (and disabled windows wireless connection manager), everything runs smoothly.","Windows home is fine unless you are going to use this for a university or corporate network.","I have installed BootCamp and Windows XP on this crazy machine.","GarageBand I find particualrly impressive...I havent had any compatability issues.. even my Creative Zen MP3 Player could be linked to the iBook after a (free) program was downloaded.Having only ever used Windows before, I was a little worried that I wouldn\u0027t like OS X, but I\u0027ve discovered that I much prefer it.As for the trackpad... that thing amazes me...","I should know i have a powerhouse windows xp pro machine.","I had been a Windows user all my life, and little did I know what I was missing! The Mac OS runs flawlessly and intuitively, I have yet to have any problems with it.","Sadly, most of my pro audio and graphics software investment is Windows-based, not Mac-based.i found this page you\u0027re reading right now by searching Google for \"Sony VAIO VGN SZ shuts off spontaneously\" ... and i found the other reviews here stating the same things as i\u0027ve stated (granted i am more wordy). but look around and you will see...","This is very simple to do, just follow the on screen instructions when windows starts up.","It was great then but was I recently replaced it with a HP G7-1075 HP.***HP G7-1075DX Pavilion Laptop / AMD Phenom II Processor / 17.3\" LED HD Display / 4GB DDR3 Memory / 500GB Hard Drive / Multiformat DVDRW/CD-RW drive / Windows 7 Home Premium Edition operating system - Pewter I\u0027ve had this notebook computer for just under 2 years and in that time it has been nothing but problems.","As a long time Windows user, I\u0027ve gotten used to having Adaware, Spy Doctor, and Norton Anti-virus running in the background.","It blows away Windows 98 and the home versions of XP.","Nonetheless, I knew in a profound way that, in the comfort of my own home, there was no way I was going to be using a Dell running Windows.","Windows began crashing wihin the first week.","The laptop was cleaned perfectly, packed perfectly, and even came with a copy of Windows XP (Although I just installed Arch Linux.)","So yes, you are paying for aesthetic beauty but we do that in many items we purchase so why not with computers? As to their lack of product support, with the introduction of the Intel chip and their ability to run Windows, that won\u0027t really be an issue.Bottom Line: A great laptop computer with simplicity and style for around 1100.00 (with student discount through Apple) Like many others, I switched.","Sure you can get a laptop cheaper, but it will run windows...who want\u0027s that?

I strayed from the path for a number of years and suffered the Windows consequences.","The vast software choices and the low price made me think it would be OK to switch.Through the years, I struggled with windows operating systems, and with each new release of Windows, they copied more and more off the Macintosh operating system.","Windows Vista takes an incredible amount of time to boot, I clocked 4 minutes on a start-up.Baseline - If you are looking for a notebook for school/office work/home/multimedia you get a great deal here.","about the left click thing all you have to do is push ctrl along with the botton and it will left click!anyway i love it!

Mac OS X did take some time to get used to; coming from Windows XP and 7 was not as big a challenge as I expected it to be.","Not certain as to whether Windows Vista Premium is always slow, or this computer is just poorly configured.","Switching back to Windows would have been a struggle as much of the software is not available on Windows and if it is, the look and feel and functionality is a step down from Mac.","And, what about the very, very, very convenient Windows key on the keyboard?! Thinkpads still seem to think it\u0027s ok to skip those.","The Yahoo Messenger can\u0027t do as much as it can on Windows.. on the other hand.. it doesn\u0027t get hacked like the one on Windows, which doesn\u0027t freeze my computer, which makes my life a bit easier.If you\u0027re into video, you should remember two things.."],"aspect":"os","keyword":"windows"},{"responses":["That\u0027s great if you\u0027re into memory sticks but of little use to those who have cameras with CF slots or USB disk drives.All that being said, if you are someone who has a small home office, or a desk that you use for both writing and email.","Great specs for the price (got a great deal on a floor model at an office supplies store), especially the 512MB of RAM.","First - The Bad:-It clearly is used (a scratch here and there) but they disclose that to you before you purchase it so I was expecting that.-I almost thought that I wouldn\u0027t be getting my laptop because it took so long to arrive - much more time than the quoted estimated time - several weeks longer.-It didn\u0027t come with a Windows restore disk.-The program disk it came with only had installers for some of the programs that came loaded on the computer and the disk was not professionally labeled (it could easily get mixed up with something else if not careful).-The battery in the one I got is nearly shot - it gives less than an hour of usage - perhaps even less than 45 minutes but replacements on Amazon are pretty cheap.The Good:-The computer, so far, works as good as a new one in my opinion.-Though MS Office isn\u0027t loaded they were considerate enough to install OpenOffice to ensure that you can do the most basic task of computing (writing).-Though it\u0027s not on the installer disk, Avira antivirus software was installed upon arrival.If you\u0027re willing to risk a delay in delivery and are savvy enough to get your software up to par on your own then I would recommend this product to you.","No, it doesn\u0027t works with Windows Mobile nor Symbian... but anyway it\u0027s not the product\u0027s fault... it\u0027s just because it\u0027s so small which is it\u0027s main advantage.My final comments:- With the Dock, you can have a complete computer in your hands when on the road and a desktop PC when you\u0027re in home or office, even both.","And if you decide to buy it, buy it at Amazon, because you\u0027ll save over $150 in taxes (most states), which can go towards the XP Pro upgrade, anyhow.Oh yeah, and I\u0027d give this a 4.5 star--not a 4.0--only because I did want the XP Pro edition, pre-loaded, and maybe additional free (READ: Useful) softwares, such as Microsoft Office.","However, if you want a top quality office suite, I would recommend you purchase Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac.Back to the hardware, the video out on the iBook is the only thing somewhat less than satisfactory in my opinion.","I have installed mic office instead of open office, but I have no regrets, as I did not pay for it.","It did not contain Microsoft Office and had to be taken to an Apple service center to be repaired.","This \"white\" model is a quick update by Apple on the old Core Duo MacBook portable computer that was only introduced six months ago.Besides the Intel Core 2 Duo processor update on this model MacBook, my \"Pro\" features are:* a larger hard drive (from 60 to 80GB Serial ATA Drive),* more RAM (1GB for this model, which I\u0027ve bumped up to the maximum 2 GB),* a whopping double-layer SuperDrive DVD burner which can give up to 8GB of DVD+R disc storage capabilities,* a fantastic bright 13.3 inch glossy screen delivered at 1280x800 pixels,* a longer-range built-in AirPort Extreme WiFi (be careful if you use WiFi, it will pull in all the neighborhood/office WiFi nets, so if you use AirPort, get set up and password-encrypted quickly before you add your close-hold data to your hard drive),* a better Bluetooth 2.0+EDR wireless capability for peripherals,* an \"iSight\" camera lens integrated into the case above the screen, using the Photo Booth software to instantly begin taking sharp pictures around your keyboard environment,* analog \u0026 optical/digital audio input/outputs,* a mini-DVI port (requiring low cost adapters sold by Apple) that can display on external monitors,* the Tiger Operating System is arguably the world\u0027s best with ITunes, iMovie, iDVD, GarageBand, and IPhoto, and the Widgets sitting on the translucent DashBoard are amazing,* the case opening and closing mechanism is the best ever,* and, the fabulous Mag-Safe power connector that protects against accidental trips on the powercord.","I have been using this for all my office needs, spreadsheets, word documents, presentations, etc.","Well if you are just working mainly at home or office with a desk big enough to accommodate all these stuffs, it won\u0027t be a problem of course.","I work in the same office space with the coleague that I sold my K23 and we don\u0027t hear the fan at all.","I use office, and all of the I apps(except for iMovie) and they all run beautifully! I do strongly suggest spending the extra buck and getting at least 256 megs of ram, it makes a big difference.","It works GREAT!!!!!!! After doing some surfing, viewing a dvd, working on a Office document or editing some family photos, the laptop stays almost as cool as if I just started it! I certainly recomend buying both at once, specialy if you will use it on your lap and even if you are using it on a desk as I am.I would also recomend getting 256MB more of RAM, you can never have too much and it will probably make the laptop faster and cooler.Part II (16th July 2005)Six-seven months now, and I certainly love this toy.","Also, Notebook is not great for installed software for e.g it comes with XP Home and Trial versions of Office etc.","But I dont like Toshiba installs too many trial-version software i.e. antivirus, office etc.","When I go into an office and everyone has those boring black laptops they look at me and get jealous when I pull out the SZ VAIO.","I\u0027ll probably end up buying the new version because I use Excel a lot and I\u0027m just praying its better than Office 2004 which is awful- same caution with other older software that you might have from the PPC days, its runs but seems really rough around the edges compared to native apps, you\u0027re probably going to want to buy new software- you need to buy a separate video adapter to hook this up to a projector or LCD screenOverall a good but pricey laptop with some compromises depending on what you need to do with it.","Second, my iTunes audio skips freqently and my MS Office programs are prone to take 10-15 second naps when I\u0027m editing.","It is more than capable when it comes to standard office programs, but the only limitation I have found is in gameplay.","I am running Microsoft Office X for OS X, which I bought for my old PowerBook and all of its programs thbat I use, Word, Excell, and Entourage, seem to run at least as fast on the new computer as they did on the old one.I decided to buy the 2.4Ghz model because it was on closeout, plus Amazon offered a $150 check to those who bought one.","I have seen and tried all the other laptops around the office, and this one is still head and shoulders above other Wintel newer ones.My current 17\" PB also went off my motorbike with me in an accident a few years ago.","The wireless is handy too.After adding Microsoft Office 2003 it makes a great packagefor a complete system.","I was also able to duplicate the problem on the one on display at Office Depot.","Among many options I choose this one for many reasons:- Great price- Great desing and look- No MS Windows in it (so I will less vulnerable to viruses)- Excelente application availability (MS Office, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Flash, DVD Authoring, DVD Burning, MSN Messenger, eMail, etc, etc, etc).- Rock solid platform (*nix based).- Good device support (From OSX or *nix)- iSight camera is awesome- Battery performance (up to 4 hours doing stuff like browsing the web, email and chat at the same time).- Huge touchpad- Superb backlit keyboard (nice feeling too)I have read many complaints about this laptop being too hot to use, but as far I can say, I haven\u0027t noticed excessive heat coming up from it.There\u0027s only one minor flaw that could be fixed at newegg for $45: You need 1024Mb RAM to unleash the full power of the CPU, if not, opening Rosetta translated apps will take more time, but after that, the app will work fine.Wireless conectivity is a snap, more friendly than Windows.It took me like 4 days to get used to the new OS, but now I\u0027m like a fish in the water.In short, if you are looking for a laptop that could replace your desktop, or you need power mobility and don\u0027t need to run any particular application that\u0027s availiable to Windows only, then this could be the one that\u0027s for you, as it was for me.","Computer came pre-loaded with trial version of Office 2007.","So what do I do now with the 4 USB port\u0027s...?!And all my new documents I need to transfer to my Laptop...?!Any suggestions...?! I got this A13585-s4527 from Office Depot and added 2 gig memory and removed Vista and installed XP Professional.","It\u0027s for someone who already has Mac tech somewhere else in their life and want a pricey, portable addition to that tech.If you\u0027re using this at home and the office, you\u0027ll need at least one Airport Extreme to get your WiFi going.","As to using in an office - where I used all of my Macs until recently - it works perfectly on a windows based network and with MS Office other people hardly ever even know you use a Mac.","I bought a 215 series laptop from Office Depot a week ago and got the Black Screen of Death an hour into using it.","For normal application use, such as office programs, the internet, DVD movies, and even photo editing software, this ran perfectly.","I was worried about the screen being too small but the size and form factor are perfect for my home and office uses.","Again, if you\u0027re using this for an Office/Classroom PC, that\u0027s not an issue.One thing I love about Averatec\u0027s PC is the three USB ports on the front side on the right.","Sure, it\u0027s got a fast processor, but my old versions of Adobe Creative Suite crawl because they\u0027re not optimized, and Microsoft Office is just a slug.","If you use Outlook (not Express) heavily, or use Powerpoint, Excel, and Word a lot and like XP, then the Mac is a snoozer.reasons not to buy:1-you pay a lot to get it to do the things a PC with updated Microsoft Office Professional Suite already does, and it never is quite as good...Mac Powerpoint feels pokier (saving, just in keeping up with my typing), Mac Excel toolbar gets on top of/in the way of my worksheets (haven\u0027t figured out how to make it go to the back), Outlook just isn\u0027t replicated at all on the Mac (unless you get Virtual PC)...Entourage just lacks the functionality2-doesn\u0027t seem to handle the WEP password protocol on my Linksys wireless home network...even the folks at the Apple store said I wouldn\u0027t be able to get the DHCP security to work with my PC-based home network3-Filevault....oooh, what a liability.","Then for those Microsoft people out there, you can put Microsoft Office on your Mac.","But don\u0027t be fooled with the Microsoft Office that seems to be included, Microsoft wouldn\u0027t forgoe a profit that easily.","Excelente desempe\u0026ntilde;o, se apaga con una rapidez inusual, la interface gr\u0026aacute;fica es muy buena, el teclado es grande a pesar de lo peque\u0026ntilde;a que es la maquina, y muy potente para conectarse a internet, compra recomendada Excelent notebook, very less of weight, practical for carry anywhere in the office and home.","I was traveling on a business trip and it automatically found a hub in another office building so I started surfing the net on their connection.","I wanted the ability to access wireless hotspots while traveling, and/or around my home and office.","I bought this laptop at a local Office Max or one of those places last year.","The Iphoto App is wonderful and easy, installing Office was so simple I could not believe it and a few other pieces of software.","I live in NYC.Anyway, I went to the post office to mail it off.","Miss some of your PC stuff? Office for MAC runs seamlessly back and forth to and from PC\u0027s with your documents and if you must, Parallels Desktop lets you run a piece of the HUGE hard drive in Windows.","This deficiency slows and spoils the performance of an otherwise very good machine Net/net:1) GREAT! for web surfing, managing/editing multi-media (especially stills/videos of the kids), and MS-office apps2) Good to okay for gamers (Half-life does well, but Doom 3 and Everquest 2 can get bogged down)3) This is my 9th machine for home use (9 desktops; 2 laptops) and my 2nd Sony.","Given my experience with the machine so far, however, I am unconcerned and confident they will work flawlessly if called upon.I am running XP Home as installed on delivery, along with Office 2003--no issues with either.","If you run processor hungry apps this is the notebook for you.Multiple office software can be run on this set up without any lag, it\u0027s perfect for those who care more about the \"guts\" of the system rather than what\u0027s \"in\".I\u0027ve found some reviewers who say this system runs hot.","Freebies are Comic Life, iLife (iMovie, iTunes, iDVD, iWeb, Garageband), and Omni Outliner.It took me roughly 2 hours to completely configure the new laptop the way I wanted it (most of the time taken up by installing Parallels (with Windows XP taking 45 minutes), Final Cut Studio, XCode, Office, Aperture, Freeway, and iWork).","I bot this at Office max, in santa rosa n california.","I hope that the amazon corporate office see this scam and take consideration.I am NOT HAPPY!!! I rate this laptop highly in all areas except the DVD-RW drive has never worked.","The laptop overheats and destroys the motherboard.DO NOT BUY HP! They have refused to acknowledge its design defect and have refused to help any of the costumers who have wasted upwards of $1200.00 USD from purchasers! In fact, I have written to the CEO\u0027s office twice and to no avail, they have refused to help me.","If you walk by my office it sounds like I have a floor fan running in there.","With Windows XP, in lieu of Vista, only 16 of the 60 GB hard drive is used...and that includes the full suite of Microsoft Office 2003 and several other larger programs.","The USPS website indicated they delivered to Averatec offices in Fremont, California on February 10th, Year of Our Lord 2004, at 1:22 p.m.Initially, I could not track the RMA on screen.","The worst of these is MS Office.","It would also not play movies from your hard drive- No AccuPoint (or similar) device, only touchpad.- Touchpad\u0027s scroll area sometimes would let-the-scroll-loose- Very little functionality could be added to the touchpad (I would like to see tapping on the corner open some program or maximize the window)Overall, it seems to be a great notebook (I will use it for Office programs, some strategic games, movie watching, etc) for my purpose, and will update the info if something else comes up.","Can\u0027t expect blazing fast processing and speed as this is running on a low voltage processor.Overall a pretty good second machine for web, simple games and office applications.","just wish it was a bit more powerful otherwise so far so good, only had it for a day.edited below at 7/17/2007:OK now I have had it for couple weeks and I have to say they do a great job, I was sceptical at first but now I\u0027m sold, these things are great, and the power is fine, I have not figured out how to change the stars but I like to change my review to a 5 star keyboard is full size.lightweightfull glass screenuser friendlygreat memoryI would recommend buying the Microsoft Office upgrade though.Other than that...you can\u0027t go wrong with this laptop.","I\u0027ve had this box since new, when I bought it as a demo model from Office Depot.","Even your friends with powerbooks will do a doubletake.The ONLY reason I gave the laptop 4 stars is because this thing weighs almost 10 pounds! Get a good case and don\u0027t drop it! I purchased a Toshiba M45-S331 on Feb. 2 at Office Depot for $1299.99 after rebates.","I had MS Office bought 2yrs back that I wanted to use instead of purchasing a new Vista version.So this laptop serves my purpose of a home user who doesnt need Vista and lot of RAM.","Now that I have installed Microsoft Office Home \u0026 Student I believe this will be a great computer for me to use in the fall for college.","FORTUNATELY, I have seen that Apple software (Office, Adobe, Macromedia, etc) are made in VERY small files (Office 2004 is only around 250Mb big), so you will have PLENTY of space (30 - 35 Gb) free when you have done installing quite a lot of programs.Games, on the other hand, do take a lot of space.RAM MEMORYI heard that 512Mb were enough, but several people got me convinced on getting an additional 512 which cost $170 USD here in Mexico.","I recommend iWork as it\u0027s a great productivity SW, and you can convert to Window\u0027s Office formats if needed.","Its 256MB of RAM, the absolutely minimum for Windows XP, also means it won\u0027t run Microsoft Office well, but is adequate for Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, Windows Media Player, etc.; just make sure you don\u0027t run too many applications at the same time, or the machine will feel very sluggish.As others have pointed out, you should adjust the power option in Control Panel and also download an updated driver to get the maximum performance out of the AMD CPU.","I might sit at the dining room table, on the couch, on the living room floor, in the office, or in my bedroom.I do recommend you add some memory to the iBook, which can add yourself.","Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta.","Transfer files from Microsoft Office to your other pcs.","It\u0027s small for office work.","Left my favorite Sennheiser microphone at the office (*Duh*), so I had to use my old Andrea stand-by \u0027mike,\u0027 but....Dragon literally flies on MacBook Pro.","If it was any smaller I would have a hard time holding it, and any bigger and you lose some of the portability of it.Software:I\u0027m running Windows Professional, Open Office, use IE7, Trillian for IM, xfire for gaming IM.","Perhaps not a good power user\u0027s desktop replacement, but definitely sufficient IMHO for normal usage that includes office applications, e-Mail and Internet.","I did purchase MS Office 2008 for Mac and am also pleased with it\u0027s applications.","Despite the fact that it comes with Windows XP loaded on it, it does not include rights to use Microsoft Office 2003 for more than 60 days.","I tend to run the Microsoft Office suite, Safari, iTunes, iPhoto, watch movies, and use the internet.","Not a problem at home or in the office.","It makes a good PC for Office, Library, Class, Home, etc work.","Also, don\u0027t forget, there are some AWESOME alternatives to MS Office on the \u0027net for FREE - yes, FREE.Apple\u0027s new iWork setup is perfect for a home or small business user.","So far, I have had the system board replaced twice, and as I write, it sits at Toshiba\u0027s corporate office for \"evaluation\".","Otherwise, my problems are with freezes on programs such as safari, and firefox, and slow Office suite.","Still recommend it for the Office-user and non-gamer.","For school you should get the Windows office for Mac programs, since that has all the programs like Word that you will need to share reports and stuff.","Working with the MacBook Pro was always good, with all applications being very responsive (except, of course MS Office, as my version is not Universal.","Next, I wrote a letter to the CEO and finally received a call back from Gateway executive offices.","Office 2007 does come pre-installed but it is a 30-day trial only.I have noticed people complaining about the heat and battery life.","Adding software such as MS Office was fast and trouble free.","I\u0027d previously had a Mac in college and had been using a PC because of work for the past seven years and I\u0027m no beginner user - fluent in just about every type of software out there from Office applications to video/audio programs.","LA COMPRE CON DUDAS PERO EN VERDAD SUPERO MIS ESPECTATIVAS, FUNCIONA PERFECTAMENTE SEGUN SU CAPACIDAD, VINO CON WINDOWS Xp Y OFFICE LISTA PARA USAR.","First I had to buy a DVD drive to install Office 2003.","Windows Vista takes some getting used to, but has great features (and I absolutely love Office 2007).Back to the computer- Overall, this laptop is great though.","This shows in the magnificent performance both in office applications and 3D gaming.Lastly, Windows XP :) The soothsayers say \u0026quot;go for Pro, not home\u0026quot; and I can see why.","HP is poor quality and support that at best is contemptuous of the customer My husband and I got my mother and his mother a mailbug this past Christmas and they just love them! They have saved themselves a fortune in long distant phone calls and no stamps to run to the post office for.","Of course, I can just re-latch it again, but it would be nice if the latch held a little better.Overall, the R25 seems like a great `bang for the buck,\u0027 and I\u0027m looking forward to using it for years to come! I got my V2405US at a \u0027blow out\u0027 sale at an office supply store - about $500, and it was new, in box, and no rebate funny business.","I have Microsoft Office which is not a universal binary, but Rosetta (which allows non-universal apps to run) does a pretty good job.","I have upgraded the Ram to 2GB and installed Virtual PC, which I hardly use and MS Office as well as iLife \u002705 and Toast 6 Titanium.","That\u0027s enough for Office, a few games, and an iTunes collection, but consider this: if you got a 20 GB iPod and filled it up from your iBook, about two thirds of your iBook\u0027s storage would be nothing but music! If you think you\u0027ll need anything more in the future, seriously consider the 14\" iBook (with 60 GB standard) or custom-ordering a 12\" iBook from Apple\u0027s own online store.One last thing: I\u0027d like to comment on D. Potts\u0027 review.","Actually with the new native Office 2008 and Creative Suite 3 I focus on my work instead of evaluating the behavior of the apps.The whole experience of a mac is unique, no waiting at start-up, no dealing with viruses, adware, malware or spyware.","I have taken to displaying PDFs and Office documents at 125-150% to compensate.","by the time you load up the laptop, power supply (huge by its own right), accessories in your laptop carrying case, well hold on cause this thing gets heavy on a long trek, long like from your office to your car.Compared to other laptops this one does not cook your legs as it operates so it runs relatively cool even under the most demanding games like supreme commander.HD dvd is nice but the battery life does not hold long enough to complete a full movie.This unit comes with the TV tuner feature.","I bought this with the idea of using on a train and working in a word processing document(my commute is 1.5 hrs. door to door) and my first day I was very annoyed with this...I couldn\u0027t do anything but listen to music! I fortunately had access to an old version of Office \u002797 so I didn\u0027t have to pay hundreds of additional dollars for programs that I assumed would have been already installed.","I was going to give it 4 stars, but I\u0027ll go with the 5 stars because it has every necessary MS office program built in already as a 60 day free trial.","Don\u0027t even bother to ask to install win2000 you are so used to and know already, it\u0027s impossible, the needed drivers are not available.The best is that it doesn\u0027t come with a recovery CD, if you want it you have to purchase it from sony at 25$ Great kids computer esp kids in elementary school it cannot be upgraded to Leopard but it can run tons of kids educational software Microsoft Office 04 and be used to get on the internet.","The one program I did need was MS Office 2008 and the installation using my iMac\u0027s drive was flawless and straightforward.As many around the \u0027net have stated I can\u0027t imagine this being anyone\u0027s primary computer but as a travel companion and for web-surfing, e-mail and documents Mac fans need not hesitate.I haven\u0027t used any processor intensive programs such as Photoshop or VMWare but I don\u0027t have to: that\u0027s why I have my iMac.","Recommended!

I installed Vista (by reformatting the drive and installing from scratch), Microsoft Office 2003, and AVG, Firefox, CS2, et. al.","I think, the Office who repaired it added my RAM up to 1 GB for free.","Surprisingly, Microsoft Office is pretty stable - it is not yet universal, but I would say that it is far more stable than say, Safari.Overall, I really love my mac and I would not trade it for any other computer out there!!! I really love this laptop.","Does include OS but no Office.","It is great in the diffuse light found in most offices and homes (much better than standard LCDs).","And, even Office outlook 2003 works so slow with my old HDD.","It was not until I searched through the Gateway voicemail system that I got a real person who physically delivered the message to my contact for me.After speaking again with Gateway executive offices, I received the same conclusion - no return and I would need to send it back to the company.","The 256mb it comes with will probably due if you only intend to use MS Office and other similar applications, but if you\u0027re like me and burn CDs regularly with it an upgrade to 512mb would do you a lot of justice.The video card can also be an issue if you plan on serious gaming with this laptop.","Later in the day turned it on and it sign into the network automatically.- The 4 in 1 integrated card reader is very convenient to transfer files between this and other computers.- Another great feature, specially because you don\u0027t get it for 750 is a 15.4 widescreen.- 4 USB ports, 1 Fire Wire, 1 Video S and a monitor Port- The software included is brand name and well known, including Mc Afee Spyware (30 day trial), Norton Internet Security (90 Day Trial) Nero Express 6.0, Power DVD, Office Trial in case you don\u0027t want to buy it you can settle for Works 8, which seem more complete than the previous version.- Lots of memory a 60, yes you\u0027re reading correctly 60 GB Hard Drive, not a lot by today standards, but most notebooks in its price range have only 40 GB.-Dual Layer multi format DVD+/-RW with up to 8X DVD +/-RI\u0027m really pleased with this purchase, and forgot to mention it looks stylish.","It\u0027s a Mac, what else would you expect? I hardly turn on the tower in the office.","In other words, I\u0027m on overload for tools to get my work done; I originally bought Office \u002707 Ultimate to go w/ my PC but my g/f is an educator and gets Office \u002708 at a huge discount, so we went w/ that.I\u0027ve had ZERO issues adapting to the Mac OS.","Many people would be better served spending the $79 on this package than the $300-400 for MS Office because Pages is simple to use and has great templates - and it can save easily to PDF or DOC or other formats to share with Windows.","I do audio recording with mine, and I\u0027ve put it through a lot, and it\u0027s held up remarkably well.Appleworks can do a number of things better than Microsoft Word, in my opinion (and yes, I\u0027ve done a lot of programming / tech support for the microsoft office suite).Sorry the previous guy had a bad experience, but considering I\u0027ve spent about 1 hour doing troubleshooting on my iBook over 2 years, I think this makes it worth it.","I plug it in while waiting for a flight, but I still have to carry my i-River MP3 player for any flight over two hours.Although I bought this for business, I also like to have it while watching a baseball game on TV or just being away from the office but within network range.","I bought it with Vista and loaded nothing on but MS Office.","I can now run Office 2003, Money 2008, the full version of Firefox, IE 7, and I just installed TaxACT 2007 (low-cost tax prep software).","The FXA47 is a sleek machine and when it works, it is wonderful.I run a number of machines with XP and all perform better than this laptop, especially my Dell laptop.The FXA47 hangs repeatedly when using standard programs such as the microsoft office family.","Which is a bummer if that happens to include programs like Photoshop, Office and an expensive scanner, as well as an MP3 player.Having said that, should you buy this ibook? Or a Mac for that matter? Well yeah, but only if you can afford it.","I assumed I had a bad laptop, so I returned it to Office Depot on Feb 3.","I was worried at first but Lenovo has carried the Thinkpad torch superbly into the production of the T60 model.PROS:-Build quality is second to none.-Integrates MS Office Applications easily into hardware.-Super long battery life and high performance options.-Great tactile keyboard and you can buy a keyboard in various languages and type fonts.-All the parts are easily user removable, user replaceable, and user serviceable!-Great customer support at Lenovo!-Unique features like waterproof keyboard, airbag, roll cage, fingerprint security, Thinkpad manager, etc...-SXGA and UXGA resolution screens!-Quiet dust proof fan.CONS:- No SD or Memory Card slots but you can easily buy a PC adapter card.- Runs hot on surfaces like beds and cushions and fan is not super quiet when laptop is hot.- Video Memory options are scant on the T60 models.","I also just wanted to try a new operating system (Not that I particularly dislike Windows, but I find it kind of boring and it makes me feel like I\u0027m doing tedious office work.).I\u0027m not sure if I need to talk about the iBook\u0027s design, it\u0027s obviously the best looking notebook out there (besides the Powerbook).","For my drive to work (10 minutes) I put it in \"stand by\", when I arrive my office I plug it into my cat5, wake it back up and continue without waiting for reboots etc.","I asked if they saw any signs of water damage and they stated they had not.I am in the processes of recommending replacement laptops for my office and purchasing several as gifts and due to this experience I am through with HP.","So a quick rundown:Pros:-Glossy shell and glossy screen make for beautiful laptop inside and out-Powerfull new processor-cool features such as webcam, dvd writable drive, magnetic latch and power cord, spaced out keys for my big hands-reasonably priced for what you get-long battery life compared to previous laptops I\u0027ve owned-Supports a wide range of software including Microsoft Office and Windows.","MS Office is a must if you\u0027re a college student otherwise everything you need is pretty much pre-loaded in the box.overall...if i didn\u0027t get this upgrade for free i wouldn\u0027t be quite as happy as i am now.","This is MUCH better than Averatec\u0027s 17 inch, where the glidepad\u0027s position is wrong.In addition to the expected XP Pro, it comes with a six-month trial version of MS Office 2003, student \u0026 teacher edition, and all its elements.","I have several animation programs, as well as several office and publishing programs on mine.","I use the benchmark portion that is in a utility program called batteryeater to give you a reference between the two.First off, as many people will tell you, the 256MB RAM (224MB because the video takes a minimum of 32MB and can be set up to 64MB) isn\u0027t enough, the laptop has two slots for RAM (1 is already occupied by the 256MB PC2100), so it would be a good investment to purchase another 256MB stick (~$30) or a 512MB (~$50) if you plan to do more than office work.","This is beyond ridiculous, particularly in light of the fact that Microsoft is debuting a new OS next year.I did not bother to check the price of a full license of Microsoft Office 2003 but the fact that you will need to make this additional purchase is something to be considered when making the decision to buy this laptop.","(We use both in our office and as the owner of the company I\u0027m the default IT guy.)We could have bought equivalent processing speed and features about 20% cheaper with Windows, but I would be the one who had to maintain the things so we went with these MacBooks.One of the best decisions I\u0027ve made this year.They worked great out of the box for what the girls wanted to do.","Can\u0027t complain about the machine, it\u0027s faster than my old laptop I paid $2k for and it\u0027s a lot lighter.I\u0027ve been buying a lot of Dells for the office and decided to look elsewhere after a few factory defects.","This a DESKTOP REPLACEMENT, no doubt!For the features, is NOT so heavy...with the added port replicator is a monster laptop, sound is exceptional thru the 12\" speaker included in the packet.The screen is out of the mind...extremely brilliant and nitid..even better than my office Vaio K23, its 17 inches surpasses all expectations... the bundle softwares is ok, even would be better if would bring some more burning applicationsPROS: Superbrilliant screen, convenient size, 1 gb Ram and 64 mb ATI video card 9600, quick response, 100 Gb HD, not so heavy, nice port replicator, burn Double Layer DVD, wireless work extremely smooth....CONS: Port replicator easily detached in a non-totally horizontal surface (lap, etc), my XP crashed two times with Gigapocket appl. (for TV captures)...no big dealAfter buying this machine I noticed the Toshiba 17\" COSMIO with 100 GB HD, 512 RAm and the TV/Video card inside, no need of port replicator, A comparison would be interesting to find.I wonder why the Vaio A series did not come with all in there as the GRT models did.Anyway this in an excellent laptop for home.","The PC was supposed to come with a 60 trial key for MS office - but it didn\u0027t.","I was nervous about buying a new computer with Windows Vista, but, this computer is sweet! It is fast and has improved my ability to communicate with my office significantly.","The laptop is great for office and statistical applications as well as Internet.","For example, if someone on my iChat buddy list is online, a green dot will appear next to a message from him or her in my Mail inbox.I also use Microsoft Office, Quicken, Dreamweaver MX, and Palm Desktop - they all work well on the Mac.","Never have to deal with any of that craziness like spyware that many novice windows users believe is \u0027normal\u0027 for using a computer.I converted a company that had 10 PC\u0027s and 2 Mac\u0027s to become an 11 Mac and 2 PC office.","I\u0027m a long-time Mac user and an officer in a Macintosh Users Group.","I you want to use Windows, you will need to purchase a new Windows XP SP2 single disk version; If you want Office tools, likewise, though many use the Mac version of Word and Excel.What is hard to get used to? No \u0027delete\u0027 key (Mac has a \u0027delete\u0027 key, but it functions as a backspace) When you are in the Windows environment, you have to use mouse \u0027click\u0027 functions to delete things.","no matter what, however, the Office 2003 trial installation wouldn\u0027t start.","5 stars for the computer itself and 10 (if that were possible) to Amazon! This computer is perfect for anyone who needs a laptop for office applications and the internet.","i have office 2004 also.","It lets me telecommute from my toasty bedroom instead of from my cold, converted-porch office with a desktop.","Don\u0027t expect some awesome machine though; it\u0027s a dinosaur!PS - Double check what you\u0027re getting! If it says no HD you need to get one (I bought a small flat usb drive and put Linux on it, works great) Does it come with a charger? (I have the cheap chinese charger on here and it works fine) Are there any other problems with it?Goodluck Pros : Light (3 pounds), small, beautiful screen, great wi-fi, sturdy, good battery life, dvd burner, great dvd playback, widescreen, fast for Office MS, IE, Itunes, even games such as Rise of Nations and Age of Empires, great looks, dvd and volume controls, nice all around design, attention to detail, 2 USB 2.0 and 1 Firewire, video out.","Even purchased software life Microsoft Office will do unexpected things on occasion.","you could also improve the remote control, it doesnt work for too much programs, only the volume butons.....i would also like to say that or you forgot to install a certificated microsoft office, or you always send it with a temporal one.","You get everything you could possibly want in the way of connections and options - double USB, Firewire, PS/2, built-in modem and NIC, docking option, and with the two optical drives plus the drive bay battery you\u0027re really set to configure yourself for anything.This is *not* a Vaio killer - it has the heft of an old fashion laptop, but with that comes a sense that it\u0027ll last through a few hundred flights and being thrown around the office.","I bought this computer for travelling, since I use a desktop in my office and home.","There\u0027s no MS Office here, and XP Home is your OS.","( mfctr sggst\u0027d retail was $1599 )Been very happy with this laptop.Have used for surfing the web, email, pix editing, Excel, Word, monitoring remote-surveillance video, remote data back-ups from office, and on-line poker ( multi-tables).Have even hooked up to 42\" HDTV (LCD) via VGA output to show slide-shows, DVD\u0027s and interesting web-sites.Have lugged the 10 lb\u0027er on road-trips a few times.","After years of lugging big laptops around, this Sony is a joy to tote around!It is more than adequate for what I use it for: basic office applications (the OpenOffice equivalents of Word, Excel, PowerPoint); I demo web applications using Xitami, PHP, Python, and MySQL; I watch DVDs \u0026 listen to MP3s, and sync w/ my iPod using the builtin FireWire.","The screen is sharp and impressive, the battery life is good (not quite the 6 hours advertised, but a solid 4-4.5 hours), its incredibly portable, the full-size keyboard is easy to use, and I\u0027ve easily integrated the iBook at home for the full desktop experience with a regular monitor, wireless mouse, and external drive (to make up for the small hard drive).Having to buy Microsoft Office was definitely a negative of the iBook, but it was definitely worth the extra cost.","I bought mine from Amazon and it was delivered in less than 2 days with standard shipping! This is perfect for office/student use, NOT for the hard-core gamer.","It does everything I need it to do including Microsoft Office programs, browsing, research, etc.","There\u0027s natural light in my office, which of course changes throughout the day, and I\u0027m forever fiddling with the angle of the screen so that I can see my work instead of myself.","I am a fairly tech savy person and I think windows Vista and Office 2007 are a waste of money and since this laptop can only use Vista it too is a waste.","i tried to install my old Office 2003 Professional.","\"Try AOL, High-Speed Services, Easy Internet Services, Microsoft Office (preinstalled, but you need to pay to use it.), Vonage, Vongo, Rhapsody, Ebay, muvee autoProducer and Online Services (Earthlink, Juno, MSN, Netzero, AOL, Vonage, Vonage Small Business).- Programs running in the taskbar.","i couldn\u0027t uninstall it either, thinking that would free up the Office Professional installation.finally, i went back to the VAIO Recovery software and selected re-setting the C: drive to \"factory settings.\"","Get Microsoft office teacher student edition.","It does not even compare with the HP Xbrite, Toshiba Trubrite, and Gateway Ultrabrite.The negative aspects are the standard battery that comes with the machine that only lasts about 2 hours and the weak graphic card and integrated speakers (but, if you use earphones you get a better experience).The best reason I like this computer personally is because I got a great deal at Office Depot for less than $699 on a weekly special.","Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, and even Windows Media Player.","I will be upgrading the memory by adding a 512mb chip shortly, which will make the speed of this thing increase that much more.As far as compatability, if you qualify for it, get the academic version of Office for Mac (just released 2004 version) for less than $150.00, and you\u0027ll have all the MS office programs you need, which create files completely compatible with the Windows versions.When work is done, however, the iLife programs (which has photo management, movie editing, the iTunes music jukebox (and iTunes store), DVD creation, and music creation programs) are a joy to use--your creative side really comes out, and the end products are very polished.In summary, you can\u0027t go wrong.","That said, I\u0027ve had no viewability issues in widely varied lighting conditions of my office (which is pretty bright, with overhead lighting and lots of exterior light) and my house (which is largely the opposite).- The system runs well (or so it seems) with 2 GB, but I am upgrading to 4 GB (the sticks are on their way - but not from Apple - way overpriced).- the 17\" and higher-end 15\" get 256 MB of video ram, 128 MB in the lower-end 15\" model - most folks are probably fine with 128 MB as it is the change in the graphics processor here that is truly the big news in performance.","iWorks is 2GB NB MS office is only 561 MB.","I\u0027ve been using this laptop for over a month already and the only thing I can say is that it is a great computer with all you can need for an intermediate demmanding user ( not advanced for the lack of a great graphic support ),but other than that is amazing for a daily personal or office work.","It\u0027s been very stable in six months of all-day use with MS Office, Oracle (Java runtime environment for Windows) apps, SSH and other network/VPN clients, Altiris apps, Symantec AV, and a wide variety of applications running on Windows XP Pro.","Web, email, Office 2003, the occasional picture work.","With open office out there, much of the windows office suite is becoming obselete.","Simply put, this PowerBook has re-inventing computers for me.As a lawyer and a soldier I primarily use MS Office.","I did have to add Office Mac, but the Apple offers far superior graphics and publishing abilities.","I also called Apple once (when trying to secure my home wireless network) and got a charming service rep from Canada who gave my lots of tips.By the way, I ended up buying Microsoft\u0027s Office for Mac (work, excel, powerpoint \u0026 entourage) and have been happy.All in all, this was one of the best decisions I\u0027ve made in a long time! I\u0027ve used macs and pcs for the past 10 years and owned both windows and macos machines.","I find the 512mb DDR memory more than adequate to run my Office Suite software and kid\u0027s software so I was able to resist the recommendations to double what comes standard.A feature I did not know I needed or would like so much: When you turn on caps lock the whole key lights up so no more wondering what the heck is going on.Durability: DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!! My V4440US hit a wall once, was sat on and was dropped once (that I saw) without noticable damage before the people under 10 may not move the computer rule was introduced.HPCompaq support calls are answered from India.","Centrino 1.5Ghz is plenty fast for my average graphic editing, office processing programs, and directx 9.0b gaming.6.","Most of the demo software is now time limited so you get a demo of Microsoft Office that expires in 30 days etc.","Switch to Mac, unless you need high-powered office software, get a Mac.","When I look back to my old renderings they look even prettier than ever before :).I run all the benchmarks I\u0027ve ever heard about (PCMark2002, 3Dmark2003) and I was amazed with how smooth they went with outstanding results.But the real challenge when we rendered same 3D Max file on the newest Machine in our office which is: latest AMD Athlon 64 bit, 2G RAM, 256MB Video Memory, 10.000 rpm HD (A real monster!) Guess what! The Toshiba Satellite P25 S670 beat it with 2 minutes!!! It was my first time to see how the HT (Hyper Threading) technology from Intel works.","I never expected to buy from an office supply store, and the price made me worry it was a piece of junk.","It also has Microsoft Office 2007 installed in a 60-day trial version, which lets you pay to unlock the full version when the trial is done.","I have owned this laptop for almost a year and a half.I needed a desktop replacement for my small home office and it has been wonderful for that.This machine gets quite hot if held on the lap and even on the desk, the loud fans run fairly frequently.","Note that you will need to get either iWorks or MS Office for Mac to have word processing and spread sheet capabilities.","By the time I was through with a four-port USB hub, wireless mouse (which I found was unnecessary on trips, but great in the office), and the power cord (which you would think could be a lot smaller), it was less than the laptop, but I was still bringing a lot with me.","The one \"office\" feature I do use is the Fingerprint Scanner.","We have Office 2003 installed, it runs like a champ, don\u0027t have any performance problems.","The only two purchases/upgrade I think are essential are to max out RAM (which should be done by yourself to save big $$$, which doesn\u0027t void your warrantee (apple actually gives you directions to do so and it\u0027s very easy)) and to buy Microsoft Office if you must comply with most who use Microsoft for easy cross communication between platforms.I will NEVER buy another computer system which solely operates on Microsoft products, with viruses, files scattered throughout, crashing, etc...I wouldn\u0027t even consider it.Do your research, talk to some apple owners, you won\u0027t miss you\u0027re PC for a minute once you have that beautiful mac in your possession.So many other reasons to switch...once you own a Mac, you\u0027ll never go back.","Especially if you are going to add office, or other software, or even have to type in a foreign language.","For one, make sure and activate your Microsoft Office 2007 trial version before uninstalling it (unless you want to buy the full product).","This customer service man from that office acknowledged to me that he has a Mac at home (which is my primary computer-but not one I can use for work training purposes).","Yes, this has been a bit annoying a few times (Especially since the Air has a disabled USB port turned off inside of it), but I have gotten around this by carrying a tiny USB splitter, and have needed to use that maybe 3 times total.I have to admit however that I also have a full MacPro, which I keep all of my files on and that the Macbook Air is my portable office.","I wish its memory can extend to 2GB or more so I can run Vista one day, but 1 GB so far is OK for XP and my other applications (Office 2007, for example).LCD is so clear and the image quality is superb.","It\u0027s easy to install open office on mac, as well as windows office -

this time a Dell - while the Toshiba spent weeks being repaired.More than a year later, I know I will NEVER purchase and will never recommend Toshiba to anyone.","If you\u0027re looking for a gaming rig, forget Apple but if you\u0027re looking for a business-oriented machine that fits in very smoothly with a PC-based office, this is the ticket.","I\u0027m convinced that once most people get one of these things home and find out that there\u0027s NOT much of a learning curve, and the lack of heat, exceptional speed (I did upgrade to 768 MB RAM), and available MS Office for Mac, they\u0027d forget all about getting their money back and decide they got a realy good deal.","We went to the local office supply store in search of a comparable computer in terms of utility and price.","Microsoft mind programmed us to use Windows, Office and wait \"stupidly\" for the new \"worse\" Windows.Mac is a really new, wonderful world.","Let me discuss dirst why i went for this machine: (i have 3 XP desktops and 1 notebook from the office)1.","If you use Skype, Office, Internet Explorer/Firefox, Mail and most other basic applications you will be very happy (once again; only on 2Gb).","As in the past lap top , speakers are not so strongIf you plan to move your office with you every time..this is a good choice...if you need just to carry documents and present them it may be too heavy for you I am surprised by the number of positive reviews and the high score that this item received.","Installed XP Pro and Office 03.All ran great for -- well, four years.","Thanks MAC for staying in there through the hard times.PS: We are still using Microsoft Office for Mac, it\u0027s a great tool.","Let the truth be told: so even if Mac viruses picked up in the last few months, it can never compare to the ongoing agony on XP machines (if anyone is counting on numbers of spy-wear, viruses, registry corrupters etc on XP. please check the stats with NSA!)i frankly just want a PC that works and doesn\u0027t require infamous:DLL error fixers!buying more registry cleaning programsbuying more antivirus junkbuying more anti spy wear junketcthis little machine is perfect for anyone who wants to work on internet/word processing/presentations/spreadsheets (although u might want to pickup an MS OFFICE For Mac.)","It\u0027s upgradeable to the latest Windoze XP, it will surf the Internet at the highest speeds your coffee shop or hotel connection can provide, and -

I have tried to buy this product from EXPRESS SOLUTIONS twice, both times after a lengthy delay, they told me the product was unailable, however in the meantime my credit card had been charged.The credit card was refunded, however they caused much inconvenience, waiting for a product that in the end never showed up.They are a disgrace and should not be allowed to trade on AMAZON.","I use it in the car when my wife is driving, in front of the TV during American Idol\u0027s many many commercials, waiting at the doctor\u0027s office, etc.","The smart/memory card slots are also handy for a family like ours that takes a lot of pictures.Because this machine was built for the office (I use it for Home), it has many features that I don\u0027t have the need for.","great condition and preloaded with OS X Tiger, And Office 2004.","Perfectly acceptable system for office work and software development.","But let\u0027s face it, if you\u0027re bringing this to the office, or library you\u0027ll have access to outlets and a surface to lay it on.Conclusion:Unless you\u0027re a teenager looking to show off your new laptop and all the games you can play, I highly recommend this laptop for serious work.","I have an iMac in my office and I like it very much.","I\u0027ve played games (though not the latest releases), developed software, and run office applications successfully on this machine.","Just plug in your device and start enjoying your work.Cons: I thought the standard 512MB of memory would be enough but definately get more if you plan to use MS office and the Internet.","Not a lot of dropped connections, but slower for sure than my PC laptops.- Bluetooth stereo support is crude, with no automatic switching between internal and wireless speakers/mics.- The leading Mac apps (iLife, iWork, Mac Office) just aren\u0027t as stable as their Windows counterparts.","See if the service center can fix it.How much longer am I supposed to wait? I asked.As long as it takes, she replied, sounding as if she were surprised I was so dumb I had to ask.She swore she would contact the \u0026quot;corporate office\u0026quot; within the next 2 days and would contact me with the results.","The following are the pros and cons...Pros...+ Super simple set-up -- took me less than half an hour to open the box, configure the system, and establish an internet connection through my home-based, WEP enabled 802.11g wireless network+ Stunning graphics display (1200 X 800 resolution is awesome!)+ Lightening fast handling of MS office applications (a 60 day trial version of MS office -- Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint is pre-loaded)+ Fit and finish are BMW-like (i.e., high speed, low drag)+ Extremely nice touch for Sony to have preloaded a decent anti-spyware application (SpySubtract)and Norton Security (3 month trial version)+ A couple reviewers have maligned the 128 MB Intel graphics card, but using an idependent test site (pcpitstop.com), the graphics card received extremely high marks+ Over-all configuration/performance are similar to machines costing several hundred more (somewhat unusal for a premium brand like Sony)+ Keyboard action is sweeeet -- so is the big and fat 100GB hard drive (can\u0027t ever imagine having the content to fill it up!)+ Comsumer\u0027s Union (publisher of Consumer Reports) continually gives Sony high marks for build qualityCons...+ Sony\u0027s knucklheaded bean-counters decided to save money by equipping the machine with a 7 foot power cord -- I have never (and I mean never ever) seen a machine in this price tier come with such a short powercord (my Dell that I use for work came with a 12 foot powercord); I now have to make a 2nd trip to the store to rectify this albiet small, but nevertheless disappointing shortcoming+ I am surprised that the built in speakers are just this side of acceptable (that\u0027s okay as I live for searching Amazon for fun peripherals!)+ I am also somewhat surprised that there are so few hot (a.k.a. quick connect) buttons for multi-media and internet apps (just two!) -- many other machines come with half a dozen or more+ Would like to see more free software preloaded (this seems to be an issue with most of Sony\u0027s machines: laptop and desktop; high end and low end)+ Touch pad takes a little getting used to (not quite sensitive enough at the default setting)Hope this helped with your search for a new machine! Never again will I buy anything Toshiba.","Even running non-native apps like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop is still pretty solid in the speed department.","My lap top is my portable office, it has a superb internet connection too.","This laptop ladies and gentlemen, is the laptop you wanna use at home, in your office, on the go, in the office shop, and in libraries.","Since it is an Apple I don\u0027t have to worry about accidental clicking that could cause viruses and with the Microsoft Office 04, the kids can easily transfer their documents and projects to any pc with Office.","It is the Best ThinkPad Yet! This is my 5th one since they first announced them in the early 1990\u0027s.Athough advertised as Win XP Pro, mine came with Windows Vista Business;and Office 2007 (30-Trial).1 GB is not nearly enough to run Vista, but this robust machine supports up to 3GB of PC5300 memory; which believe it or not cost below $200 to max out the memory!It is the heaviest laptop that I have every carried, but considering the Beautiful HD type Widescreen and Keyboard, it is worth lugging around those extra kilo\u0027s.","Also, you can customize the small business computers so they don\u0027t have all the junk programs their home \u0026 office computers come with.","it is 10 times easier to use then the regular office on windows.","I removed it and installed Office 2007 Student and Home which freed up some space.I still have only about 6 GB free after uninstalling the trial programs but that\u0027s no problem for me.Sony also makes a slim external USB 100GB disk drive (VGPUHDM10/B) you could use but I have no need for it and it\u0027s not cheap of course.Wireless LAN works great and it also comes with a Cingular EDGE card installed - you have to sign-up and activate it which can be done from the UX390N via the Internet.The wireless EDGE unlimited Cingular plan is currently about $79 a month - I can\u0027t justify that price at all and if I did I would use a USB external EV-DO modem from Sprint or Verizon, much faster than Cingular and for the same price or less monthly.I am having huge fun with the UX390N and am glad I picked it over the OQO Model 2 since the UX390N performance is double that of the O2O Model 2 according to reviews.","I bought this on sale from office depot around 3 years ago for $1100 with no warrenty.","But for average user of the computer, here is what i would recommend.First of all, if you are into home computing like surfing the web, chatting, emailing and using office type software then this is not a recommended machine.","Perhaps the only drawback is that it doesn\u0027t come with Microsoft\u0027s Office.","Battery life is enhanced by using the built in on/off switch for the WiFi chip.The software bundle is unremarkable, evaluation versions of Office and apparently a bundled version of Works.","I bought Office for Mac and the stuff I produce at work runs seamlessly on my PowerBook, and the stuff I produce on my PowerBook runs seamlessly on my PC at work.I flew from Kuwait to Germany to Newark this past week and the light weight of the PowerBook made it an instant hit with me.This thing ranks up there with sliced bread and the TV remote control.A little more room on the hard drive is all I would ask for, but, with my SuperDrive, I can save large files quickly.","They are great tools to have when and if I decide to use this machine in an office setting.","Beats all the Dells, HPs, and IBMs we have in the office.","Putting it on you lap won\u0027t have any problem at all, which is a far cry from my hot Dell.I bought this Lenovo laptop from office depot back in September.","Appleworks is no longer included, so you\u0027ll likely need an office suite, and even the included games are fairly week (such as backgammon and mancala).-Media files online that require shockwave, windows media player, etc. are often hard to find ways to run, since many of these types of programs do not yet have updates that are compatible with intel-based macs (though I expect this will be resolved within a few more weeks).-Speakers: I would definitely recommend external speakers, as the built-in ones are not loud enough and have relatively poor sound quality.Overall, aside from the flaws that can mostly be worked around, this machine is both fun and easy to use, very attractive, and most importantly can perform most tasks one might need a computer for with little to no problems.","Office 2004 for the Mac is a great bundle and truthfully better than its Windows counterpart.","When I was at Panera with windows surrounding me on three sides and overhead lights, there was a little more glare than at home - but MUCH BETTER visibility than I ever got there with my iBook.I haven\u0027t used it in an office environment, but I have used it at home with overhead lighting, and tilting the screen a quarter-inch has solved any glare problem.","I saw that installed software included Windows XP Professional Edition, and didn\u0027t realize that this isn\u0027t Office software of any kind--if you want the Office suite that is on the computer, you must purchase it separately (after a 60 day trial, if desired).","These things happen.Then I installed Microsoft Office, the MAC version.","It took a long time to get that stuff off and then to install Office and One Note from Microsoft.","Pre-installed software include AppleWorks, iLife (iTunes, iPhoto, iMovieHD, iDVD and GarageBand), iWork 30-day trial (gives you sufficient time to get an alternative productivity software like Office or the full version of iWork).","It is lacking office applications but Apple\u0027s own iWork will do or even freeware NeoOffice was recommended to me, i have yet to try either.Overall a very professional, fast, attractive, and feature-packed notebook.","The battery has lasted up 3.5 hours with normal use of MS office and desktop publishing.","This means that if you\u0027re a recent Mac convert like me, you may have to spend some extra cash on new software, i.e. Microsoft Office, etc. (unless you use Kazaa again, of course... heh, good luck on finding Mac programs on that).Despite a few compromises, I\u0027m really glad with my purchase.","Now that is unique! I plug it into the little keypad USB port and the fan is positioned on a flexible, positionable rod and provides enough air circulation to keep me comfortable but doesn\u0027t blow my paper around the office.","It\u0027s a dual boot Linux system and it is much more stable than my 17 inch powerbook.So if you want to go small, don\u0027t need Microsoft apps like Office ( I also have this on my work mac and trust me it doesn\u0027t match up to the Microsoft version when it comes to documents over 5 pages) then the macbook isn\u0027t a bad choice.","I just wish the built in speakers had more volume and that would come with MS Word and Office, instead of having to buy them seperatly.","Basically, I would buy this computer everyday of the week and pay more if I had too, everyone in my office loves this computer!Derrick I\u0027m not going to repeat everything that is already in other reviews, but it is all true.","In that same vein, there\u0027s the G4 Powerbook\u0027s keyboard that automatically lights up with a soft glow from underneath the keys as the light in your office or your airplane cabin dims.","There is an option to save documents in office as 97/2003 versions which is the saving grace of this platform.Delete all the garbage sample software programs off the computer and do yourself a favor! They waste energy and time as they pop up constantly trying to get you to buy them.Lastly, the speakers on the laptop itself are crap.","I still have 6 Gb of space available and purchased some Sony Duo memery cards at 4 GB each and have not yet needed them.The computer does store a full back-up in hidden memory whivh cuts the 32 GB down quite a bit but when I did require restoring the system it came in handy.This computer is for those who are on the go and can show presentations via Powerpoint by plugging it in at a remote work sight, connecting to meetings remotely or just wanting to read the newspaper while riding the bus to work.As far as software, I always hate trial versions, but after installing Office 2007 I had no problem uninstalling the trial version and it went fairly quick.","Cyberlink\u0027s PowerDVD/Power2Go/PowerProducer/Medi@Show, Phoenix FirstWave Recover Pro 2004 (Recovery Software), Apple iTunes, Apple QuickTime 6.5.1, Microsoft Works, Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.0, Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer 2003, Netzero Platinum, and Symantec Norton AntiVirus.","The most fun I\u0027ve had using a PC for many years.The performance is surprisingly good and I run Office apps, video, all the usual applications and web stuff with no problem at all and no lag.The keyboard is a poor design and how Sony missed the common sense of tactile keys is mind-boggling until you remember, oh yeah - it\u0027s Sony.","It makes working with a laptop much easier.This is not a video creation platform, but for everyday work in Microsoft Office and web browsing, it\u0027s a great laptop with balanced features and excellent pricing.I also recommend Gateway\u0027s service and support.","The battery life is decent but not great...I got about 3 hours of continuous usage before having to plug it in.All in all, this is a great machine for the home, office, or student.","I try not to use Office just because how slow it is on the Mac.","Many trial version software like AOL, Office 2003 etc.","Second, the headphone outlet is in the front of the computer so when I was using watching a movie on that rare flight, I had to be mindful of where the headset was plugged in.This may not be the computer for you if you want an entertainment center, but it will definitely satisfy you if you use applications such as Office or use Macromedia and Adobe multimedia software, and you want all that in a desktop replacement.","For example, if someone on my iChat buddy list is online, a green dot will appear next to a message from him or her in my Mail inbox.I also use Microsoft Office, Quicken, Dreamweaver MX, and Palm Desktop - they all work well on the Mac.","I barely have any of my own files on the C drive (most are on D which was made for extra storage), and yet, there is so much crap on it that I can\u0027t get rid of and I don\u0027t even have the minimum amount of space to do a drive defrag.- No Windows XP CD incase you need to reinstall.- Microsoft Office was only a trial (although this may be common on many laptops, I\u0027m not really sure since this is the only one I\u0027ve ever owned so far).After taking the size, battery life, and faulty Wi-Fi into consideration, I pretty much consider myself to own a desktop, since it has far less mobility than other laptops.","Runs old programs like Microsoft Office a bit slower than the PowerBook G4.","The 15\" is worth it, it\u0027s not too small or too big and heavy like the 17\". the 17 has it\u0027s place like home or office.","True, you can pay for MS Office and use Equation Editor from there, but it works badly with Pages, the iWorks word processing package, and is inconvenient to use.I\u0027m now one of the many people who is at least half seriously considering downgrading to the previous operating system, 10.4.","It set up in minutes, connected to our home wirless network and flawlessly downloaded updates to the operating system and to MicroSoft Office, which I bought separately.","Also you might have hard time to install MS Office older versions.","I also bought the MS office for this, and I love it! The Quicken that came with this machine is not some cheap 3 month \"demo\", but a full on version.","Everything about this laptop probably works great as it was intended to (e.g., MS Office, web browsing).However, I had a problem with DVD playback--the playback was stuttering.","Office shares files perfectly with PCs.HARDWARESpend the money and get the superdrive (CD-RW/DVD-R).","Office shares files perfectly with PCs.HARDWARESpend the money and get the superdrive (CD-RW/DVD-R).","I have some issues w/the Mac version of Office - but that is for a software review later.Ok - so why only 4 Stars? I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s very tough to give technology prodcuts 5 stars.","I went ahead and purchased Office 2004 to have a complete Word processing and a better mail client.All in all though a hell of a machine.","I will probably buy a new CD Reader.The Machine is still fast for regular MS Office applications (I am now running Office 2003 without any problems).I am a consultant here in Peru, and the machine has worked quite well even at 4,300 meters above sea level (about 13,000 ft above sea level)..The battery now gives me a little more than one hour.Lets see If I give another review for the next christmas using the same Lap Top....","The built-in wireless is extremely strong at capturing weaker signals throughout my house and office.","But considering that this is again for Office-type work this not so much a problem.","Microsoft Office is fast.","VAIO and DELL owners in the office are green with envy.","I am not sure what the battery life and heat generation would be without that HyperTransport thing, but this computer heats up a lot and the battery life seemed about average to me.The bundled software includes the usual junk and promotional versions of programs like Microsoft Office 2003 Student and Teacher Edition trial version and Adobe PhotoShop Album and Microsoft Muvee AutoProducer, but there is some good stuff in there too.","So, I quickly installed Firefox, Thunderbird (email), NeoOffice (MS Office replacement), Chicken of the Sea (VNC client), XAMPP (Apache/PHP/MySQL), Transmission (BitTorrent), Burn (CD/DVD burner), and Eclipse (Java development).The only way they could improve this macbook would be to bundle the DVD writer in the entry-level model instead of a combo drive (CD writer, DVD reader).","It did not come with Microsoft Office so whatever they say is on the laptop is what you\u0027re gonna get.","When I asked to talk to the main office, I was told that they wouldn\u0027t talk to customers.","Microsoft office is a lot easier to use than Appleworks.","As XP and MS Office updated themselves--and, to be fair, as I loaded additional software--performance got slower and slower.","What do you know SSH is there out of the box.Within minutes, I had downloaded eclipse, set up an SSH tunnel to my office and was working on the same Java application that I had been working on my Dell.","For documents, I write using MS-Works, then xfer the file over to the iMac desktop (which has MS-Office for Mac) for finalization.","enjoy.- Nice extras - Media shortcuts, 5-in-1 card reader, 10-key, and 1.3MP webcam are nice little additions- SLI-Ready - Not sure how functional this is, but in theory, you can dual link another graphic card for extra virtual memory and power, but I\u0027m not really sure how possible this is- Light - 7.8 lbs for a laptop of this size is not unreasonable at all! Many in its class are around 9lbs- 60 Day Office 2007 Trial - Great demo, I really like how documents take up much less space, while creating a more graphically appeasing layoutCONS:- Battery life is meh - 17\" laptops with any sort of graphics capabilites are going to suffer in this department.","You will need serial numbers for outlook, microsoft office 2003, etc.","--Much better than a palm pilot -- it really is a real laptop that fits in your pocket--It only has 1 USB but I bought a USB expansion port thing that gives me 4 USB ports and plugged it into this thing and it worked great--I live in Canada and can not use the Cingular wireless built in...but I have a Telus wireless account with a Sierra cellular wireless USB card and can surf the net, get remote access from anywhere :) Great if you want to remotely administer your computers from handheld device -- but you have to remember to carry your wireless modem in another pocket.--I have full Office 2000, Internet Explorer 7, remote acess software, and everything running on it.","The bundled apps have enabled a novice like me to prepare printed books of photos, make DVDs of my photos and home movies and even dabble in making a little music with Garageband.But it\u0027s not just about media...MS Office for the Mac blows the socks of the PC version in power and beauty.","They are not bullet proof! I use MS Office and play games regularly along with surfing the net.","Stores are very noisy and thus you cannot detect the noise then, but wait until you are at home or the office and then the noise will drive you nuts.","I purchased the Satellite 1905-S301 last month as a replacement to an older laptop to use in my office in place of a desktop.","Simply copy a version of Office from your home pc on a keychain drive and load it to this laptop.","Microsoft Office 2003 with the Office Compatibility Pack to open Office 2007 docx xlsx and pptx formats.","I telecommute, so I am at home, at a hotel or at the office working basically 7 days a week.","Some of the most amzing looking things come out of that company and you\u0027ll be the envy of the office, classroom, or jobsite when you pull this machine out.","Here is my little break down listPROS- Compact design- Awesome Screen- Great interface- Great basic software package- I dig the keyboard- Fast in most applications-magnetic adapter-office runs awesomeCONS-Running non-universal applications can be a bit slower (e.g., creative suite 2) as the program has to be translated through Rosetta-this will not be such a problem as software will become more universal for intel based macs-it does run hot, but most laptops (in my opinion) do...get a notebook cooler with this purchaseONCE YOU GO APPLE YOU\u0027LL NEVER LOOK BACK! Being a college student, I am always looking for ways to save money.","I called both my sales representative (no response) and my new contact (from Gateway executive offices) leaving 4 messages in 2 days with no return call.","After that I was rolling - set up my .MAC account and e-mail address, tested out Office 2004 for MAC (ultimately purchased).","I just preorded Microsoft Office v. X. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll love it.","The price was right, I needed a laptop for email, office applications, and general sysadmin usage.","Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta.","Since Office is not cheap, this would have been helpful information, and so I felt compelled to share.","This includes: A 60 day trail of Office 2007 (I thankfully still had 1 license left on my Office 2007 Home \u0026 Student), a suite of trail video games from Toshiba, basic software for the optical drive and a few solicitations.","Office, all of my six-sigma stuff, just painfully slow.","Except, that is, for Microsoft Office.","Programs running under Rosetta have been just fine, but I do not do video editing...just lots and lots of Office, Devonthink, Tinderbox, etc.The heat problem is not a problem for me.","You can get around this by eliminating a bunch of start up programs, as well as completely deleting several others.I recommend deleting the trial version of Office - it\u0027s a huge file and will take some time.","While the location is a bit weird, it\u0027s great having them for flash cards, scanner, a mouse, etc.The PC can also support great monitor resolution... another perk if you\u0027re using it in an Office setting with a larger monitor.Another downside is the fact it lacks a normal Printer cable connection.","I also find it very useful for transferring info from my PDA to the computer.Excellent for home-school, home-office frequent trips.","I popped in the disc for my four-year-old version of Office for the Mac and in a few minutes had smoothly functioning word-processing and spreadsheet software running the files I brought in from my office PC.","I finally happened upon the Toshiba Satellite, and it is fantastic! (Much cheaper to buy it on Amazon instead of at Office Depot or Best Buy.)I have to admit that it was slow coming right out of the box; however, after removing the unnecessary programs that were pre-installed, i.e. the trial games- the ones that only allow you to play once or twice before they try to convince you to buy and download the real game.","I purchased this Sony vaio VGN-FE670G from Office Depot about 1 month ago.","Here comes the tricky part - the Power Setting for AMD process is rather wieird.Here is my recommandation for Power Setting* When you use your laptop with AC power, set it to \"Laptop/notebook\"* When you use your laptop without AC power set it to \"Desktop/office\" mode(find this from Power Option in Control Pannel in Windows)By doing this you can save battery life by minimizing CPU voltage use and FAN use.I tried other setting and it uses battery faster.","Just about everything she needed was already on the computer with the exception of Microsoft Office.","The Apple MacBook Pro was advertised as refurbished and with Microsoft Office.","I bought this to use in my office as a stand-in PC, so naturally I wanted a large screen.","ADD WINDOWS FOR OFFICE AND YOU GET WORD, EXCEL, AND POWERPOINT SO YOU CAN SEND DOCS OUT TO THOSE ON WINDOWS.","At work the computers are all PCs, mostly using MS office, and I was able to immediately connect.","Google them before you give Uncle Bill Gates $200 for Microsoft Office.","All applications, including PhotoShop and InDesign run great and the Microsoft Office is seamlessly compatible with PC versions.","Manage thousands of your digital images in iPhoto, create home movies in iMovie, and create professional music in Garageband.Appleworks is included for simply word processing, spreadsheets, etc., but you might want to pick up Microsoft Office for Mac.","Up to now, it\u0027s still a great and outstanding notebook if you\u0027re running light software as MS Office, iTunes, some Media, etc... but not anymore for hard working.","I purchased a notebook \"lift\" from Office Max which allows air to circulate beneath the machine - this keeps the machine cooler and the fans run less.The battery life is only about 2 hours so I usually move the power cord around with me if I\u0027m attempting to use the notebook as an actual \"laptop\" computer on my lap.","For regular Microsoft Office users is just perfect.Be aware of the heat and the noise it produces.","You might pick up Microsoft Office for your office document needs, or simply purchase Apple\u0027s iWork applications (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote) from new Mac App Store on your computer.The new MacBooK Pros, thanks to Sandy Bridge technology are fast.","Works well with the new vista system and Microsoft Business Office 2007.","First thing I did was remove Microsoft Works and installed Office 2003, along with removing Norton anti-virus and installing McAfee in its place.","I tend to run many programs at once, and of course, the performance slows down, but seeing as how some of the programs include Word 2007 (or other Office 2007 programs), iTunes, and Microsoft Visual Studio, I\u0027m still happy with the performance I get out of only 256 MB of RAM.I am completely satisfied with Windows XP, and seeing as how it is almost time for me to go off to college, I am shopping around for a new laptop with Vista and TONS of cool features.","Office X is 500 dollars.","I do not use the Lenovo T60P to travel much away from home, I bought the Lenovo X41 for this and an extended battery that last me a good six hours of MS Office time (the X41 cannot handle desktop publishing but I don\u0027t require that when I am away from home--who does?).","Also comes with a trial version of Office 2003 student edition, a nice touch that wasn\u0027t listed in the specs.","Quad Core processor in a notebook Mac! Wow.I actually chose the 13-inch model for my personal use (only Dual Core on the 13-inch), but this 15-inch is replacing an aging iMac at the office to save space and leap over its performance.","I updated mine with Windows Office 2003 and OneNote and that makes a fantastic combination on the unit.","When it comes to games, quality headphones do the trick.The 80GB HD is a lot smaller than what I have in my Dell, but I\u0027ve invested in a Lacie D2 external drive which puts me at ease when storage is a concern.With Office for Mac, I can open, edit, and save any OfficeXP file I can find.","I have Photoshop CS, Dreamweaver 8, Flash MX, MS Office 2004, and more installed on this thing and it hasn\u0027t missed a beat!I have read about issues with some of the professional software such as Photoshop and Dreamweaver not being as fast on the new intel chip.","Since 75% of the work I do involves using MS Excel, Word and PowerPointk, excellent versions of which are available in Office X for Mac, I decided to give the PowerBook a try.I haven\u0027t been disappointed.","I can always see my wife and son (my wife has a MBP 15\")-Office 2008 is every bit as good as Office 2007 for Windows-Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight! If you don\u0027t know what this is, Google it! :)-Expose-iWork 08 is nearly a replacement for Office 2008-Scrolling built-in to trackpadThat\u0027s about it for now.","Definitely good for home/office users, but travelers might certainly want to look at something else less heavy and w/o a noisy cd player.","Non-Universal applications (MS Office, QuickBooks) also launch quickly and have run very well.","One nationwide chain had a contract with IBM which would amount to at least 14,000 T22 Thinkpads in just their local offices across the US.","That is unless you buy a third party plugin for Office.","Plus the cooling fans (at least three that I can account for) make a tremendous amount of noise, which is distracting in quiet office or meeting settings.The biggest strike against this laptop is its physical design.","Unfortunately, it didn\u0027t come with the option of bundling Office 2007 products with.","Great concept..poor quality! had it for a week now, for less than 200$, it worked great.i installed windows 7, arrived with 1.5gb ram, so it operates all tasks as net, office and movies.","The only thing bothers me is that there are too many trial software (AOL, MS Office 2003 60-day trial) so I need to spend one hour to uninstall them.","I tried playing Civilzation III on it, and it wouldnt even start the game.Like I said, regular programs are great on here, I make powerpoint slides all the time, and it does awesome for it.Pro\u0027s:Great screen, one of the best I\u0027ve ever seen.Excellent ability to run Office ProgramMouse Pad, never had a problemWireless Card, picks up great.","The machine is fast even when running older apps (like MS Office 2004), its been reliable, and after a few setup headaches (I admit I was trying to do fancy stuff) I have no major complaints.","An I book comes with AppleWorks, thats Apples version of Office, so to speak(write).","Excellent for light office/work use and excellent for surfing the net.However: 1) The DVD player does not function at all on moderately-worn rented DVD\u0027s, sound is distorted on light- to medium-used DVD\u0027s, and the DVD player is only satisfactory at best with brand new DVD\u0027s that have just been opened.And: 2) All USB ports have ceased to recognize my Memorex M-Flyerstorage device, as well as all other plug-in storage devices.","Don\u0027t expect to play games on it.Full Review:Got this Presario V2555US for $579 after rebate from Office Depot.Seems to serve well for basic net surfing, word processing, playing movies and listening to songs etc.","As I wanted this laptop to do was some basic home office stuff and mainly games.","Also, Microsoft Word/Office is not included, except a trial version.","Need to load it withNeo/Open Office and uninstall the MS Word Test Drive Suite.But i am impressed with its performance , especially when playingVideo CD or DVD and other CPU intensive graphical appsIt has not crashed/hung except once when i trued to make a copy of a Music CD when it was being copied to a burn folder.Underlying OS being Unix like, should make it easier for some users to Tweak and Configure the system.The one thing that Apple can improve is to try to make the surface finish as scratch proof as possible, and the latest version of iLife suiteshould be provided as a free upgrade.Also the Software to Burn CD/DVD can be made a little more interactive.","Strengths: Great display with super sharp resolution; good battery life; superior sound from built-in Harman Kardon speakers; built-in infrared and wireless; CR-RW is great,I copied and burned more than 100 CDs!Weaknesses: Quite heavy; low video graphics memory; doesn\u0027t come with any MS Office software, could at least install MS Word for free; Intel Pentium Centrino 710 is entry level in its class.Summary: (...)So I\u0027m using it over 2 years now and so far it was a great notebook.","The only drawback of this system is hard drive space, but that can be replaced easily enough.Buy one, you won\u0027t be sorry! I read once that Vaio\u0027s are the Holy Grail\u0027s of the notebooks...Indeed they are top quality machines and you pay the price for it...We must admit that there is a bit of Brand value to it as well...But you will be very satisfied with this one, specially if you demand more then just office tasks....By the configuration of it, you know you are looking at a fast machine, reliable, and light !! Definitely a plus..After reading lots of reviews on the internet and seeing it before buying I can account for three issues that Sony could solve at this top quality Notebook (yes, nothing is 100% perfect), things that are to improve something that is at the top of the tide, that does not require an extreme ammount of engineering...1) The fingerprint reader could be place away from the touchpad and buttons..","I was able to clear off enough that I could install Office 2007 Enterprise and a few other utilities, and still have 7 GB free (+1 GB for hibernate file).It would probably be perfect if it had a 64GB SSD HD, 2 GB RAM, a discrete graphics chip, Core Duo CPU, higher res camera (with optical zoom), and some faster way to boot up.","This version of Office is tops for speed and just plain ease of use.","If you don\u0027t feel like paying for either you can go open source with StarOffice, an OSX port from open office, which is a pretty decent alternative.","I got one for $400 from office depot with Vista home basic installed.","I use this for home and office use and i\u0027m really glad that i invested in this piece of hardware.","Windows XP and the provided Office XP trial combined to use sufficient memory resources as to prevent an excel spreadsheet from opening in less than 2 minutes and then in processing it in less than 4 minutes.","To start off i must say that i have been a Windows and Microsoft-only user for the past 10 years, so this review must be followed as a guidance for those of you thinking of switching to a Mac more than the already convinced long time mac users.Apple, has always tried to make of their computers, a funnermachine than the spreadsheet-oriented Microsoft\u0027s, but the latter has always been a faster computational computer, which is why it was very hard to find a Mac in an office.","With this macbook I didn\u0027t notice the difference between Office 2004 and any other application in terms of behavior, it\u0027s fast enough to run universal, intel or ppc applications with no practical difference (at least the low and medium-class ones) and without upgrading RAM.","However you will loose the warm and fuzzy buttons and Compaq \"officer friendly\" screens.As the story goes, in notebooks, the price and the performance do generally go hand in hand.","For some reason many MacBooks won\u0027t read a genuine MS install CD, again days I wasted that you just saved- if you really need to use MS Office, be aware of the compromises, especially in Excel, they\u0027ve taken away some power user features from Mac Office 2008 that are available in the PC version.","So, as long as you\u0027re not looking for the performance of a dual-core processor, you\u0027ll be able to run your basic office applications and stay productive with extended use times.","I use it to watch and record TV shows, play DVDs (via LG 32\" Plasma EDTV), downloaded Atari, NES and Super NES emulators, and purchased all of the Need for Speed Series for PC (bar the ProStreet, which I intend to buy in the near future), and of course, for work (Office 2007, Acrobat 8.1 and all the bells and whistles).","Open Office also works fine.All in all this is a great machine and well worth the money I paid ($800), especially since I had been considering a used Thinkpad for $500-600.","On the right, we have 2 USB 2.0, external monitor output, card reader, and DVD-writer.Bundled Software (mostly trial bloatware junk): Yahoo! Music Jukebox, Google Desktop, eBay (for some reason, theres a shortcut to an eBay executable file), Intervideo WinDVD, Microsoft Money Essentials, Microsoft Office 2007 trial, Microsoft Works, Ulead DVD MovieFactory, McAfee Internet Security trial, Protector Suite (for fingerprint reader).Strengths:- Compact \u0026 Lightweight- Built-in microphone (contrary to a previous reviewer, there IS a mic)- Built-in fingerprint reader- Glossy ScreenWeaknesses:- Is fairly thick for a compact notebook at about 1\"+- Keyboard layout isn\u0027t that great- Weak speakers, no bass.","I\u0027m not able to burn anything to the CD Burner (try contacting HP Support in India - had several VERY frustrating calls to support (where their focus is to UPSELL me on additional warranty and a \"Great Deal\" on office 2007 - HP India support is a total and complete joke) Another example, is the Docking station that can be ordered with this also failed and i\u0027ve been waiting two months and still no replacement.","It comes with the usual Windows/MS junk such as MS Works, MS Office Evaluation Copy, etc.","If you typically have 10 or 15 instances of web browser and memory hogs like photoshop, dreamweaver, and office applications running while listening to streaming radio and downloading bit torrents, you too will need more.Fortunately, acer seems to be putting in a single 512 stick allowing for easy expansion in the open slot.Just compare all the features and specs on this one and you will see that it\u0027s a great value.","toshiba includes works 7 and office student edition along with microsoft one note.","Runs MS Office 2007 with a breeze.","Basically, this is an attractive laptop.This laptop comes with the standard home software (alas, no microsoft office).","I bought a wireless router and i am video chatting with my friends all over the world lying in my bed.Pros: lightweight, whoever sees it with you see that you have a style, long battery , relativly fast performance with pics and videos , very good keyboard i can type faster on it than my pc and doesnt tire my hands , sony picture and vidosoftware is great, the built in cam gives you the freedom t o re cord a meeting easily what i often do since ..in fact that is why i shoose this model, excelent screen quality , if you buy it you will be simply happy with it, but dont forget this is a second notebookCons: if you are not a mediaperson like me and rather wanna use it for business like word, office ..i wouldnt suggest it cause this screen is too small for a long use with document.","The hysteria about older software not working with Vista seems overwrought; Corel Wordperfect 2002 worked at once, MS Office 2000 needed a repair install and produces some hiccups but now works.","For basic browsing and office needs, this computer works just fine.","There\u0027s no reason to buy Office when you already have it on another pc.","I work at an office that has decided to go wireless.","AppleWorks is Apple\u0027s version of Microsoft Office, similar to iWork, Apple\u0027s newest application suite.I received the iBook in September, amid much anticipation.","Bought the Averatec AV3225HS in November 2004*love the slim \u0026 light profile*AMD processor is a better product than the Intel chips, but the average user cannot tell, but will feel good about not caving into the Intel monopoly (my desktop PC is also an AMD processor :) )*DC adapter is designed well and not bulky and does not take up space on your wall outlet*came with XP software and will automatically update*have installed several home-user software (MS Office, Quicken, etc) without issues*battery life is about 3hrs, about 2 with wireless modem on all the time*Wireless modem works very well, as does the builtin ethernet connection*dvd player/cd burner works well.*if you\u0027re looking for a great laptop that works straight out of the box..this is it!!!!

They do not know the reason.","(Style is KEY!) I was working in a very relaxed office setting over the summer in a web development company, and the girl I sat next to is a hardcore Mac addict.","Also the price was below that of others selling the same item and the addition of Microsoft Office 2008 was a nice bonus; I have only MO 2004 .Robert Weathers Overall I have been very impressed with the performance of the laptop to this point.","It took me several days to install my normal applications (Office, iTunes, Adobe, etc) and configure to my preferences.","If you belong to Amazon prime, then shipping is free, a few more bucks that you save and you can put toward buying MS office.","MS Office ran a bit slow under Rosetta but a 2GB RAM upgrade made a big difference and I would highly recommend it.Can\u0027t believe all the bad reviews this machine is getting, either I got very lucky or some people just like complaining about successful products (did somebody say iPod?).","But Microsoft Office 2000, Adobe Photoshop 7, DartPro xp all work fine.","Very stable os and if you need that MS Office Suite, it is available for Macs.","Others sell for a tad less, but you may settle on compromised support and the product.Lastly, Windows XP, Office XP and internet surfing are a breeze.","One side note - this was the only toshiba model that had this problem that Office Depot had on display.","Excellent warranty for the price.Loaded softwareThe minor Office Works or whatever it is comes loaded.","I am using this as a replacement for my iMac which I moved to the office.","I set it up for the office network with barely any effort.","Plus I had already run Industry Standard Diagnostics software to test the memory.Battery life in my opinion is excellent - about 5hrs with the two 3800mAH batteries installed - surfing, MS Office applications, music, Windows Media Player running at same time.","I have used powerbooks and macs for a long time, and these machines and this version of OS are simply the best, more agile in windows networks than windows machines themselves! There are so many other stunning things that this machine can do, and I am having fun in and out of the office: the best $3000 I have spent, on the machine and upgrading the RAM to 1gig.","Looks like my notebook is headed for a head on collision with my Range Rover....OOOPS! And Toshiba America is being handled through my state\u0027s Attorney General\u0027s Office.....better luck to those of you out there with this computer! I bought my PowerBook about a month ago, and it is simply the most wonderfull tool I have ever purchased.","In daily use(office aps, Net surfing, etc) it is just as fast as my M1730 while possessing a much better battery life and lighter weight.","Comes with Office 2003 but it is only a trial version, if you want to keep it after 60 days you have to buy the cd key.","I found that it has some difficulty running applications like Photoshop CS3 and Nikon NX2 however, it does well with MS Office 2003 and MS Office 2007.","Am I going to have to wait until Half Life 2 comes out (and chokes on old drivers), and everyone complains due to poor performance of the video card for Toshiba to maybe do something? Does Toshiba seriously expect me to ever buy anything they make again if this continues to be a problem??? (i\u0027m going to say hello to alien ware, LOL) The funniest part about all this is that the stickers on this machine when you pull it out of the box advertise the geforce fx card for gaming.Also speaking of the video card, why have 32 MB of RAM on it with no offical way of upgrading (i guess i could always ask yoshi on tech tv if there is a way i can mod this thing LOL)? This alone will probably make Half Life 2 unplayable at a decent resolution whenever it comes out.If you are a Toshiba employee and you are reading this, show this to your bosses and show them that there ARE customers who actually expect their hardware to work as best as it can and if a company is too LAZY to ensure this they WILL look elsewhere when the time comes to buy a new machine (due to moore\u0027s law it will be sooner than later).","After speaking with a Toshiba rep on the phone I was told that their offical policy is to not make updated drivers unless a MAJOR problem happens.","There are also after market car and airline chargers available which will effectively allow you to work from the time you leave your office and fly to a far off destination.","If you need MS Office, it\u0027s available for the Mac (and the Mac version of Office is actually better than the PC version).","Setup is reasonably brainless, and while Sony did include a bunch of trial software some of it is useful - Spy Sweeper, Norton AntiVirus, and MS Office all are nicely preloaded.","Finally, it doesn\u0027t come with Office 2003, you can buy it for $149, but then the value for the system comes down a little bit.Overall, this computer is a do-it-all all-star.","This notebook more than meets basic to medium home office needs.","And the volume and mute buttons are fiddly.The tight packing of so many components does cause a little interference in the built-in speaker--this disappears when connected to external speakers, but it kind of makes it useless as a personal DVD.That said, if you really want a full functioned office that you can operate from anywhere, you can\u0027t go past the new TX series.","I got mine at a local office supply store (named after a common desk item used to secure pieces of paper together with a small piece of steel wire), for just a bit under six-hundred dollars.Anyway, it\u0027s pretty speedy, even running Vista home premium.","I do hook up to a full keyboard/monitor at the office, but I don\u0027t feel compromised on speed or functionality.3.","Luckily for me, I bought mines early the week before the sale started to guarantee obtaining one for myself.It comes with Express Media Player, Microsoft Office 2003 Standard Edition trial, Microsoft Works, Microsoft OneNote, Microsoft Money Trial, Yahoo Music, Napster, AOL, MSN, Spatializer, and Virtual Sound pre-installed into the system.","Software: Windows XP home edition, Microsoft Office Small Business (including outlook, word, excel, and powerpoint) *note: office is an add-on and does not come pre-installed8.","I just purchased this system from Office Depot for $[..] it is the very best system today for the money.","I love my new Macbook, but I was very disappointed to find out that it doesn\u0027t actually include Microsoft Office, like it says on the website, but only a thirty day trial.","The laptop originated in China.I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the IBM ThinkPad.The machine is garbage!I could have done better at Office Depot! I think that overall this is a good computer.","For under a thousand bucks you get a fully equipped notebook with an upgraded 1.2 GHz processor (the most powerful of the previous line), a wireless Airport Extreme card built-in and a new suite of apps including Panther 10.3.5, iLife\u002704, 30-day trial of Microsoft Office 2004, Quicken 2005, World Book 2004 and two new games.","My next step is to contact Toshiba America corporate offices.","There\u0027s Corel Paint, Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office, Quickbooks, etc.","I mostly use it for wireless internet surfing, email, office tools and some games, and it\u0027s great for that.","The package was duly taken to the Post Office, insured and tracked.","Got home, popped in the 4GB of RAM (2 - 2GB sticks) and BOOM, I\u0027m flying through Leopard and back to work in under an hour.One week later, I\u0027m running vmWare w/ Windows XP Professional \u0026 Office 2007 Ultimate, Microsoft Office 2008 (Educator Copy), and iWork \u002708.","Basically a suite similar to Microsoft Office but not as robust and not costing 400-500 bucks.","I just bought this laptop a couple of days ago, and I can\u0027t say anything else but I love it!!It is extremely quiet (hardly any HD noise) and all the multimedia features on it were just what I was looking for.I\u0027ve been working with IBM laptops before this, and I must say that this is more of a home laptop than the IBM\u0027s just because you can do anything you want with it because of the multimedia options.The only \u0026quot;bad\u0026quot; thing in the package is WP office, as the whole world is using MS Office, but that\u0027s just a matter of getting MS Office.","not only was the computer new looking, but it was also preloaded with many different programs i would\u0027ve downloaded later, such as open office, firefox, etc.","Even the low-end ibook has a faster processor (the 12-inch with 1.33 ghz) Also, the price difference is mainly due to shipping, which dell offers for free on top of the 34% discount that you get on the laptop.Another thing about the dell 600M is that you have to add-on all of the software, security and wireless capabilities.Looking at the software, you have to purchase Microsoft office in order to attain the same degree of productivity that you can get with ilife on the ibook.","Everyone in my sister\u0027s office used one of these and told me they were very durable.","I am using the T60P using windows XP Pro (today\u0027s year is 2012) to write this review using MS OFFICE 2003 and connected to the web via Google Chrome.","I was unable to access the 60-day trial Office package.","I use this for work as well as some play, and while hard-core gamers might want an AlienWare unit, the vast majority of serious gamers would be happy with this system.For business applications the system is probably overkill, Microsoft Office runs flawlessly, and I also use the system with Visual Studio, SQL Server (MSDE and Express) as well as Virtual PC / Virtual Server.","Do not buy the windows office program.","10 seconds to boot up Office?

will not repair the computer under warranty in the 15th month, even though they repaired the same problem six months ago.I have another HP laptop (dv5000) which had a serious conflict with an HP All In One.","Luckily it happened so soon, that my system is still well under warranty, but it\u0027s due to be repaired by replacing with a similar, faulty designed board.","Instead of being apologetic, they attempted to charge me to replace it (never mind that I purchased an extended warranty and had owned the computer for less than a month!) and insisted that I give them a credit card number to \u0027secure the repair, in case the warranty wasn\u0027t valid.\u0027","The warranty has now expired and this piece of junk is worse now than ever.","I had to send it in for warranty work for the keyboard and got it back in a week.","Amazon is not \"set up\" to do something as simple as send a customer an OS install disc to fix a problem clearly caused by their own product data.Long story short, I did call Apple and, as it\u0027s still under warranty, they dropped a Snow Leopard disk in the mail and will be here in 2-3 days.I requested that Amazon change the product description, so I\u0027ll update this review as soon as it\u0027s published.","I hated to send it back to Amazon (I\u0027ve had great luck with almost EVERYTHING I\u0027ve purchased from Amazon over the years) but feared that greater problems lay ahead of the warranty.","So I sent it for repair just before the warranty expired.","I wasn\u0027t sure that it was really all that High-Def, but when I watched the trailers for Hitch and Resident Evil 2 on the disc (in the extras), they were also in High-Def, but MUCH clearer and look amazing.Pros:+Very fast Processor T7400 (2.16Ghz x 2, 4MB cache)+2 GB of RAM+Blu-Ray+15.4\" Widescreen with WSXGA+ (1680x1050 resolution)+Light-weight at only 6 lbs and barely a inch thick.+Battery life is over 3 hrs, sometimes 4+ hrs when on max battery save mode+ Barely ever uses the HDD in regular use, has so much RAM it just stores everything there.Cons:-Tons of ACER crap that comes with it (it takes about an hr when you first turn it on, to install of the ACER stuff, it does it automatically)-Hard drive is partitioned into two 80GB FAT32 partitions, which sucks for big files over 4GB, which don\u0027t work, unless you uninstall it and then use the backup DVD you make when it boots to install the drivers and special software.-ATI driver is proprietary and huge! 500+ MB-Speakers are very high pitched, squeaky and poor in comparison to my 8 yr old laptop-Acer website is slow and no drivers on it yet for this laptop-Screen is dark compared to my other 2 laptops, even on highest settings, the screen is only about half as brightI also bought the 3 yr Total Replacement warranty which makes my laptop insured until 2010, when I can upgrade it again.Overall, I am VERY pleased with my purchase.","It worked great until last week (oddly enough only a few weeks after the warranty expired).","If you want a nice looking unit, with a year warranty that has a great screen, this is for you.","The LCD screen WILL break under normal use and Sony will not honor the warranty if the screen fails.","So, say you are a college student writing a final paper or a business executive writing a big proposal or just a video gamer trying to beat that final level, you might just find that *poof* your computer is no longer on! Now, one might say, \u0026quot;well, that\u0027s why we buy warranties!\u0026quot;, but no, this didn\u0027t start happening to me until shortly after my sweet, sweet warranty expired.","Product had dead pixels, and the space bar key does not enter spaces unless pressed EXACTLY in the middle!HD full of trial software and self promoting programs that need clean up.Lacks Blue Tooth \u0026 IR connectivity, or CF card slot (mentioned in Tech Spec, but would have been a nice feature).Otherwise a great system for $1100 or less.Buyer beware...Addendum: Out of warranty, but keyboard fixed gratis by Toshiba.","So I\u0027m thinking when you buy a DELL Dimension get one of these things thrown in.Also, there are limited drive bays but, in a USB/Firewire world does it matter?Finally the thing is dead quiet - my old Gateway sounds like I\u0027ve left the vacumn on, but this Dell is whisper quiet.Overall I\u0027m three days into it... took a while to kill the AOL virus they load on the darn things and the stupid free trial Word Perfect junk, but so far so good.Hopefully it\u0027ll last like my Gateway (blue screens of death now and then but my Gateway keeps on chuggin\u0027... 7 years now).Oh, by the way, DELL support is pretty good but you have to talk to a computer for 10 minutes and sit on hold on a fuzzy line for another 5 before you get a real person who has to put you on hold 7 times to answer your question... then they try to sell you someting else like a warranty or other \u0027program\u0027... but hey, they\u0027re really polite...","Between the bad customer support and the billing for defective parts under warranty, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be purchasing a Toshiba again.","Don\u0027t buy this laptop without the extended warranty.","After that the computer worked two more years then stopped working, but it was out of warranty and literally falling apart (the keyboard popped up in places) so I went to a neighborhood store and bought a $600 Toshiba, which has worked great for the last four years and also has way better quality sound and graphics than the Thinkpad, the tradeoff being that it does weigh more.The x61 I bought is less than a year old, and the hard drive is now nonfunctional.","If anyone knows how to fix it or how to get Sony to fix it after the warranty has expired, email me at the following address (minus the spaces:) j i m w c a @ y a h o o .","For the first two months of ownership, Sony will sell you their own extended warranty (with telephone service) but there is a catch.","Luckily it was still under warranty, however the headache I went through spending hours on the phone with customer service in a another country, and waiting days on end for a manager to call back was not worth it.","Exactly 12 months later, a week after the Gateway warranty expired the CD drive went kaput.","By the time you add to this what you would need to make it sweet you can just buy a new one, software all included with full support and warranty.","The warranty has paid for itself.","Unlike what the reviewer says about the UK, there is no service charge for warranty repairs in the States.","After much hassle, they agreed it was under warranty and repaired it.","It carried a one year warranty.","I bought an extended warranty when I bought the laptop (Sony Metreon in SF) so I better not encounter any issues with that.As of now, it\u0027s not evening starting up.","Long story short--I have now sent it in for warranty repair THREE times and it is still not fixed.","In meantime, your warranty clock continues running.","Sony insisted to charge \u003e$250 to replace it because the warranty was just for one year.If you check Internet, you will find low quality fan is wide spread problem in Sony laptops.Be aware: Sony sells such low quality product at high price and then makes another round of profit by repairing it.","It was under warranty so I sent it back and got a new one.","I had this laptop for a little more than 3 years now and at first it was great, worked great was awesome, and then 2 years ago it overheats and shuts down, I called Sony, the warranty was out, it would cost 400 bucks to ship it get the fan fixed and ship it back.","At two months, it is now worthless.I called Best Buy\u0027s warranty service today, and they can no longer find any records of anything; not the warranty, none of the numerous previous calls to tech support, not the repair job, not the case number, nothing.It doesn\u0027t seem worth spending much time pursuing the problem, because a new motherboard will just have the same problem.","They claim they have no video cards in stock and I will have to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement card, 2-3 weeks for a loaner system, or 2-3 weeks for a replacement system -- basically my NEXT DAY warranty is anything but.I explained that this is a mission critical system and a 2-3 week delay is unacceptable given the high price I paid for the next day warranty.","Also, the warranty covered the repairs.","I explained the whole story and they said \"Sir your warranty does not cover physical damage to the machine\".","Turned out that the video card had failed.I contacted Dell customer support to activate my next business day warranty and after more than a week I have gotten nowhere with them.","However, the DVD+/-RW drive gave up its ghost recently, so it was time for warranty service, and that is where Averatec falls short.","i bought this refurb pc and i really like it.it has great sound and is pretty fastthe graphics are great for the average person.the seller was really good about the warranty and responded to my questions promptly.i would buy another one of these I bought this same machine with a larger, 80Gb drive for two hundred dollars less at my local CostCo.The Centrino is a big win over a Pentium 4 for laptop use: lots better battery life, less heat.","I purchased this laptop new in 2008 and it has worked like a charm! I immediately upgraded the memory to 4GB; although I knew with vista I could not take advantage of the entire 4GB.The Duo processor does support 64 bit , so I\u0027m upgrading to Windows 7 to finally use all 4GB memory and most of my applications should perform fine.I did use my extended warranty twice this year for damage I caused! The only issue I have is the fact it does not support the installation of a 2nd internal hard drive although the space is available but no connectors.But for the price I paid, I\u0027m happy! Got it from local CompUSA, the last week it was in bankruptcy business!One discrepancy, the laptop has 6 USB slots not 4 as indicated in the technical description.Toshiba Satellite P205-S6347 I purchased this laptop not too long ago, and so far, it\u0027s proven to be very nice.","Once before, I think the motherboard fried and the local repair shop (under warranty by Toshiba - which is GREAT) took care of it but notified me I needed to spray (air cannister) the vent more often because it was quickly getting dirty (remember? Subway system, outdoors all the time, etc).","And Toshiba service center refused to offer warranty and they are charging me 500 US dollars for the drive including service fee.","I upgraded the RAM, the HD, and installed the Airport Extreme card, + the applecare warranty extension, all for less than $1200!!! Ofcourse, this was through my university, so non-students may not be able to find such a good deal.","She found the HP representative in Capetown where they informed her that they would not honor the warranty because it had the US suffix (like in DV6450US).","Got it for $899 + a$200 gift card with which I\u0027ve purchased a 3 year warranty.","HP refuses to admit the problem, they will \"repair\"the problem during warranty, afterwards in my case with both my systems they \"repaired\" it one more time again at no charge.","HP consistantly said that my warranty expired.","I also paid $5 for a neoprene sleeve - it will fit into any bag or backpack easily.I highly recommend getting the extended 3yr warranty with Service Guard and LowJack for $295 - it is great b/c if anything happens to the laptop (i.e. drop or spill), they will fix it for free or replace it.","I got it fix - thanks to warranty purchased.","Couldn\u0027t get a refund or replacement because it was past the 30-day warranty.","The only time I\u0027ve dealt with tech support was within the last week--I wanted to verify the correct RAM specification for an expansion to 1GB from 512MB, which I will install after it is out of warranty (it\u0027s DDR 333 PC2700 200-pin SODIMM 2.5v 64-bit, in case you\u0027re curious) 6) I use the built-in wireless as my primary connection at home and while travelling (T-mobile HotSpots) and have had zero issues with it.","Averatec customer service indicated that if it was an LCD problem it probably would not be covered under warranty, to be determined by repair facility.","I have not experienced any problems with the keyboard buttons, but my solution is simple- ALWAYS purchase a service plan that goes beyond the manufacturer\u0027s warranty.","Here is what I have received so far from:I am glad I read these other experiences first.From : SquareTrade Costumer Support \u0026#60;best_jkr@yahoo.com\u0026#62;Sent : Saturday, December 4, 2004 7:26 PMTo : paulSubject : Re: Sonyright sir,and please e-mail the SquareTrade after you will made the payment with all the informations to : support@squaretrade-customer.comThanks!paul wrote:Hi,I have alll information ready to send....just wanted to confirm everythingbefore sending it.You are selling me this exact model notebook for .....$765.00 usdright?....NEW with all accessories and O/S ....warranty?Sony VAIO VGN-A290 17\u0026#34; Notebook PC (Intel Pentium M Processor 735(Centrino), 1 GB RAM, 100 GB Hard Drive, DVD+/-RW Double Layer Drive)Sony CEWhat do you guarantee and for how long?Paul\u0026#62;From: SquareTrade Costumer Support\u0026#62;To: paul\u0026#62;Subject: Re: Sony\u0026#62;Date: Thu, 2 Dec 2004 02:13:43 -0800 (PST)\u0026#62;\u0026#62;\u0026#62;Hi\u0026#62;\u0026#62;I want to complete the deal trough Square Trade Service..\u0026#62;\u0026#62;How it works Square trade ??? 5 Easy Steps:\u0026#62;\u0026#62;Step1: The buyer and seller agree to the terms anddetails of the\u0026#62;transaction.\u0026#62;\u0026#62;Step2: The buyer sends payment.","The keyboard is also very robust (I\u0027m a \"hard typer\" and typically wear through keyboards in a year - this one\u0027s never needed any work) and the Sony warranty is a good one (I fried a motherboard two months into owning it - replacement was quick and easy.)CONS: Like seemingly all Vaios, it feels a little fragile - lots of plastic.","The second reason was the extended factory warranty offered by Toshiba ( a must have on any mobile device ) was far more comprehensive and less expensive then the competition.","It\u0027s still shutting down.Of course, there is a one-year warranty and my unit is 14 months old, so I was told I was out of luck.","It was all fine and I was deeply impressed with how well it suited my simple needs for such a low price -- until the hard drive died on me after six months!So I said, stuff happens, there\u0027s a one-year warranty, let\u0027s send it in.","She\u0027s 88 and it gives her smiles each day! My grandson likes his apple macbook pro laptop a great deal,but it would be nice to get the promised rebate!!All paper work was acknowledged,but no check as yet!! My hard drive for this machine crashed 2 months after my warranty expired; I lost an immense amount of data, and had to send it to Sony\u0027s repair center to get the drive replaced.Sony\u0027s repair center took one month to perform the 20-minute task of switching out the hard drive, and held the computer hostage after incorrectly submitting my credit card authorization for payment, twice, and after I called to check on the status of the repair twice.","I got to use my extended warranty and had a new hard drive installed.","If I needed a 4 hour battery, I would have stepped up the line and bought a higher priced Toshiba.WarrantyKeep in mind, regardless of where you buy this machine, you can buy a warranty for any Toshiba product from Toshiba on line.","About 6 months ago, the motherboard crashed...conveniently 1 month after the 1-year warranty expired.","With such an expensive Sony battery, and a lot of problems with other brand batteries, it may be worthwhile in obtaining an extended warranty to cover a replacement battery.","Also its Widescreen feature makes you to watch DVD\u0027s in great quality and comfort.All software comes within a DVD and you don\u0027t bother much with tons of CD\u0027s.It has international warranty and an universal frequency adapter which allows you to use the laptop anywhere around the world.It has got quality Harman/Kardon speakers which sounds very good.","The only problem was that it is as heavy as a tank! I took it back.If my wife and child don\u0027t keep their hands off my Compaq, you are going to read about us on the front cover of the newspaper! Peace!

combat what the person said above, first you should always take the extended warranty no matter how much it costs, it technology and it can malfunction.","Shortly after Vista identified a series of

warranty for a few hundred more that the repair bill that included a 30-day warranty.Toshiba\u0027s refusal to stock adequate new repair parts, and their abysmal warranty on USED parts should make any consumer considering the purchase of a laptop think long and hard before buying one from Toshiba.After my $2000 investment in a top-of-the-line Toshiba has turned into a useless paperweight, I won\u0027t make that mistake again.","That \"there is physical damage, and that the 1 year warranty does not cover physical damage\".","I also paid for the 3 year warranty, and I turned it in to get it fixed after it had fell (that was my fault).","Their warranty does NOT guarantee a computer that will EVER work -- only endless repair attempts.","They refused to give me a new computer or even to

the special shipping to send it to Dallas.I would not buy this laptop again.","Bang it goes back again and 2 weeks later it is returned once more.It performs well enough with some service calls but I figure I better buy extra warranty which I am happy I did.","Having loved my P25 and P35 Toshibas with seventeen inch screens I tried but couldn\u0027t resist this P105-S921.If you\u0027ve read my reviews of those models, you\u0027ll recall that I recommend the extended warranty with accidental breakage plan.","It is full sized but unforgiving and a special effort to hit the keys dead center is required.The Sony comes with a one year warranty.","I did not pay over USD$3500 to be hassled by asinine warranty regulations and shody construction.","If its not warm/hot it wont load programs

They would not even provide a shipping box at my expense to get the machine to San Diego, which is where all repairs are done.","Fix #2 lasted only 2 months and they tried to stick me for another $649 by claiming I physically damaged/cracked the LCD which voided the warranty.","Once I determined that Toshiba would replace it under warranty, I bought a larger and faster Toshiba drive.","A hot CPU can run for a year till it fries some MB component and then a computer that worked long enough to be out of warranty now starts giving you problems, or even no longer works at all.4) It comes with Vista.","I had to remind them that I had the computer for 11 months and the warranty was good for 24 months.","I explain my situation that they had my computer for 2 months during my warranty and also that my computer is mal-functioning because of their error.","This isn\u0027t covered by the warranty, but if they are going to use cheap cases they shouldn\u0027t charge so much.Things I love - the screen is very nice and I like having a big hard drive.","4 individuals (one brain dead, one total indifferent, one telling my that my year warranty did not include the hard drive and one that disconnected me,) the last tech told me to send it back and it would be two weeks before I would get the machine back.","With toshiba, you have the option to upgrade your 1 year standard warranty to 2/3/4 years during your first year which is good in case something nasty happens to it :).","I am trying it out but the bad part is I only have 3 months of warranty.","There is supposed to be a 90 day software warranty.","A previous Clie I had also died almost exacty the day the warranty ran out.Sony\u0027s customer support is legendary in its lack of helpfulness.","I called and they stated that my laptop must have had water spilled on it and they would not repair under warranty.","HP told me to pound sand, and I should buy a new wireless card for $90... one month out of warranty.","But if you were smart when you bought your computer and you have the warranty, they will fix that right up for you.Now, since I am an audio engineer I use pro tools with this computer.","With Duo Core Intel FAST processors, 256MB Dedicated Video, large 100+GB Hard Drive (5400RPM - fast for laptops), beautiful high resolution easy to view screen and a sleek package UNDER 4 Pounds!!

My daughters had both saved money for about a year for a computer.","For $1040, you were able to get a 12\" iBook with a free upgrade to 1GB RAM and AppleCare (worth $249) which extends the warranty to 3 years.Needless to say, the white polycarbonate casing of the iBook sets it apart from the competition.","So tonight I called the warranty company gain.","It\u0027s painful to have to take *20* minutes just to get through the identifying information of who I am and what model I am calling about - I kid you not.HP bills their support as \"Total Support\", but I would rate it as anything *but*.Do yourself a favor - closely check the support availability and warranty policies before buying any computer.","My superdrive stopped working within my warranty period, but I had it replaced by apple promptly.","well i found one thing bad hp provides wolrd wide warranty as i asked from compny but seller saying its only for US. tht thing i found bit weird.","After purchasing I called to add the extended warranty on the earlier computer.","I would still recommend to get the extended warranty possibly from the store where you are buying.","Of course, any damage you cause to the machine would not be covered under warranty.","There is a real problem with intercompany communication as well.In conclusion, if you are going to risk going with Acer, I highly urge you to go the extra mile and buy the extended warranty.","So, quite a few in-warranty problems, but email-based tech support was good.","One time HP fixed the issue with their \"limited warranty repair\" Limited has proven to mean \"limited time, screw the rest of you\" Run from this computer.","If you are looking at purchasing a laptop, make sure you do your homework on the warranty and reliability of the item.","Its just over a year old and just off warranty.","I tried to get apple to fix it, however, they said that buying from amazon voids all warranties as they are not an authorized retailer.","At that point, I called HP support to report a hardware problem and get warranty support.","I contacted Sony and they told me that the warranty on the battery was only 30 days and that I should buy a new battery.","Sadly, standard warranties do not cover the operating system (they consider that software), and getting these problems fixed has been a headache and an unwelcome bill.Speaking of audio, the speakers are so low that you can\u0027t use this computer to play music or a DVD, unless you\u0027re right up at the screen or have the headphones in.","I would advise a 3 year warranty to be safe, laptops have issues more often than desktops according to most! Also, grab a bluetooth mouse, and a cover/case on the way out and youll be all set!Enjoy the quality! Compaq 2701 does not work at the moment, because of some problems with Windows XP.","However haven\u0027t i been in Iraq it would never occur well i fried my mother board also at that time the fan was making more noise than normal and the technicians told me that it was extremely dirty not a surprise since I was in the Middle East - it was a relatively easy fix since It was under the warranty - lucky me! I sent it to sony they replaced it and returned to me fine and since then not even one single complain.Since 2004 I\u0027ve been to over 7 countries and always had my Vaio in my bag (a map bag).","Please dont buy this laptop, i got this and seven months later the hard disk crashed, also the asus support is terrible they didnt gave me the warranty for it, thank god amazon could help me and solve my problem, thank you to all amazon staff again for this.","I bumped up the memory to 2GB just to give Windows room; it may be possible to run with just 1GB, but I did not mind spending the extra $140 for the memory.Plus points: powerful processor, big big screen, nice enough keyboard, quiet fans, nice speakers, bluetooth integration, price is competitive with other PCs.Negative points: DVD drive died and replaced under warranty in the first week, big screen means more weight, and hot machine (don\u0027t put it on your lap unless you are sitting inside an igloo).Intangible point: a Microsoft consultant said to me: \"Your laptop is really cool; who makes that?\" Ha.","And now it stopped working AGAIN and when I contacted HP they said they wont replace it for free because my warranty expired.","The service has been horrible and TWO replacements have broken down completely.I\u0027d go with just about any other computer brand, or at least not pay for a warranty that is essentially useless.","It had two repairs within the warranty period.","Good thing the warranty is good for a year.","I called HP and went through a lot of stuff, until they decided it was a problem with the hard drive and they said they would fix it for free (still in warranty).","If you don\u0027t have to go through them for your warranty work or technical support, then the computer is a good choice.","They refuse to do anything to help owners, and hide behind the expired warranty.","Finally got the thing fixed and was happy with it until, one of my speakers went out right before the warranty expired.","It came with a 10 GB hard drive, the operating system took up most of that space.I also purchased extra memory from the merchant (MacMall) which was installed at time of purchase.I had never before been disappointed in a Mac - it was my 4th mac purchase.Because it was such a dog, I never used it much and finally well after warranty it broke.","I\u0027ve only had mine 3 weeks, but so far, it really rocks! If you buy a Sony laptop, be prepared to pay \u003e$250 to replace a dead fan after the warranty expiresI completely agree with the review by [Laptop Professional \"Anonymous Owner\"].","The IBM is less than a year old, and has already had the motherboard replaced under warranty.","I decided to purchase the warranty after the breakdowns that occured within the manufacturer warranty period.","Toshiba had extended the warranty on my system for one year after purchase.","Luckily, she bought the extended warranty, so hopefully the service won\u0027t be as bad as what others have experienced.My parents have also had tremendous trouble with their Vaio laptop.","Luckily I had purchased an extended warranty when I bought it but I won\u0027t get my laptop back for 2 to 3 weeks.Hard drives should not die after one year of use.When I brought it in for repair the guy who was helping me said that the hard drive on his Vaio, which was also about a year old, had just died too.","Thankfully I purchased the warranty, because the power supply completely broke and needs repairs.Heed the warning and do not buy a Compaq.","No longer charges the battery (motherboard again but now I am out of warranty)5.","The HP people were wonderful and the turn around time for repair was surprisingly quick - I got my computer back in a couple of days with a new keyboard.My CD burner stopped working recently, but the repair is covered under my extended warranty through Circuit City, where purchased.I am a graphic and web designer and run fairly large programs and have a lot of open windows in Firefox.","Apple replaced the first one under the extended warranty (which is a good idea for a traveling notebook) and I will need another one soon.","However, when the computer was just over 14 months old (not quite three months out of warranty), the keyboard failed completely, and I had to purchase an external USB keyboard to be able to continue using it.","Buy an extended warranty if you can and look at IBM (now Lenovo) or Dell as they highly reliable laptops.","My warranty expired on October 26th while actively dealing with the original issue.","I personally going forward will probably buy cheapy laptops, or refurbs more often and just buy extended warranties with them.","It took 2 hours on the phone and three supervisors to get the warranty-covered repair authorized.When it was working, the computer ran much more slowly than one would normally expect, even taking into account slower-than-average processor than is usually found in notebooks now.","My experience has been that Toshiba does not stand by its products, cannot repair the chronic problems with this series and will not extend warranties or offer replacement to customers who have endured numerous \"repairs.\"","How bogus an excuse is that? Also, the warranty is only good in the USA.","That device had to be sent back four times during its one year warranty period, before finally dying out completely just about a month after the warranty was up.","Still, it shouldn\u0027t have been so fragile.The good news is that I sent it back to Sony, who say it is under warranty, and will replace the LCD. beautiful screen, nice keys very fast and powerful.","Don\u0027t waste your time spend a hundred dollars more for a much better machine.They sent a recovery disk without a product key.You would do better to build your own with parts of other machines than to buy from these people.I will never make apurchase with them,again Do your research... or you can replace the motherboard right after your warranty and then again right after the repair warranty, and then again, and again.","The only thing worse is the HP ze 5270 I originally bought a HP Pavillion ZE 5270 after 6 months it died and HP will not honor their warranty.","I configured and ordered pc on Lenovo site with extended support and warranty to the tune of over $2,000, and they indicated 2 weeks shipping, which was a week too late for me, but I agreed.","I\u0027m calling the extended warranty people and trying to get my computer guru guy at work to help me.","I call to Sony and because the warranty was expiring they can\u0027t give me another or fix it without pay for the service.","the girl in line next to me was also having her Vaio worked on...I guess I\u0027m just saying watch out, it may seem like a really good idea now but these things seem to have their problems right after the manufacturer\u0027s warranty has ended.I\u0027m really gentle with my laptop and I\u0027ve never mistreated it or dropped it or anything like that.","The Compaq had motherboard problems repeatedly, they warrantied and with the funds I got I was able to buy this beauty.","His needed a new hard drive within 4 months \u0026 was replaced on warranty.","I purchased the extended warranty from where I purchased my unit and am hoping that they will not tell me the same.I\u0027ve always been a fan of most HP products but I\u0027m now dreading the idea that I may have just flushed over $1000 down the drain.","The first three were free because of warranty from our four different computers, but now they refuse to send more so we have to buy them.","I did buy the extended warranty after reading other reviews about Toshiba products, just to be safe.","The motherboard failed in the first year, fortunately about a week before the warranty ran out, and so IBM replaced it.","I contacted the Acer warranty department (after 20+ minutes on hold).","Luckily it was still under warranty.","Both computers became very sick (memory slot problem, dvd-rom problem, lcd problem, etc) just after the warranty expired.","So I called Gateway, and explained what it was doing, so they told me to send it back because it was still under warranty.","If you can afford to throw it away if it breaks out of warranty go ahead, buy it.","I call HP and they tell me that the warranty expired and they can\u0027t do anything about it.","They took 3 weeks to find my serial number and then they said I have to pay $336 as the display is not covered under warranty.","I claim for repair under warranty to Sony and I had to ship the computer to San Diego,California paying all shipment expenses.","It sure is a lot easier to take your time and make up your mind on what you want instead having a salesperson sell you something they have to get rid of or are overstocked and then try to sell you extended warranties etc,,,,, I was very pleased with this product and the vendor supplying it.","I, like to many other people, bought this Sony laptop...The DVD-RW never really worked that great but after 1-year it died completely...My girlfriend also bought a Sony Vaio a few months after I did and the DVD-RW died on hers too...Its amazing how things like this happen right after the warranty expires...Almost seems like the Sony engineers design them that way...My laptop overheats like some of the other reviews have stated...I find that if I continually blow the processor fan off with compressed air to keep the dust down it helps a little...Sony Technical support is a Joke...My suggestion...Don\u0027t buy Sony...Go with Toshiba...You will be much happier...As for me...I will never purchase another Sony product again...","Whether on warranty or not this should be repaired or replaced if there is a design defect.","Just had the main board replaced due to a problem in power management and continuous shut down.(at my cost since it was 3 mos out of warranty).","Yesterday the \"new\" hard drive put in under warranty AGAIN went bad.","My 6 month old machine was shipped with the wrong operating system (Averatec blamed Amazon), the keyboard was defective, and when I called for warranty service, I was treated like a felon by Averatec \"customer service\".","Might be wise to get the 3 yr extended warranty with it.","Now my system is whisper quiet, the fan hardly ever comes on, and the system runs ice cold.I am not sure who was responsible for shipping an unsuitable OS initially (CC or HP), but cudos to HP for eventually getting the OS right and for standing by their products when the motherboard began to show some serious issues out of warranty.","They responded by giving me an extra year of warranty.","I did not pay over USD$3500 to be hassled by asinine warranty regulations and shody construction.","To fix it you just take it to the Mac store with your original receipt (and what sane person would throw a receipt for a $2200+ computer away) and they\u0027ll fix it under warranty.","Since getting a dock though, I\u0027ve chosen to forego the fingerprint reader completely.I purchased this thinkpad with the accidental damage protection warranty, which means I can do nearly anything to the thinkpad I want, and it will be replaced.","The extended warranty was a waist of money as was my purchase of these 2 pieces of garbage.","It\u0027s all under warranty, but the still a hassle.","Even if there are known defects in the computer, Sony will not honor the warranty if there are any things that they determine are not due to normal wear and tear---even if they have nothing to do with the manufacturing defect.Buyer beware.","After your warranty expires, the laptop will fall apart.","The visit is supposed to be covered under warranty, but I haven\u0027t taken it in yet to see, so I can\u0027t say for sure.Other than those issues, this thing is great.","I have a averatec 5110H model laptop.PLEASE DONT BUY anything from averatec.The laptops monitor had a problem only after a week i bought.The customer service is VERY VERY bad.They take 2 weeks time to repair/replace anything.This is during the warranty period(1 yr).Thereafter,if anything goes wrong you have to ship it back to them,as they dont sell any of their parts outside.Now, this time they took 4 weeks time to repair.Compare this with DELL/MAC.its a 3 days reponse time.","I explained to him about how careful I had handled it and it was either a manufacture flaw or either Best Buy and poor handling by them.I explained to him that after paying $2,400 with extended warranty I was extra careful.He kept on pointing the finger at me.So the bottom line is I have to pay $783.00 for poor workmanship by sony.","While heavier than some others, that heft ensures longevity with minimal care! I bought a Vaio laptop in June 2003 with a 1-yr warranty.","Hp did allow me to purchase the warranty service ever after 1 year of expiration.","Spent 3 hours last time over spark fiasco to finally talk to someone who tells me I have to send it in and they may or may not cover all of the above problems under the warranty.","And, sadly, I must join the list of owners who had one just die--completely die--on them soon after the warranty expired.","It is an extra warranty that adds 3 years to the parts and labor warranty.","Just two weeks past the end of the warranty period, and the machine is dead.","How does one inquire about the useless battery?

Best Buy told me it needed a new hard drive and it probably needed one for a long time (like that\u0027s what should\u0027ve been fixed when I sent it to Gateway).","Getting my wireless network installed at home was another matter.One of the big selling points for me was the unlimited toll-free support from Gateway technicians as long as the product is under warranty (the first year).","I know it\u0027s the motherboard and did I buy the extended warranty you ask, the answer again, sadly, is no.","You can draw your own conclusions of what I think of HP worldwide warranty.","It went 4 times to the repair center indicaed by Toshiba and they were not able to fix the problem (it is under warranty).","Hers is newer and sometimes newer is better, but at the time I was on a limited budget, she was not.I have done a number of tweaks to get more performance out of mine, though I have done none to hers so not to void her warranty.","I had a 15\" Dell Inspiron laptop that just went out of its extended warranty, and I wanted to buy another laptop on MY terms, rather than scrambling to get a new one when something bad happened to the Dell.","I also purchase a new extended warranty to keep them working on it.","They claim that their warranty policy only covers the repair of the original computer.","I\u0027d probably go and buy the 2 year warranty as this issue showed up two weeks before the one year warranty expired.","When you press the top of the computer, behind the screen, the screen flexes and is not strong.Sony did not offer an accidental extension to the warranty when I registered the purchase online.","If it wouldn\u0027t void my warranty I would Put Linux on this machine and at the very least XP Pro, if I could get away with putting either one on I would be giving it 5 stars.The Hardware though, is the most important.The processor is excellent, the 512Mb Ram makes the computer run pretty smooth and is upgradeable to 2GB (You should seriously consider getting at least a gig of Ram to really see what this machine can do!) The 60 Gig HD is fast and perfect for serious mobile users.","My laptop was under warranty, and when the charger went bad, after a couple of months, I had to call them several times, and it took two months for the replacement to arrive.","It does not happen until the warranty is expired.","The keyboard/trackpad design, in particular, is very good...full size dedicated page navigation keys, a dedicated key to bring up contextual menus, another one to call up the Start menu, a two-button trackpad with scrolling support...Battery life has been solid, the screen is sharp and the built-in SD card slot matches the format used by my digital camera.On the down side...as expected, battery life hasn\u0027t quite matched the published specs and the optical drive is a bit noisy.For an extra $230US, Toshiba added a 3 year warranty with \u0026quot;express\u0026quot; pickup/delivery and coverage against accidental damage.","in order to get repaired, must 1] take to an \"authorized service center\" in the states or 2] they will send you a box you can ship it to them, but must pay $24 for the box. and they only partnered UPS. no UPS in Iraq and nearest repair shop in Kuwait,but not covered under \"international warranty.\"know of several other service members with this type of notebook that have had display or battery problems and now out of $1Kguaranteed to have problems if you buy this.","I was given this computer to replace a constantly-overheating Dell XPS generation 1 since it was still under warranty with Dell.","Once my warranty runs out I know I\u0027ve as good as lost this computer.I loved Mac but after all this all I can say is do yourself a favor and avoid this laptop.","i think, if you own a toshiba and live in America, AMERICANS SHOULD HELP YOU!!

Anyway, tech support stinks and so does the laptop itself.If you do buy, buy an extended warranty.","Also be aware that at this point, warranty has very likely expired on any of this particular model you find, so you\u0027ll need to know a local computer shop that has good repair rates if something goes seriously wrong.","FORGET IT! I have a warranty that covers replacement should I physically break the unit, yet when I I politely request that my lemon of a notebook please be replaced, I am told no.","For months, the techs tried to convince me that my issues were software related so they refused to comply with the HP warranty language.","It\u0027s very fragile and best used as a small desk top.Worse, if you have to deal with HP support, you will end up with a poor VOIP connection to India and may have support denied because HP tracks it\u0027s warranties based on when they sent the machine to the retailer, not when you bought it.Even then HP support is, in a word, terrible.","Currently the laptop is being repaired by HP because of a screen flickering issue, the warranty proccess was extremely easy.","The same problems resurfaced after the warranty expired.","As the customer service rep said over the phone: \"You either pay us whatever we charge to fix it, or you have a broken laptop.\"I mentioned that, although my warranty was only a year, one month of that year was spent without a laptop because of faulty equipment that came installed on the unit.","It got to where we had to jiggle it and turn it just so, until we saw the blue LED light and saw the battery indicator show it was charging.The jack never felt like it was totally pushed in, from day one, but it got really bad after about 2 months.Since it\u0027s under warranty, HP took it back, and I am hopeful it will be fixed; however, looking at many computer forums where people sent their HP laptops in 3, 4, 5 times and more, I am not hopeful.A brand-new computer should WORK right out of the box! You shouldn\u0027t have to send it back after only 2 months of extraordinary gentle use!Stay away from HP until they acknowledge this design problem and stop making laptops like this! I had mixed thoughts about buying a IBOOK.","I spent an hour and a half on the phone with Sony\u0027s script-reading, eager-to-help but not particularly useful technical support, but, alas, the relationship that hard started so promisingly now took an ugly turn.So now, I sit with a $1300 (+tax) paperweight while I wait for Sony to send me a box in which I can ship my 3-week old machine back to them for repair (note, Sony does not offer local repair as an option for notebooks under warranty.","This product is a sad commentary on Sony\u0027s design standards and on its unwillingness to stand behind its warranty.","While the gentleman on the Apple Support line was very friendly, in order for the warranty to kick in for any repairs we had to take it to an authorized Apple dealer in order to diagnose the problem before anything else could be done.","Sony fixes.The Ugly: at month 12, my warranty is expired; the system runs hot ALL THE TIME.","The screen went bad, even covered by warranty they refused to to recieve it.","They thought me a good lesson NEVER EVER BUY EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM RETAILER.The only good thing about this laptop - it has a cool design! But I better go for Sony for my next laptop.","Their warranty didn\u0027t work in my case.Therefore, I strongly do not recommend this product.","They don\u0027t phone back (big surprise)and claim that, by law, they have 30 days to do warranty repairs.","Great!!!!This is my last repair and my warranty is up.","When I asked if doing that would void my warranty I was told that as long as I removed the retail version from my system and restored the Toshiba version they would help me with hardware problems.","Mine was in repair more than in use until the warranty expired, then it failed again.","I didn\u0027t worry because I had purchased the 3 year warranty.","Their initial service was excellent, but do not buy their extended warranty because they will not respond to you if there is a problem.","I won\u0027t go through the other defects other than to say I wouldn\u0027t DREAM of getting a MacBook/Pro without getting an extended warranty.","Thankfully, it was under warranty, otherwise it would have cost more to fix it than it would to just buy a new computer.","I don\u0027t know how this came about but I know the case was intact so I didn\u0027t drop the machine or drop anything heavy on the case.I purchased the Macintosh with a three year \"AppleCare\" warranty (at a very steep cost).","They were going out of business but the stores had no issue with trying to sell us a warranty they would not be around to service (geesh!).","Rather than return to Amazon, I merely brought it to a local Apple store since I was likely to get it back sooner than arrange for pickup and redelivery with Amazon and obviously it was covered under warranty since it was non-functional out of the box.","I then bought a huge warranty plan, so I could get it fixed, then got vista installed (because it clearly says \u0027vista capable\u0027 on it) and vista is so awful on it, that I can\u0027t wait to get it off, but I have to pay more for taking it off! What a complete waste of time and money.","She traveled to South Africa where it developed screen trouble (vertical lines) before the warranty expired.","They do not have the proper cost benefit in my opinion.4) No IR port! I don\u0027t nee this, but I\u0027m sure others might (and I may need it in the future).5) Sucker is big compared to the newer laptops out there, although it still falls in the extremely portable category.6) VERY weak warranty.","Sure, it has a 1 year warranty, but is being out of a computer for weeks while it is sent back to the company worth the 50$ you\u0027d save by buying a different brand? I don\u0027t think so.","Thankfully I purchased a 3 year warranty because I used it up! Two power adapters, two displays, and a cooling fan replaced.","Buyers be wary, and if you do buy make sure you buy the extended warranty with it as well.","These warranties will ususally offer a full replacement on the screen once no questions asked and this covers a drop by your kid.","When the warranty replacement drive arrived (the exact original model) I put it into an external accessory case.It was a little annoying to have to take it halfway apart in order to upgrade the RAM, but I found good instructions online, and it turned out not to be a difficult process.The photo currently on Amazon makes the red mouse appear wireless - it is not.","BEWARE of this product,the screen damages easily and is not covered by sony\u0027s warranty-it will cost you up to $500 to have it repaired on top of the$2000 it cost originally.I am of course worried that this will happen again in the future andI continue to carry my Dell with me wherever I go.SONY HAS ANOTHER PROBLEM THE SIZE OF IT\"S BATTERY PROBLEM AND WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS SOON Beware.","I wasted about a month on their incompetence and deception before they called me and said I have to pay for the motherboard because the motherboard is not under warranty.","However, when the computer was just over 14 months old (not quite three months out of warranty), the keyboard failed completely, and I had to purchase an external USB keyboard to be able to continue using it.","I had to wait 8 months for my supplimental warranty to replace them because HP would not.","I\u0027ve had three of these things because they all crashed when brand new (the warranty gave me new ones, thank God); all the \"talk\" about Mac lately boggles the mind.","The laptop is still working well, no problems so far since it\u0027s been \"out of warranty\" (fingers crossed).","Any laptop at any price is going to need some tweaks to operate efficiently with the drain Vista imposes on memory.I give this 5/5 stars due to the surprise 1 year warranty, Vista Premium, and the $399 price tag.","I spent the extra $280 for a 2.4 Ghz Toshiba - and it screams - and so far, so good...By the way, \"everyone\u0027s\" answer to this is \"buy the extended warranty\" - fine, lesson learned, shame on me...","Even with a one year warranty, HP would not fix the problem.","I bought the $300 mega-warranty through Toshiba upon registeration.","I have been carrying it from work to home for a year now and am about to get a lighter replacement.- The pretty silver finish where you rest your palms wears off.- Same for the lettering on the keys.**- the last notebook I had for 3 years had the same issues and a 3 year warranty replaced the keyboard.","I did not get the extended warranty that Best Buy suggested, which I wish I did.This is my first notebook, and for only paying $699.00 for it, I am pleased.","Like I do with all my laptops (this is my third) I bought their extended warranty so I can\u0027t say anything about Avaratec\u0027s service.","Not a big deal to me b/c that the setting I keep all my monitors at.In conclusion, I strongly recommend you purchase the deluxe extended warranty which will cover all issues.","Also, the serial connector on a standard issue mouse is incompatible with the mouse port here, a real bummer.But I paid little more than $500, with shipping and a 90 day HP warranty included.","T-series has 3-year warranty.","The people that handle the extended warranty (bought through the official SonyStyle website) are a pain in the as S.","so I bought a 3 yr warranty ($200 more) to be safe, but its been working great so far for the 8 mo I have owned it.","I too have found it impressive.If you buy it locally, get the extended warranty.","It came with a 1 year Warranty.","Extended and personalized warranty options, LOCAL service centers (neither Dell or Sony has that...) and training for those people that aren\u0027t as computer savvy as they would like to be.","The laptop is great, but suppouse the condition was new, but under the sticker say 90 days of warranty........to bad The laptop is great for me.","Its NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600 has been said in the trade press to fail many months after purchase, often after warranty expires.","It only came with a 90 day warranty from Gateway, but I was able to contact Gateway and get the warranty extended to a full 3 year deal (I had to pay for the extension of course).","Well, since I am 2 months out of warranty, NO ONE at Compaq or HP would even discuss this option with me - I had to go to \"retail\" i.e. Radio Shack (puleeeze) or CompUSA or Best Buy (choke) ..","Guess what, the key jumped out ! So now I am living without the \u0027control\u0027 key because the WARRANTY DOESN\u0027T ALLOW FOR COSMETIC CHANGES.MY REVIEW A MONTH AFTER I BOUGHT IT ----I bought Toshiba Satellite M45 more than a month ago from amazon.","I tried to return/exchange the computer due to a breach of warranty/contract and have them send me a new one.","That taught me to ALWAYS buy screen replacement warranties)Seems to me after all of my machines that the more you baby a laptop the more fragile it becomes.","What is stopping it from failing again when it\u0027s identical to the faulty board that went bad in the first place? What happens when it does and my system is no longer covered by warranty? There are reported cases of the problem reoccurring.","Given that it\u0027s a laptop all the hardware is theirs, so I think they ought to pay to diagnose it.Bottom line: HP apparently feels that an $1100 laptop should work well for no more than the year or so that it\u0027s under warranty.","Called the warranty service who advised me to send it to the Toshiba depot for repair, as opposed to taking it to a local service center.","I called Circuit City extended warranty.","But it turned out I didn\u0027t need the warranty at all, it expired in March without me using it.When I first bought this laptop I worked for a University in North Carolina that was a authorized Gateway service center (which is why I bought a Gateway).","After researching this issue on the Internet, I have found that I am one of a very large number of people encountering this problem with the HP Pavilion laptops.Most people have tried contacting HP support only to be told that it is not covered by warranty and requires you to pay for a full system board replacement.","Lest you think maybe I\u0027m just not following directions, my husband also could not get the install procedure to work, and he has an MS in computer science from Stanford.Another few hours on the phone, including one support person who hung up on me, yielded the info that I could go to a local warranty service provider and have them \"reimage the disk.\"","These two ailments team up to create quite an annoying pair as the computer will shut off without power!All this in UNDER A YEAR! Yes, it\u0027s still under warranty.","I\u0027ve had it for 16 months, taken care of it as well as an overwhelmed PhD student could possibly manage and I\u0027ve experienced nothing but problems (ones that are QUITE PRICEY now that the warranty is up).","As soon as the warranty expired on all other issues, they stopped responding to the same one we have had since the very first day.","Another e-mail from Sony saying there was all of a sudden physical damage and that was not covered under the warranty.","However, the worst part is that I shipped it to HP under warranty.","Get AVERATEC or Amazon to commit to a warranty - notice that none is posted.","The DVD drive died while in warranty and getting HP to replace it involved many hours of arguing with their overseas support people.","The warranty was good, so Toshiba replaced it, but they put a had a pirate version of windows on the new drive when I got it.","So then I go back to CPQ/HP and have a chat with them - Finally get a sympathetic ear in Seattle - run the SN# and then she kicks me over to the \"CPO\" (custom products div?) and they blow a fuse because the gal prior was not even supposed to \"speak with me\" unless I was under warranty...","People look at it and say \"wow\".But, why would anybody pay more than $2,000. for this computer when a machine (even a laptop) with larger capacity, bigger screen, more USB ports, more memory, larger hard drive, better warranty and less expensive parts can bought for much less?The answer is: a footprint smaller than a letter sized sheet a paper; full networking; a built in CD/DVD drive; built in fingerprint reader; bright, high resolution screen; a seven hour battery life even when networked; more than adequate memory and hard drive suitable for all but heavy graphics; the ability to play DVD\u0027s without starting up Windows and a total weight of less than 3 pounds.My first concerns were: Can someone with \"older\" vision and reflexes actually read the screen and use the keyboard?I found that, although bright and clear, the screen is definitely small.","When I phone back, they still don\u0027t know about the part, and claim that, by law, they have 30 days to do warranty repairs.","I purchased the 3 year warranty having many previous laptops.","Just buy a regular laptop with +++ years of warranty if possible and that\u0027s the best option.2) if you have money to spend, go for it.Sincerely,A Former Customer.PS\u003e I also have an iPhone 4 and wanted to buy MacBook Air because I saw the new technology in it, but after this...","I bought the 48-Mo. warranty extension from Circuit City, so I don\u0027t feel any need to be concerned.","There is a dial for speaker volume - nice.You can buy a 3 year warranty from Toshiba for $120.","Expect to be transferred from person to person, to have to explain your problem repeatedly, and to have to fight for your rights under the warranty or service agreement.","This iBook arrived with a keyboard problem, but I was able to get it fixed for free, because it was still under warranty.","If I had to pay for warranty repairs, I\u0027d be pretty steamed! It\u0027s now 2007 and it\u0027s been two years since I purchased this laptop.","Plenty of cool stuff and used to be a good value for money at acquisition (march2006).Draw backs: Speakers are terrible (miss the Harman option) and processor overheats Notebook shell and mouse pad making it unpleaseant to use.Last, but not least, the screen started to generate an inch wide vertical line that soon after expanded into a second one and who knows where this will end (september2006).A shame warranty does not cover it!Tom Pluses, I got mine for the cheap, \u0026lt;$650 US, with a sale and the no tax holiday in NC.","Normally I would have purchased an extended warranty but have heard nightmares about Amazon.com\u0027s warranties so I stayed away from the whole issue.","I did purchase the Sony extended warranty and will be trying to get the card replaced soon.","I called the HP costomer service and I was told my warranty just expired last month so I couldn\u0027t use free service, but it really occured within warrenty.NEVER BUY HP PRODUCTs! THEY ARE SUCKS! I bought this computer a year ago to use with basic programs such as powerpoint, excel, word, and outlook.","I called HP and even to get one day\u0027s assistance, it was an absurd amount of money.I\u0027d recommend this laptop only if you\u0027re willing to get an extended warranty and are using it more for fun than for important information.","It worked just fine until a couple of days after my one-year warranty ran out.","Gateway also has priority warranties that provide loaner systems to clients who cannot be without a computer.","Since it has been just over 14 months since I purchased the computer, it is no longer under the 1 year warranty through Toshiba and now it is having an operating system failure which Circuit City will not fix even though I have the two year extended warranty.","The edges of the screen get dead pixels very easily so now my screen is covered in them at all edges.-Everytime I boot up my computer it takes me to the setup screen where I have to reset my date/time settings and I get a low battery message even though the battery is full and the AC adapter is plugged in! Now that I\u0027m past my one year warranty, Averatec offers no help with this problem.-Customer support is terrible.","Sure you do not get a 3 year all inclusive warranty, but you don\u0027t need one because your power inverter is not going to break, you logic board is not going to die and your hard drive won\u0027t crash.Stick with the Vaios and you will be happy you made the choice.The only drawback with a Sony is the proprietary parts.","I called HP and they said they cannot do anything since the warranty expired.","During the one year HP warranty, I had to send in the battery twice (defective, not holding charges), and the laptop once due to not powering up one day.","Although I may switch to an Apple but if I stick with PC its only HP for me!Oh! By the way, my 1 year warranty was due to expire 3 weeks after I placed my call to HP, Lucky me!Just to add on the product itself; It\u0027s a good system.","Toshiba can no longer meet warranty requirements and must take parts from junked portables or return refurbished computers with a 90 day warranty that Toshiba knows they are not able to repair when they break.","The Powerbook has a one-year warranty and only 90 days of phone support.","I won\u0027t be buying another Sony Vaio anytime soon.In the last year, I\u0027ve had to have the hard drive replaced TWICE, (along with the keyboard, video card and CD/DVD drive last February - not that anyone told me WHY) and it takes FOREVER for Sony to get the parts to their authorized service centers (in my case, a CompUSA where I, thankfully, bought an extended warranty).","Very crisp, clear and bright.Yeah, the warranty isn\u0027t so great, but I bought a 2 yr. warranty through CompUSA for $349 that covers everything, even the screen.If anybody has any questions about this laptop, I highly recommend it and you can e-mail me your questions at:JJS070470@cox.net.Thanks! I just bought this laptop in june.","Unfortunately, based on other web postings I expected that the memory issue would not be resolved.So I returned my unit under warranty and it ended up stolen in transit while being shipped by the Compaq shipper Airborne Express! Good riddence! The claim however needed to be processed by Compaq.","I go the Apple Care Warranty for peace of mind but have not had to use.","Sony not only will require you to buy expensive external equipment to diagnose *any* problems (of which there are MANY-my motherboard died horribly, took out most of the guts with it) causing you to spend almost $500 more to do *their* jobs for them.Don\u0027t even think about spending money on an extended warranty, its just a way for them to get your money and then, again, they make you purchase more expensive hardware to do any diagnosing before they will even talk to you on the phone.Sony is not a company I will be dealing with ever again...buy ANYTHING but a Sony... you can\u0027t afford all the parts you need to do THEIR job for them.","Out drama began on the first day of setup and has not ended, and our warranty expired 3 months ago with the same case number as the first day of setup.","I had the Satellite 1415-S173 for three years -- during the first year I had it, it blew a hard drive (thankfully under warranty).","At first they wouldn\u0027t repair it because I was out of the warranty period, then they changed course and said it was a special recall item and that they would.","I would love to get this fixed, but Gateway killed all their retail service centers - so I have to pay $45 to send my laptop in, on top of the $200 I paid for an extended warranty.","The first one went bad and was replaced under warranty by HP.","It does have a good warranty and Apple retail stores are everywhere if you need help.It\u0027s a wonderful product.","So now I am trying to get the money back for the extended warranty I paid for nothing.","i\u0027d be worried i\u0027d break it, except i did go to sonystyle and buy an accidental damage extended warranty just for some peace of mind.","It appears that this is a known problem with this model and HP has a limited 2 yr extended warranty program, which by the way, starts from when you buy the notebook and not after the 1 yr warranty expires! I was able to send it in the first time to get it fixed free of charge to HP.","A couple minor problems, I would recommend at the very least getting copy of all the drivers for it before doing that again!!.Sony support was what I expected, I called to ask them if it would support XP-Pro and she said yes, but the warranty is void as far as support, no big loss there.","Get some external speakers or headphones.Also, note that sony skimps on its warranties-mine came with only a one-year limited warranty for parts and service and 90-day free technical support.","With my particular Latitude C600 runs of 1 Ghz Pentium Mobile, 256 RAM, 20GB hard drive + my portable 40GB hard drive and CDRW disk drive, I couldn\u0027t have found a better solution to my problems for a price tag around $250 and a two year warranty on it and its proven to be a very solid machine.","(The last time they serviced this model, they had to order FOUR main boards before receiving one that worked!)* These used parts carry only a 30-day warranty.* The cost for the main board is $560 plus $110 for install.","I sent it back under warranty and it was repaired.","I can pretty much guess this laptop will never make it past the warranty, and I\u0027ll keep losing everything, at this point.","If HP successfully (and enduringly) mends my wireless problem, I\u0027ll update further.Overall, this is serviceable, but the jury is still out.XXXXXXFollow-up, April 5, 2007: HP returned the repaired machine, complete with a new motherboard, within a week of my request for repairs under the warranty.","They say that a broken LCD is absolutely not covered under warranty, no matter what the cause.This after spending 2 hours on the phone with three different offshore support center operators that were beyond difficult to understand.","If you buy from an authorized Sony dealer like Amazon you can still upgrade your 1 year warranty by contacting Sony directly.","I have always liked Toshiba but after wasting so much money on one I will never get another.Pro\u0027s- Very nice looking machine loaded with features, nice sound (for a laptop), and very clear and bright screen.Cons- noisy fan, runs hot which probably contributed to the short lifespan .Power supply also gets very hot.Toshiba mobile services NZ wanted to charge me $1500.00 for a replacement motherboard and provide just a three month warranty on the repair.","It\u0027s a refurbished laptop that supposedly comes with a 90 day warranty, but upon inspection - the receipt as well as the manual say this unit has a 1 year warranty through HP.","As I didn\u0027t want to deal with the headache of it breaking down again, which I\u0027m sure would\u0027ve happened just like with my Satellite Pro, I simply sent it in to have fixed (btw, the 1 year warranty expires immediately after they fix the first problem and their customer service department is horrible) and just gave it to my computer illiterate uncle, who rarely if ever uses it.","I like the fact that it is a factory warranty and not a 3rd party vendor.Since buying the 1415 in early December it has performed quite well with no issues, acting as both my desktop and mobile device.","It may sound petty, but it hangs around the top of your screen at all times and it will get under your nerves in no time.In all, you should be able to judge from looking at the specs that it\u0027s not really a value buy and the review should help you understand not to buy Toshiba laptops in general, with their cheap plastic chassis, non-durable hard drives, and poor warranties.","I have talked to other people about this and it seems these pcs are programmed to have problems like this after the warranty period.","I bought a new HP Laptop a few years ago, which has had it\u0027s share of problems as well...only saving grace is that I had, and still have the full extended warranty.","A good PC technician can fix the problem in an hour with a screwdriver and a soldering iron, but you don\u0027t dare go that route if you have the warranty from Averatec in effect, or an extended warranty.","How can that be, you ask, when the thing is made of nearly indestructible titanium? The nearly indestructible titanium is held together with plastic hinges.If we\u0027d been relying solely on the one-year warranty, we would have been screwed.","Now my warranty is up, same problem...","Who would have thought that it would die twice in such a short period of time (15 Months).One might assume that my situation was a fluke but consult the discussion boards on the Apple Support website and you will be suprised at the amount of people with laptops just like mine encountering the same frustrations.Overall both times I dealt with their service department I encountered less than helpful if not a somewhat abrupt employees.I reccomend if you can\u0027t stand not being hip and have to have the Apple product invest the extra $300 in their warranty program (hmmm...there goes the great deal) and plan on spending LOTS of time on the phone with unsympathetic Apple \"Care\" workers.","Then it suddenly died in 3/2007.Toshiba referred me to the nearest authorized service center for an out-of-warranty repair.","So far, in three months I have had two logic board replacements, screen defects, and now a slot-loading DVD drive defect which Apple refuses to repair under warranty.","Service: Applecare warranty and service/supportSo there it is.","Then, what seemed to be no more than 24 hours after my warranty expired, my memory slots go bad.","Returned the notebook for repair, even though it was \"supposably\" still under warranty, was a herculean feat.","Do get the extended warranty.","I called HP who initially refused to repair it under warranty.","It finally broke for good, right after the warranty expired! I think it\u0027s a recurring problem with this model.","So if you buy Toshiba get that extended warranty.","You may also want to consider purchasing the AppleCare extended warranty to extend Apple\u0027s 90 days telephone technical support/1 year parts and labor service to 3 years telephone technical support/parts and labor service.","Finally, I would mention that the company handled the fiasco with the above-mentioned overheating laptops rather poorly: fixes under warranty were available, but no blame was admitted and of course once the warranties are up, those machines will likely become paperweights.","They shipped it to Compaq for repair cause they did not have a harddrive on site plus since it was still under warranty it was best to sent to them.","I have experienced a hot power supply and have been trying to get it replaced, since the unit is under a one year company warranty (always, always buy the extended b/c I have a feeling that I\u0027ll have to wait for that to begin to get this issue resolved) and Averatec refuses to help out.","For me the extra cost was worth it for the occasional need to burn large files to DVD when away from my primary machine, YMMV.As with all laptops, these machines are more prone to failure than the desktop hardware, and will be more costly to fix should they break, so I would highly recommend purchasing Applecare for this product for the additional 2 years of hardware warranty it provides.","Thats right, ONE DAY TURN AROUND.Yes, Apple warranty does not cover cases where you break your computer yourself but what warranty does? Did that reviewer think he should be able to to drive his car over his computer and then have it fixed for free?Apples stores are now available all over the U.S.","These parts are also available for less on web auction sites but be aware of the difference between a genuine Sony part and a generic part \"made to fit\" that might affect your warranty.Sony\u0027s web site has extensive information on the computer (including the operating manual), warranties, parts, etc. and can be read by potential buyers.In summary, based on many years of computer experience, I would NOT recommend the Sony as one\u0027s only computer.","Sony insisted to charge \u003e$250 to replace it because the warranty was just for one year.If you check Internet, you will find low quality fan is wide spread problem in Sony laptops.Be aware: Sony sells such low quality product at high price and then makes another round of profit by repairing it.","Even with its warranty, HP wouldn\u0027t repair it.I\u0027ve switched to IBM and will never look back! What a difference! Seller did not respond to my request to cancel my order and shipped it anyway two days after the order was placed.","The only authorized repair is to replace the ENTIRE mother board (some $700 is out of warranty).If you buy one, make sure you get an extended warranty for any of this line of PCs -- and be prepare to have it in repair for 2 weeks a year (and be prepared for it).","My problem with this Acer Laptop is that the screen suddenly burned out after about 1000-1200 hours of use - slighly beyond the one year warranty - In ten years of computer use I have never had a screen burn out.","Less than a year old,and Toshiba won\u0027t replace it.I spent a total of 2 hours trying to speak with a customer support person,and when I finally got one on the phone,she was the rudest person I\u0027ve ever dealt with.Toshiba flat out refuses to honor their warranty.","About three weeks after my warranty ran out, my wireless stopped working.","i will continue doing business with this company.they stand behind their warranty and products.","Said the only thing they can do is to send back the broken laptop.Note that I have to pay shipping to them, so I lost money on each failure and they won\u0027t extend my warranty, so it could run out while I wait for them to repair it.","I have had 2 Acers quit in the last year and a half, with Acer refusing to warranty either one.","Being a lawyer and upon deeper reflection of my experience with it and belief that I could not have been the only one with such a glitchy machine (especially in the light of it being a 20-plus pound paperweight at present due to being fatally inoperable since February of 2007), along with Toshiba \"volunteering\" to extend the warranty for a second year (and currently proffering interactive tech support for Qosmio owners previously unobtainable during 2005 to present), I began to do some research.","I send it for repair and it takes them 2 months to fix it and thus my warranty expires.","I called them up, gave them my phone number, and they pulled up the warranty.","But the hardware is delicate.The hard drive failed completely 1 week after the 1 year warranty.","I would get the extended warranty or change compatible digital camera and laptop systems before I got another Sony or VAIO.","Sony took back the laptop and replaced the motherboard for free as it was under warranty.","The hard drive on my 680 did crash shortly after buying it, but close to the warranty expiring.","It supports the \u0027two-finger clicks\u0027 to simulate a two-button mouse and to implement scrolling, but I havn\u0027t much used it, opting for a small two-button mouse instead (purchased separately, and not from Apple).There are some other things that come with the MacBook, most notably the built-in iSight (which can\u0027t be physically disabled short of voiding your warranty), and a tiny remote.","They say that you have a one year warranty but if you do not have all of your paperwork they will try to void your warranty even though they have records of everything.","I was sold on the great screen, but have had problems ever since.A warranty is getting me a new hard drive, and the customer service person I spoke to said that Sony has had major issues with faulty hard drives.The Sony software that they load on top of the operating system slows it down and cuts your space.","I asked tech support if I could send it via UPS as it was still under warranty.","If you are like me and like to format your laptop as soon as you get it, you will need to know that you aren\u0027t going to be able to do this (at least easily) with this one.I do wish the warranty was longer than a year, but every other laptop I have looked at seems to have the same.Love this baby! There are things that make you say \u0026quot;cool!\u0026quot; Then there are things that make your jaw drop ever so slightly.This was not the case.","4 individuals (one brain dead, one total indifferent, one telling my that my year warranty did not include the hard drive and one that disconnected me,) the last tech told me to send it back and it would be two weeks before I would get the machine back.","THEIR DEALER \"BEST BUY\" ARE ANOTHER BUNCH OF JOKERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING UNLESS I PAY 89 $ PLUS I NEED TO BUY SERVICE PLAN OR EXTENDED WARRANTY PLAN.SONY VAIO- MADE IN CHINA REALLY SUCKS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS FULL OF UNPROFESSIONAL JERKS.","Low and behold 4 months later (30 days after the warranty for the repair) the logic board failed AGAIN! Being that my computer is so young and that it had been \"repaired\" a short four months prior I called Apple to see what options I had.","I barely used it the first year b/c I was still using my old

commercial:\"every time i turn on my MacBook, it definitely turns me on!\" :o)it runs like a dream..., (i\u0027ve had a Mac performa 5200, fujitsu i-4xxx, fujitsu N-3010, and fujitsu-6231 laptops and this MacBook has treated me the best!)it\u0027s light, fast, dependable, syncs well with my Treo 755p, runs my school apps perfectly...the ONLY real setback is that it is an intel-Mac and as such, i cannot run any of my older Mac OS-9/classic apps.","A drop for one of these means broken screen unless you take precautions like this.c) though I hate warranty packages from the retailer, this is one situation where such a warranty might be worth while.","I also purchased the extended warranty, but it hasn\u0027t helped much.","Fortunately manuals can be downloaded from HP/Compaq.Amazon indicates it is covered by a 90-day warranty.","It\u0027s a few months out of warranty now.","Still under factory warranty, I sent it in to Hp, but despite numerous phonecalls, no one even got back to me to give me a time estimate for its return for over two and a half weeks.","Three years, three major problems:1) Within a year after purchase, it would boot to the \"sony\" screen then freeze to a black screen, the processor not starting.Solution: Luckily this happened before my year-long warranty was up and was able to have it fixed.","This produce comes with a one year warranty that covers problems like this however, and it was very easy to get in touch with the service representatives.","I was asked at the time of purchase if I wanted to extend the Warranty.","Makes more sense for me to have a couple of these used \"Rolls\" that were well cared for and came with a warranty than a slick fast one that does tricks and causes headaches.Probably in a class with a couple of cars.. a classic and much loved machine.Never have any trouble.","I was provided a Vista version of the TXN25N when my T350P (XP Pro) laptop was broken during repair by the vendor\u0027s technical support and had to be replaced as part of my extended warranty.","Excellent Screen, powerful battery, three year warranty, sturdy construction and relative light weight make this a great choice for the frequent business

free, it was still under the 3-year warranty), but the old one fixed itself as soon as the replacement arrived and has been working now for a few years since.The left 25% of the space bar don\u0027t produce a space when pressed --- started happening after around three years.The left button on the lower mouse controls stopped working --- started happening after four years.I\u0027ve been using a Macbook Pro for work, and every time I open the T41 now, it\u0027s such a relief to be able to tilt the screen as far back as I want.","I reported the matter to HP the next day and they agreed to collect the unit for warranty repair.","Adding insult to injury I attempted to purchase extended warranty (since there are known problems) and Toshiba refuses to sell it because extended warranty is only available in the first 6 months of service.","HP Pavilion DV2210US 14.1\" Entertainment Laptop (AMD Turion Processor TL-52, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)is

should have bought the extended warranty since \"even Mercedes can have problems with them...\"","Not that easy to put back in place and almost had to void my warranty by removing a sticker to get it back in place.Then 3 months later the thing dies.","So even more cash outlay as the warranty had expired.6)My 2nd laptop (Acer) with the exact same specs as this sony (except the hard disk size) is infinitely times faster eventhough it cost me almost a 1/3 of the sony price!

I wound up taking the unit to a authorized HP service center - CompUSA - and they were able to get the unit fixed.","I have the 4 year on site warranty.","Toshiba spares department were so weary and slow (under the warranty) that I just bought the parts myself and had them fitted.Price of parts and fitting was very reasonable and I would not justify anyone sensible paying out for extended warranty from retailer.","Much like the posts herein, I found alot of customers having dissatisfaction with the unit, as well as there being a few mentions of there existing either a quiet recall or buyback by Toshiba albeit through the possession of owners with extended warranties with retailers that sold the unit and extended warranties, I make the following request:I would kindly appreciate any and all information that anyone possesses concerning how their Qosmio G15-AV501 was either repurchased, traded-out, or replaced by Toshiba (or by any other source) so that I can further investigate any potential resource for recourse with Toshiba that is available concerning it selling what has become my $2,750.00 \"Qosmio Paperweight\" before resorting to the alternative potential of initiating litgation against Toshiba over it.Do note that I am more than happy to share the cause of my dissatisfaction upon mere request to do so (or confidentially exchange information in kind for information/assistance requested).","i\u0027m very happy! It was broken since day one and HP never made the warranty valid.","Now it about 6 months later and the warranty has expired and I\u0027m having the same problems.","The next few months were spent trying to track the thing down, and yesterday, when I took it to two separate Apple stores who told me that, whether it was under warranty or not, Apple would not fix the hinge under it as they classed it as \"user damage\".","CompUSA charged $500 for extended warranty but then say sorry, they don\u0027t cover plastic parts and any kind of damage.","Some of these reviewers need to educate themselves before taking action.The reviewer who cleaned their system before upgrading to Windows XP professional: why not use the upgrade version of XP professional instead? The result is the same and costs less.As far as the drivers for the system, all the orignal drivers are readily available for download on Sony\u0027s support website.Look and learn!!! Some things to note about the description that Amazon has provided for this laptop: this model (2378FZU - Ibm\u0027s designation for this notebook) has a 15\" screen, not a 14.1\"; cdrw rewrite speed is 24x, not 10x; it has one-year manufacturer\u0027s warranty, not a three-year; the wifi only works with b and g networks, not a networks; and to clarify, this model does not have the built-in fingerprint reader.","The warranty was used up.","I own an HP dv2120 laptop, but the defects are in all versions of the dv2000 series.Just after owning this for a little over two years (and the manufacturer warranty just expired), its poorly designed hardware started to defect:- It takes many attempts turning my laptop on and off before before it will actually POST; usually it takes me about 10 to 15 tries before i get lucky and it boots.","Six months after the one year warranty expired, the screen began to form thin lines.","$880 bucks for 1 year extended warranty...????? And they wonder why they are losing marketshare to Dell (hate Dell product, but their Customer Service is the aces) - So maybe CPQ/HP will wake up some day and take notice of those kicking their butts before they file BK or get bought up by IBM or Dell...","I am lucky that all these problems happened while it is still under warranty.","It finally died one month after the 1 year warranty had ended.","It crashed under warranty but I waited to get help from Sony; you guessed it.","They do not have the proper cost benefit in my opinion.4) No IR port! I don\u0027t nee this, but I\u0027m sure others might (and I may need it in the future).5) Sucker is big compared to the newer laptops out there, although it still falls in the extremely portable category.6) VERY weak warranty.","Thanks to the Best Buy extended warranty, this hasn\u0027t been a financial burden.","My IBM built T40 was just inside the 3 year warranty when the motherboard cracked (a design weakness common to all the T40 series Thinkpads) and that was the only service call I had in the 4 years I used the machine.","I took it to the Genius bar 1 week before the warranty ran out and they fixed it.","I realize doors can easily break off, but maybe a molded rubber strip would have (a) been better-looking, and (b) kept dust, dirt, and lint out.- Apple should take a cue from the automobile industry and its included standard 3 year/50,000-miles warranties.","25 percent of the time it won\u0027t recognize something in there, and is very finicky about CDs, often developing playback issues (or just complete failure) the longer the time you are accessing the CD.Now, cut to a year later - conveniently, right at the end of my warranty - and the laptop is randomly shutting down whenever it feels like it (presumably the unit is overheating due to a broken fan or something along those lines).","I definitely recommend buying a three year extended warranty.","I am filing a claim with my credit card company to see if their extended warranty will cover the cost.Customer service.","The RMA status on the website has been broken for the entire month ordeal, and the company takes on average a week and a half to return a phone call requesting warranty status and tracking numbers.","For nearly six weeks, I have been deprived of the effective use of a computer ,while the warranty period on anything else that might go wrong is perhaps conveniently running for Averatec!The company has a product that almost sells itself.","It runs too hot to put on your lap, shuts down 1-2 times a day (hard freeze), CD/DVD player too noisy to comfortably watch DVDs, AC connector broken twice, have had to pay $600 in repairs, HP wouldn\u0027t honor warranty.","I called Sony about this, and their only solution was for me to send it in for warranty service (which would take two weeks minimum) and get it replaced.","But I would suggest a extended warranty for anyone who purchases it.","Get the 3 year warranty if you plan on keeping this laptop for more than year.","Warranty expired, no repairs unless I was willing to fork out hundreds of dollars.","The people that handle the extended warranty (bought through the official SonyStyle website) are a pain in the a**.","The Macbook broke down (or was inadvertly damaged), which I thought would be a simple matter to diagnose, relate to the warranty, and correct...even if not covered by the warranty.","I called HP and was told that it was out of warranty but the Rep was knowledgeable enough to see notes that this particular model had system board issues and the warranty was extended for a year.HP sent me a call tag for free and had my laptop repaired with a week.","Dell was reputed to have outstanding service, so I paid about $300 just for an extra long extended warranty.","They told me that the warranty didn\u0027t cover that, and I would have to pay them $500.00 if I wanted it fixed.","They said that this type of damage is not covered under the 1 year warranty.","The key is to get a really good (if somewhat expensive) extended warranty plan that will cover everything, so that you can use this baby and sleep well at night knowing you\u0027re covered for all sorts of unforeseen problems.","Currently I have to use a PC Card wirless and the antenna keeps banging into everything.* Can\u0027t expand to 1 GB ( Ithink that this is a limitation of the Pentium 4M chipset* Cannot upgrade the \u0027quick ship\u0027 GRX models to the 3 year warranty (The built to order GRX models sold through Sony have the 3 year warranty option).","Luckily, it was still under warranty both times we\u0027ve had to repair it, but I would be nervous to purchase one as a personal computer at home.","Got to laugh at Dell (they SUCK!, Service is atrocious/outrageous responses..please don\u0027t purchase the \"extended warranty\" from them...they will not honor it, DELL products are middle of the road, although cheap...and that sums up what you get....cheap).","I\u0027ve got the extended warranty, so I\u0027m sure that it will be fixed.If you\u0027re doing processor-intensive tasks, and need a machine that can be carried from workplace to workplace, and you don\u0027t necessarily need to be working from your battery all the time, I\u0027d highly recommend this machine.","Please ask around before you purchase this computer because unbeknownst to me Compaq (now HP) has apparently tried to reduce costs on notebooks and it shows!I will give it 2 stars because luckily it crashed within its warranty (unluckily 2 weeks before exams!) and the tech support people were helpful and I can send it for repairs for free.","Read the fine print in the extended warranty; this company loves to use refurbished parts to fix their computers.","Why would a company want to ruin their reputation and not honor their warranty? I purchased this computer in July, and on December 5th the hard drive broke.","Excellent warranty for the price.Loaded softwareThe minor Office Works or whatever it is comes loaded.","(I just want to comment that I wonder how long Circuit City would last with the sales kids knowing little about the products they are selling but pretend to know a lot, and when you refused to buy additional warranty their face just turned unfriendly.","Essentially a worthless computer.I had an extended warranty through Circuit City but they were bankrupt.","There is no guidance from Sony regarding why the drive is set up this way.I elected to purchase the Sony 4GB Memory Stick, the 2-yr warranty and the Sony external FireWire DVD/CD drive as additional storage.","I read from the warranty where software support was 90 days with registration.","Hp gave me the run around about fixing it, even though I was still in warranty.","My laptop had broken down within the one-year warranty period.I was not getting any video output.","Now yet once again it has disappeared but its no longer under the extended warranty and they want $200 to replace it.","The warranty is great though for a year so they will replace it free if it is faulty.I would definately get the memory upgrade.","Next inquire as to the extent of the warranty.","Mine was a refurbished model, so no warranty there, but my replacement will definately be this same computer.","Initially, it was fine but started to fail after the warranty ran out (of course).","The initial estimates for my repair job (now that the 1 year limited warranty has expired) is at least $700, and I am sure that it would be pushing $1500 by the time they are done.","The motherboard on this machine, which has been sparingly used since it was purchased in October 2002, failed in November 2003, a date approximately one month after the expiration of the manufacturer\u0027s warranty.","(Now that my Toshiba one year warranty is up, lets pray nothing goes wrong...lol...)","I sent my Toshiba Satellite to the company for warranty service and never got it back and the company has ignored all requests, including those by the Better Business Bureau.","Some months after I got it (and towards the end of the limited warranty), I started getting a garbled screen that Sony was quite reluctant to fix.","She paid about $1800 [including about $300 for maximum warranty].","The second time, HP said the product was out of the extended warranty period.","When the computer was a week out of warranty, my first power cord failed.","Customer service was very good and efficient -- Toshiba has warranty contracts with UPS Stores to pack \u0026 ship them back at their expense, so it was an easy process.","Naturally, by the time I realized this, the warranty was out.","It has yet to be explained to me WHY the COMPUTER STOPPED WORKING IN THE 1st place.That was covered under warranty and my computer is now back 2 weeks later up and running.","The machine is under warranty but the IBM support says it happened because of the abuse.","I have had to replace it twice, not a problem since it is under warranty, but when the warranty runs out, I will have to spend around $500 for when the screen starts to go dim on one side again.","Complete extended warranties with accidental damage coverage offered by computer retailers for about the same price were only 2 years vs. Gateway\u0027s 3.The Gateway is much sleeker, and cleaner looking with its monotone metallic case and integrated speakers.I realize that most of my points are aesthetic, but the hardware is almost identical, and performance should be very comparable.","Everything else has worked well, and I especially appreciate the HDMI output and Blu-Ray writer.So, if you purchase this unit, get the extended warranty, because there is a very good chance you will have a failure of the GPU within two years.","I love it! I had a Toshiba Satellite Notebook and experienced great warranty service.","This time Toshiba told me the computer was out of warranty so it was my problem.","I have to constantly explain why I need a repair, for example, for some reason the VAIO logo on top of the lid burned through to my screen, even with a screensaver functioning; however, it is not replaceable under warranty from wear and tear but must be accidentaly dropped.","I actually picked the Toshiba up through my BB warranty.","I called up tech support and they gave me a shock saying my warranty doesn\u0027t cover it and it can not be repaired!!!

But now you have vista to take it\u0027s place.So I decided to go ahead after years of thinking and I bought this gateway and it is by far the best looking and the best working one I have seen today.I work on computers and I would normally by a dell are a IBM around 5 years of age because they last forever.They new model computers I don\u0027t care what model they are will last you for a year tops if you use them enough.As you can see this laptop is still around and still working! Get it ! How many can say that when they go to besy buy and buy a laptop new! How many times did you go back and if your warranty was up you were screwed! Its a great laptop with a full keyboard I mean a full keyboard like you have on a desktop.Not squeezed together like the newer model laptops! All kind of buttons for your every need.I give this laptop rave reviews and its still going and count the years when it first came out and then count the years of the newer model laptop you have and does it still work.For this laptop to still work after 8 years I am please with no problems so how about that! Cant say that for many laptops now a days.You get 1 year with all that junk in it and it will last 1 year.Now I ask you whats better a laptop working for a long time are a suped up one that last a year.I got my money worth plus and this laptop still works without a hitch.Upgraded to 2gb of memory and 100gb hardrive.And now I can add up to 500 gigs with the new IDE PATA DRIVES.Man I have no complaints take it from me it will last you for ever!

Poor craftsmanship all-around)- The keys occaisionally popped off (fixable but annoying)- The disc drive stopped working...","Per the Sony warranty, my only option is to repeatedly send it in to the repair center that so far has been unable to detect the problem - much less fix it.","By which I mean that their products are very attractive-looking but also very overpriced, overhyped, and totally dependent saleswise on the huge (and expensively maintained) brand-name recognition.However to be fair, Sony unlike Bose does at least publish full specs on all of its computers, where Bose doesn\u0027t even tell you how many watts per channel its audio stuff is! And Sony isn\u0027t quite THAT bad for computers, just notoriously unreliable.My wife was given one of these computers at work and it has been constantly in the shop!I have worked in IT for over 20 years and the machines that we spend the most time repairing are Sony VAIOs and Compaqs/HPs.My advice is, if you\u0027re on a budget go with Dell and if you have more money to spend buy a Toshiba or IBM.","I a going on y third repair.","Apple has issued a repair extension program to help owners deal with this.","I\u0027ve sent in the notebook twice now to be repaired only to recieve it a week later.","I have yet needed to take it in for repairs, but I have needed to perform a repair to it by myself.","This time HP says it will take me 265$ to repair it.Had i been smart enough to look this up before buying, I would have never bought this notebook.","Then it finally quit working and I sent it out for repair.","Free 2-day mail to the repair center and free 2-day return mail to my residence meant I had a new motherboard within 8 days total (including a weekend) at no cost to me.","I called Toshiba about my defective USB ports, they told me they would send me a box to have my laptop repaired in, then they didnt send anything.","They returned it to me and it worked fine until the AC adpater suffered a short circut and died two months after I had gotten my screen fixed.Since then I have had the screen replaced 4 times and DVD/CD drive replaced twice, and my touch pad repaired, and the mother board repaired three times, and the AC adapter replaced seven times and I am still have problems with this computer.This computer was purchased from Circuit City.","The motherboard failed and is costing me around $400 to diagnose and repair.","Customer service is great: if you don\u0027t mind spending 12 HOURS on the phone before getting authorization to send them the computer for repair.","Since the hard drive broke after 12 months of purchase, even by a few weeks, it was out of warranty and I was charged for a new hard drive and repair work.At the time of writing, the hard drive (replaced by Sony at their California repair station) has broke AGAIN.","Just this morning, I had to turn the computer on and off nearly 50 times before it finally turned the screen on.HP has had problems with this model (especially with the BIOS... if you search HP\u0027s web site, this model is eligible for a free repair), but if you\u0027re like me and off of the warranty, you are out of luck.","We sent it in for warranty repair in August 2006 and it was returned like new, with a new battery and power cord.Now, in March 2007, the power cord is falling out, battery life is very short and the computer gets very hot, causing the fan to run on high.HP will not repair the computer under warranty in the 15th month, even though they repaired the same problem six months ago.I have another HP laptop (dv5000) which had a serious conflict with an HP All In One.","I\u0027ve been told that I can\u0027t get my money back on this overpriced paperweight because it\u0027s a repair warrantee, not a refund warrantee.","Luckily it happened so soon, that my system is still well under warranty, but it\u0027s due to be repaired by replacing with a similar, faulty designed board.","My hard disk was very noisy and I had to send it for repair, they replaced my hardware with refurbished parts and sent it back.","Sony made it easy to keep track of the progress of the repair online.","Instead of being apologetic, they attempted to charge me to replace it (never mind that I purchased an extended warranty and had owned the computer for less than a month!) and insisted that I give them a credit card number to \u0027secure the repair, in case the warranty wasn\u0027t valid.\u0027","We contact Toshiba - they refer us to a local firm that does their repairs for the entire South Texas region.","It\u0027s a hassle any way you cut it: Averatec repairs are also reputed to take a long time, with no effort to explain delays on simple repairs (like replacing a CD/DVD unit).Anyone thinking of buying Averatec should first visit the unofficial support forums: http://www.averatecforums.com/Someone there recently posted a complicated fix for several problems; it involves downloading and installing three programs to take over power management of the computer.","Now For 1,200 (the price when I purchased this junk) one would think Sony could afford to send a Repair Disc, and a CD with the standard software they installed at the factory.","This means that a single drop of water spilled on the keyboard can ruin it, resulting in the need for a very costly repair.","So I sent it in direct to toshiba for repair.","I brought it to the TOSHIBA repair center and after a week of inspection, they said there wasn\u0027t any problem.","So I sent it for repair just before the warranty expired.","We contact Toshiba - they refer us to a local firm that does their repairs for the entire South Texas region.","I was told HP would need to get in back for repair.","I called tech support and they sent out a box for repair pickup and told me the turnaround would be 3-5 days.","$670 total.* Even though they were giving away their own profit, they told me that they thought it would be unethical to recommend that I repair it.The service center appealed to their Toshiba rep.","I have not once taken it in for a tune-up, repair, inspection, ect.The only minor hindrances are as follows:The keyboard doesn\u0027t light up which makes typing in the dark difficult.For some reason my hard-drive is almost full so everytime I search for something in the search bar, it runs really slow.It doesn\u0027t use an IBM processor so I guess you can say it is a true blood mac, which makes some programs incompatible.Now the good stuff:I actually think that if you consider it was made 5 years ago, it is a better computer than what apple makes now.","Dont buy Sony! Support honesty, dont buy Sony! sony sucks..i paid this laptop 1700 dolars and it s broken 3 times in a year..first time they fixed and it broken again with same problem but they want 700 dolars for repair...no audio no more playing dvd s ..i m tired of recovery ...stay away from sony...","so relatively happy at this point, I didn\u0027t get too annoyed by the fact that the thing came back with Swedish OS (I don\u0027t speak swedish, have never lived in sweden, I live in France and the laptop was repaired in the UK!) so I had to re-install my old OS with a dictionary at hand, download all missing updates, re-install every single piece of software etc. loads of work..until I later realised something quite devastating as i was inserting my XD-memory card into the 6in1 media card reader that I had grown to love: the card just slipped into the computer-not into a card reader but fell into the laptop completely! I had a closer look and realised that there was no media card reader anymore on the laptop.","Despite being in a neoprene rubber protective case, it was damaged so badly that repairing would cost the same as a new Macbook.So after some nagging, the insurance ponied up for a new Macbook rather than repairing the Pro.I bought the White 2.2GHz model but with custom RAM (2 GB) and hard drive (250 GB), plus AppleCare, via the Apple Educational store.First impressions:- battery life is astonishing.","I\u0027ve never had to send it for repairs, because Apple fixed minor problems with their updates as they occurred.","It\u0027s been at the repair shop (continuously) since April 7th.Why would you want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars, as I did, on a laptop that won\u0027t run on battery, that is too hot to hold in your lap, that suddenly turns off and loses all your data, and THEN, on TOP of that, after you have been patient and been without your new laptop for MONTHS, get all sorts of rude crap from their Customer Service (ha! what an oxymoron that is!)? Only after I used this computer did I realize that this is the worst decision I\u0027ve done-----1.You have no option for OS except XP, which is the poorest OS I\u0027ve used.","My laptop got sent back to depot for repairs for more than 8 times--each repair taking between 4 days to 3 weeks!Buyers beware!

Toshiba Customer Service is the worst I have ever encountered.","It is a bit on the heavy side, but I got used to it afeter a week or so.A+ I have been trying to get this computer repaired for 2 months now.","Backed up all data and contacted Sony about repair.","If they tell you to send the computer, do it and they\u0027ll repair it for free.The only downside to this computer that I found is that the processor runs at a very low speed, even when not idle or hibernating.","Their warranty does NOT guarantee a computer that will EVER work -- only endless repair attempts.","When the unit finally came back, it was damaged (nasty scratches on top \u0026 bottom) and it had to go back for another repair to get the external casing replaced.","(CompUSA, for example, offers one for an additional $350)The cost of repair is about $750, even if it occurs in the first couple of months.I do NOT recommend this product.","I won\u0027t go over the minute details, but basically it was in for repairs at least 5-6 times to replace the battery, hard drive, random reboot issue, discoloration on the plastic, SuperDrive, etc.The last issue I had was just two days ago.","It took three months for Averatec to deliver most of the required parts to the authorized repair facility, and a full five and a half months for the motherboard to arrive.","not only is sony the worst customer support on the planet, unless you are japanese, they suck at laptops4 days old my wireless lan has failed and the answer I got from the customer support is to buy a pcmcia wireless adapter or plug in a 10BT cable, if I want to get the wirelss repaired it will take 8 to 10 weeks.","i had to get it repaired from sony for $800 ( had to do it, no other choice, cant thorw a $2000 laptop.all set, and the lcd breaks again within 30 days..","The second attempt to repair was even worse - this time they tried to replace the hard drives AND the system memory.","But here is my biggest gripe: the computer just came back from repair.","What really perturbed me was that Averatec will not let you return the unit to the place of purchase but require you to return the unit via mail to their repair facility in Silicon Valley.","Once you\u0027re out of warranty, too bad sucker!

repair it and return it (they indicated it would take at least 2 weeks).","Now im not saying this is a bad laptop but you can do better.Lets start looking at whats bad about this lap topone its really

been in repair 6 time..I tryed to get HP to replace with a new notebook but there not up to doing so.I dont recommend this notebook or any other product from HP.this is my first and last HP product I had this notebook for a few months, having switched from the PC to the Mac platform.","Since the repair shop is close to my place, I chose to take it to the repair shop.","Finally the order was in the system and I was able to get a box to send the computer to the repair center a week later from the first breakdown.I got my computer from the repair center after few days, but it broke down again.","I sent it, at their expense for repair and got it back in about 4 days.","Estimated repairs were quoted at +$800 which nowadays can buy a Centrino Duo notebook (New).","I have a 700Z Custom built that

model laptop.PLEASE DONT BUY anything from averatec.The laptops monitor had a problem only after a week i bought.The customer service is VERY VERY bad.They take 2 weeks time to repair/replace anything.This is during the warranty period(1 yr).Thereafter,if anything goes wrong you have to ship it back to them,as they dont sell any of their parts outside.Now, this time they took 4 weeks time to repair.Compare this with DELL/MAC.its a 3 days reponse time.","This thing is a ticking timebomb for anyone who needed information stored on the machine.I am told that an authorized Toshiba dealer will make the necessary repairs for free.","The cost of repairing the power jack was quoted $400 from HP.","The repair shop failed to recognize that the second system was mine and did not follow through with repairs even when all the proper paperwork was channeled through support on the phone.7.","I had to pay the shipping fee plus more than $250 for each computer to be repaired.","They refused to replace the laptop, and now it finally died on me and Sony wants to charge me $700 to have it repaired again.","Then, there was a repair needed, so I sent it back to Sony, who fixed the machine, wiped out my hard drive, and sent it back, guess what, reloaded with all of the crap.","I thought I was also buying Toshiba reliability, that was a joke.Of the six weeks I have had it the last four weeks it has been in for repair.","Excellent PurchasePro- Great battery life (we\u0027ve gotten 7-8 house using wireless and www/word/emailPretty sturdy, not as much as my clamshell ibook

experience with them.Personally I prefer a Toshiba Tecra S1, it has 32MB of dedicated video memory on a Radeon ATI card whereas this one has shared video memeory, and tons of different connections and expandability options.But still way better than some crappy HP or Compaq or Sony, my IT friends all report that those have the most repairs by far.Hint: buy extra memory from Dell, it\u0027s a snap to

repair every couple of weeks.","VERY poor repair service.","It came back again, and then the hard drive crashed within 1 day - hah! Not sure what the repair people are doing, but they seem to do more harm than good.","After contacting HP support with no success I received an email from them offering free repair since there is a known problem with this model.","So what I got from repair was worse than what I sent in.It\u0027s really a shame.","I don\u0027t know why so many people are dependent onothers to help them repair things in this day and age.","Not everyone needs a laptop this small, but for it\u0027s size it is incredibly feature packed and robust.I have had problems - My SD card reader doesn\u0027t work any more and I can\u0027t get the case open to check the connection or replace the part (Sony repair is out of the question - I can\u0027t survive long enough without the machine).Other than that it has been superb.","Need to buy Apple\u0027s extended warranty because very few people can open or repair it.","I had nothing but problems with my Sony - first the lcd display backlight burned out just a month after the warranty expired, and I had to pay $450 to repair it.","It went 4 times to the repair center indicaed by Toshiba and they were not able to fix the problem (it is under warranty).","I brought it to an authorized Toshiba repair center.","While my HP machines have needed repairs, I never had problems with faulty repair work, and physical damage to the machine while it was being repaired.","They claim that their warranty policy only covers the repair of the original computer.","I sent it to the repair facility.","in order to get repaired, must 1] take to an \"authorized service center\" in the states or 2] they will send you a box you can ship it to them, but must pay $24 for the box. and they only partnered UPS. no UPS in Iraq and nearest repair shop in Kuwait,but not covered under \"international warranty.\"know of several other service members with this type of notebook that have had display or battery problems and now out of $1Kguaranteed to have problems if you buy this.","i think, if you own a toshiba and live in America, AMERICANS SHOULD HELP YOU!!

Don\u0027t make the same mistake I did; purchased a PowerBook Notebook 17\" less than 6 months ago and it has spent a month, on and off total, being \"repaired\" for all kinds of issues.","After contacting tech support (which is free for the first year) and unsuccessfully trying to re-format my hard drive with the included Restore Discs, I finally had to ship it off to Compaq to get it repaired (also free for the first year).","My local repairman tells me it looks like a major repair that will require replacing the whole screen, since it\u0027s not the actual hinges, but the hinge attachment points that have snapped.","Within one year, it went to the repair shop 3 separate times.","The repair shop failed to recognize that the 705us system was mine and did not follow through with repairs even when all the proper paperwork was channeled through support on the phone.5.","It\u0027s 20 percent faster than the model it replaces and 20 percent cheaper, with a hundred-buck price cut and wireless networking included.The iBook features a brilliant, small screen, 4+hour battery, 4.9 pounds, an array of fast ports, industry-leading styling and the best repair record in the industry, according to Consumer Reports.","Right out of the box it malfunctioned so they offered to repair it.","Now, whatever you tell the agent will not be read by the next one, so the repair people will just operate on their own.","One great thing this computer does is run Windows using software called Parallels.I had to send the computer back for repair because of the trackpad button requiring being pushed very hard before clicks are recognized by computer.I had to send the computer back a second time because the DVD drive scratches CD and DVD\u0027s if the computer is moved when reading from optical drive.I had to send the computer back a third time because it would randomly shutdown and the optical drive was misaligned.","When I took the machine to a Toshiba-authorized repair center, they replaced the motherboard and keyboard, but put the (previously working) mousepad in upside down and never got it to work again.","I brought it to the repair shop and they said that it was defective.","I called customer support and they agreed to repair it although I had to ship it back to them at MY OWN EXPENSE.","Of course the Authorized Apple dealer can\u0027t make the repairs, and it has to be shipped to Apple itself to be looked at further.","For several weeks I heard nothing, despite checking the Averatec website for updates on the repair status.","I called Fujitsu and Fujitsu told me they have nothing to do with the repair shop!!! Fujitsu also said it was my responsibility to prove that the repair shop broke my hard drive even though I demonstrated to the repair guy that the computer was booted up properly as seen on the dim screen when I first dropped it off.I decided not to fix anything because I did not trust Fujitsu or the repair shop.","So far my iBook experience has been1)defective product2)attempt to charge for repair of product3)late diagnosis4)late repairIf you\u0027re thinking about getting a mac, get a powerbook.","I took the computer again to the Apple store to drop it off to be sent for repair, only to find out that to drop off a malfunctioning computer requires an appointment---and they specify the time.","In June 2005 it was returned to a authorized repair centre but returned with diminished performance.","BEWARE of this product,the screen damages easily and is not covered by sony\u0027s warranty-it will cost you up to $500 to have it repaired on top of the$2000 it cost originally.I am of course worried that this will happen again in the future andI continue to carry my Dell with me wherever I go.SONY HAS ANOTHER PROBLEM THE SIZE OF IT\"S BATTERY PROBLEM AND WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS SOON Beware.","Each time, HP has had to repair or replace the hard drive in the dv2310us.","My screen failed after six months and I returned the computer to Sony for repairs.","Soon after, I got a call from fremontek (handles Averatec warrenty and repairs) telling me that it\u0027s NOT covered, and I\u0027d have to pay $355 to get it back repaired, or about $60 just to get it back the way it was! I had already paid for shipping, so WTF! I had them send it back to the tech three times, each time explaining that the damage was due to a factory defect (no cushion pads, touchpad contact with LCD, etc...), but the warrenty clearly states that \"physical damage to the LCD\" is not covered, even though any damage due to a manufacturer\u0027s defect is...","Well, it\u0027s still broke and Lenovo has yet to send a tech to look at it; let alone the heavily promoted \"next day service repair.\"","So here I am with a brand new notebook that spent twice as much time in the repair shop than on my desk.","carried by another person, in bag , without any physical abuse.i am not sending it back for repair again ..","This is fortunate since I first called apple and they wanted me to send it in for a repair that was going to take 4-6 weeks to complete.","They arranged to send one from out of town.)It is quite natural for things to malfunction.... more so if they have been used and moved around like I use them.Sony thanks for a great machine and thanks for coming through with your Tech and Repair support.I am contemplating changing to a new laptop....","I took it into the the authorized repair shop.","Three repairs and the thing still overheated and itself burned out.","Last one was great, it lasted me good 2 years (which I would call the life span of most laptops), than I have to deal with repairs.","And we are still waiting for our notebook to be returned to us from its last repair after 4 weeks! We have left messages begging for help from customer support people, but they never have returned our calls.","The single-facility repair limitation is(was) the biggest problem with Sony.","If I had to re-mortgage for the cable imagine what I had to do for the HDD?(!!!) Of course the repair shop could only replace a 160GB with a 300GB.","I highly recommend if you purchase this or any other laptop, you buy some sort of repair plan.","After spending that much money, you can be certain I did not manhandle the computer; however, after speaking with tech support maybe I should throw the darn thing against the wall more often just to be able to get it repaired.","I got my iBook repaired within a week.","Only problem with the repair is that they lost my power cord, which they told me to send then asked me why i sent it when I complained that they didn\u0027t return it.","Called the warranty service who advised me to send it to the Toshiba depot for repair, as opposed to taking it to a local service center.","I have owned it less than a year, and the battery does not work, the power cord falls out all the time, a key has fallen off, and I have already had it sent off twice for repairs on the hard drive.","Like: \"how do I get this repaired\".","(I live in Great LA and the service center is in San Diego)I have no complaint on Sony service center, but 2 months after the repair, there are some symptoms that I will probably have the same problem soon.","Repair the cd/dvd system was like $300 dolars according with Sony.","That\u0027s when I started with the nightmare of HP Customer Service!After a significant process, HP finally agreed to \"repair\" the notebook, which took nearly a month.","I also told them that I have no children in my home nor does the computer leave the house.Then after about 2 hours I was told to take it to fed-ex and ship it to the Sony San Diego repair center.","I took it to a repair shop that confirmed that the CD drive was not working.","I had to send it to the repair center for the third time.","I thought it was only my machine at first, but I\u0027ve found out that the problem is common and that compaq offers a heat sink repair kit that doesn\u0027t really work either...I recommend against buying one of these machines unless you have no other alternative or you get it for less than 100 bucks.","Only problem experienced; loose video cable (repaired free by Apple).Now i am just waiting for the G5 Ibook! This is a beautifully designed system.","When it arrived it looked OK, but the camera didn\u0027t work... and a week later nothing worked, every time I turned it on, I got the system setup message....I called Sony and told them all my problems, try to get it to a repair store, but they said they couldn\u0027t do anything for me, I has to sent back the laptop to Amazon...","I had my own business repairing and upgrading computers.","They told me to mail it back to them for repair.","When I phone back, they still don\u0027t know about the part, and claim that, by law, they have 30 days to do warranty repairs.","So, I sent it in for repair...","Within a short period of time, the electrical connection on both Satellite laptops had broken and we were advised the repair cost was higher than the cost of a new computer.","After going through the usual 8 people and being disconnected twice, I finally got to a service person (Alisha) who listened to my tale of woe.I explained that I felt that four months of attempted repairs was a reasonable length of time to give the company to fix the thing and asked what I needed to do to have a replacement sent to me.","I would get a error message saying I needed my cooling system repaired and then it would shut off.","This time I asked them to send it to a central repair depot instead of the local shop.","This turned out to be a small local repair shop that contracts with Toshiba and other companies.","Sony sent their techs twice to do an in-house repair job, and both times, it was a complete disaster.","My laptop was overheating so I sent it in to averatec to be repaired under warrenty.","If I had to pay for warranty repairs, I\u0027d be pretty steamed! It\u0027s now 2007 and it\u0027s been two years since I purchased this laptop.","The laptop started overheated within a year, and I had to send it in for repair repeatedly (3 times so far.)","Again, HP is refusing the repair, and we have gotten a quote of $800 to repair it.","The help line and repair service for our Sony Cybershot was excellent (we broke the LCD screen).7.","If you buy one of the higher-end models, say the one with the DVD drive, you may find that watching a DVD on this small screen is not exactly the cinematic dream that you find on the amazing Titanium Powerbook G4 (with its glorious ultrawide 15.3\" screen.)Enjoy! Almost a perfect laptop....I owned 4 IBM laptops prior to this Macbook Pro 15, 2.4GHz, 2GB Ram,160GB HD.I used my Thinkpad X series for 3 years and finally it is now experiencing random blue screen of death (due to faulty aged motherboard or memory modules), which I am reluctant to buy replacement parts or repair (old 1.8GHz Centrino).This is my second Mac (I bought an iMac 20\" one year ago and really love it).","To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that \u0027the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress\u0027.","I paid a lot of money for my Sony and I expected Sony to repair my computer without a fuss.That did not happen.","(Sony, did not have a repair center or technician in the city where I was.","I buy, sell, and repair computers for a living, so alot of laptops pass through my hands.","Sony now freely admits the cd recovery disk program included with the machine does not work, in fact has never worked, and they still want you to shell out 60 bucks for the cd recovery kit, which takes up to four weeks for delivery.The Keyboard on my unit arrived with the \u0027delete\u0027 key not working, and Sony told me that since I had purchased it mail order, I would have to send it to them for repair, and it would take three mothns MINIMUM to fix.","I took it to the Computer shop to get it repaired and were told that it would cost $140.00 to get it repaired.","The service center Toshiba told me to have it repaired at couldn\u0027t identify any specific problems.","Not their policy, I\u0027m told and they dispute the 30 days, because they\u0027re not counting the days at the local repair depot before I started calling them directly.","However, we have had no issues sending them back in for repair...usually new motherboards.","Very PRICEY repair! Sony Tech Support was great! Tech support sent me a box via overnight, I sent the unit in, and three days later I had it back! Since its return it has worked fine.","They explained that the \"next day service repair\" does not apply if they decide an \"out of stock\" part is required.","After 13 months of using this computer the motherboard died and as someone else already said, it costs over 400 dollars (if you are in the USA) to repair it.","I purchased this machine from Amazon when repairs to my 12\" Apple Powerbook (late 2003 model, 866 mhz) would have come within a couple hundred dollars of the cost of a new iBook.After using the iBook for the past month, I\u0027m satisfied with my decision to jettison the Powerbook.","Toshiba can no longer meet warranty requirements and must take parts from junked portables or return refurbished computers with a 90 day warranty that Toshiba knows they are not able to repair when they break.","I am still contemplating keeping it and getting it repaired or returning it.","What really bugs me is that whenever I call the support center the supposed \"expert\" has me go through repair steps I\u0027ve done several times before I call them for help.","Needless to say they did not send the detail.I sent the $1300+ laptop to an outside repair shop that replaced the motherboard for $300.","I did not bother to try to convinceApple to pay for the repair (I was not in United States) and had it repaired at my own expense.","It worked!! I never heard from the repair center again, but I did receive a notice that is was a pleasure repairing my Sony.","HP repair service does not give you a loaner laptop for the enormous amount of time they estimate for repair.I can\u0027t give it four stars because of reliabilty issues I\u0027ve had this laptop for almost four years so I know it\u0027s fairly outdated now, however, I just wanted to lay out what I\u0027ve experienced from Sony in general.","At first they wouldn\u0027t repair it because I was out of the warranty period, then they changed course and said it was a special recall item and that they would.","Getting it repaired took ten days after many, many phone calls to Apple to get me on an expedite list, because the hard drive was on back order!The guy at computer repair said it\u0027s been happening a lot with the MacBooks, that the hard drive is physically ruined.","once again I have to make back ups, send the thing back for repair, afterwards spend many long evenings re-installing everything, downloading updates, organising my stuff, putting back the days of music I had on my itunes etc... what a nightmare.I like the computer, but its not reliable and the service is beyond anything accpetable.","Sony\u0027s sole repair facility is in San Diego.","Buyer beware! Toshiba offers a dis-service! It has now gone into their repair centre for the second time for the same problem! Their customer services were totally uncaring that I had taken time off work and spent money (about $60) just to get the computer to them... problems they still haven\u0027t been able to sort out.","I returned it and they quickly repaired the CD drive and it\u0027s worked fine since.","I purchased this laptop as a temporary laptop while mine was in for repair, and as an eventual gift for a friend.","In that time my machine has had 2 system crashes, resulting in it spending the majority of the time either at the repair facility, in transit, or in the tedious process of reloading all of my files and software.","i got my laptop few days ago and its not touchscreenBeaware buyers !

waiting for a backordered replacement DVD/CD drive.","I wrote to Sony, arguing that such a major fault was unacceptable, and asked them to repair the product at their own expense.","They brake, they malfunction, the support is terrible, yes they are nice on the telephone and will send you a box just like IBM, but their tech department will return the machine to you with no corrections but a mere reinstalation of the OS.Anyone reading this, don\u0027t buy sonY, it stucks.My laptop is under warantee, I have had the product repaired twice, of course I have\u0027t been able to obtain an exchange machine.Please don\u0027t buy Sony if you cherish your time and money.","The repair technician recommended that I replace the motherboard and/or CPU, but was unable to fix it otherwise.I found this 66-page thread too late... but it\u0027s enough to keep me away from purchasing another Vaio to replace this broken one:http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/5449/?o\u003d0 The laptop is very light which makes it great for students or others who shlep their laptop a lot.","They shipped it to Compaq for repair cause they did not have a harddrive on site plus since it was still under warranty it was best to sent to them.","Firstly i didn\u0027t mention i needed a repair, and even if i did, for the price i bought this thing and the nonsense i got, i should be offered free after sales services for the life of this junk.","Sony insisted to charge \u003e$250 to replace it because the warranty was just for one year.If you check Internet, you will find low quality fan is wide spread problem in Sony laptops.Be aware: Sony sells such low quality product at high price and then makes another round of profit by repairing it.","Even with its warranty, HP wouldn\u0027t repair it.I\u0027ve switched to IBM and will never look back! What a difference! Seller did not respond to my request to cancel my order and shipped it anyway two days after the order was placed.","The only authorized repair is to replace the ENTIRE mother board (some $700 is out of warranty).If you buy one, make sure you get an extended warranty for any of this line of PCs -- and be prepare to have it in repair for 2 weeks a year (and be prepared for it).","HP has been in posession of it for about 1/3 of that time... and still has it for the exact same problem... the display died.To add insult to injury... the current repair is being delayed (until after my warantee runs out?) because of a back-order of the \"part required to repair it)... (oh geeh, could it be a design flaw??)They insist on trying to sell me an extended warantee (which WON\u0027T cover the display) every time I call to see when I\u0027ll get it back.","Said the only thing they can do is to send back the broken laptop.Note that I have to pay shipping to them, so I lost money on each failure and they won\u0027t extend my warranty, so it could run out while I wait for them to repair it.","We had a hard drive go down on Monday, called Apple Support on Tuesday and arranged a (free) pickup the next day, they came and picked up the computer on Wednesday late afternnoon, they returned the computer completely repaired first thing Friday morning (again with free delivery).","Mines died after a few months and had to be sent back to repairs.","( generally, apple just use refurbished parts to repair your computer) I\u0027m sure that the apple technician saw this keyboard problem before.","In that case, you have to resign yourself to returning the computer for repair -- and being without it for 2 to 3 weeks.All in all, then, after a year of owning the 3225, I feel as though I would probably have been better off paying the extra money for a Sony Vaio thin-and-light or maybe one of the sub-5-pound Dell laptops.However, I\u0027ll keep my eye on the Averatec unofficial forums to see how the newer thin-and-light models do.","Unless, of course, you pay 600 bucks to have it repaired, only to fail in another year.","I called tech support and they sent out a box for repair pickup and told me the turnaround would be 3-5 days.","I send it for repair and it takes them 2 months to fix it and thus my warranty expires.","I called tech support and they sent out a box for repair pickup and told me the turnaround would be 3-5 days.","I still have it nowadays but it needs repair - the LCD hinges broke because I kept using it on the subway and abused the monitor hinges pretty badly (always bending them back and forth, leaving them vulnerable to bumpy roads, train tracks, etc... when I rode transportation of any kind).The other issue is that around the same time the LCD issue was arising, my HD burnt out.","Not to mention, that I think this is very well calculated: instead of repairing, buy a new laptop - forced.In conclusion:1) it really doesn\u0027t matter what to buy because all the components are the SAME, CHINA made and eventually after max 2-3 years will brake.","Very disappointing! I sent the unit to Acer for repair and their turn around was good and they said they had to replace the motherboard.","Low and behold 4 months later (30 days after the warranty for the repair) the logic board failed AGAIN! Being that my computer is so young and that it had been \"repaired\" a short four months prior I called Apple to see what options I had.","The cd drive was not functioning and I sent to their repair facility and after 2 weeks it came back...with the same problem.","I barely used it the first year b/c I was still using my old Dell (the laptop this Toshiba was supposed to replace), and I had to send the Toshiba to the shop for hardrive repair just before the warranty expired.","Tons of ports on both sides for anything you want to plug in, and the remote is a nice touch too.Only problem I\u0027ve had is when the computer got knocked off my coffee table and landed on the charging port, had to send the computer off for repair, but HP support was very fast and helpful.","I haven\u0027t had to ask for repair yet, though.","Compaq\u0027s customer service does not know who their authorized repair centers are (I called their number listed on an email response which was not toll free, but they do have a toll free #)and they want you to mail it in to them for repair.My computer is 2 months old and the USB ports are so loose that I lose my internet connection and abilty to use my A drive.","If it does not work, I feel sorry for the trouble your will endure trying to get it repaired.","I was provided a Vista version of the TXN25N when my T350P (XP Pro) laptop was broken during repair by the vendor\u0027s technical support and had to be replaced as part of my extended warranty.","I have this laptop and I had to send it the repair facility TWICE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.","By the time I realized the DVD drive couldn\u0027t be used to record data, I had lots of data that needed to be backed up somehow before taking the unit in for repairs... without a working disk drive backups are very problematic.","So we took it to Comp USA, listed on the Apple website as an authorized Apple repair center.","I reported the matter to HP the next day and they agreed to collect the unit for warranty repair.","Our laptop has been at the repair facility for 3 (THREE) months!! We\u0027ve been on the phone with them weekly, and as of last week, daily.","The repair shop failed to recognize that the second system was mine and did not follow through with repairs even when all the proper paperwork was channeled through support on the phone.","I had a lot of headache, than I just write it off and got a new one (apple, which is an other story for an other time).Shortly,Good : Very good specifications, Nice design and quality of material, beutiful display, perfect sizeBad : Price (I think it is overpriced), poor customer service, weak batter lifeSony repair service is not really good, I have a lot to write about that but who is ?Have a good day, its definately an outstanding laptop.it\u0027s far from expensive for the specifications but there is a lot more than in there...i like it so much...its nicely designed for the portable user and I like the Ferrari design on it.","And then they have 10 business days to repair the useless piece of junk that your $1300 just turned into.I had many IBMs and DELLs, for periods of couple of years long.","I sent for Sony service, they repaired it in 10 days and sent me back.","Toshiba (and Apple) got the best rating for quality with the least amount of major repair problems.","GARBAGE... and less than one year old.After owning a Toshiba Satellite for less than 10 months, I have had to send it for repair 2 times.","Sent to Apple repair on April 4 and was informed 5 days later after I called that replacement wouldn\u0027t be available until end of April.","Oh, did I mention that I got 2 extra years of customer support and all-inclusive express repairs included in the price? If you need to know, I ordered it from HP but similar deals can be had from Dell and others.I am not here to promote any other notebook, but if you really want bang for your buck do your research and don\u0027t buy for looks, see what you can get for your hard-earned money from a PC company.","The Toshiba technican basically told me I have to bring my less than two months old laptop in for repair.","I run my online business, \u0026 my repair shop from my home.","I have owned Apple computers since 1990 or so, and I can truthfully say that I HAVE NEVER NEEDED TO GET ANY OF THEM REPAIRED OR SERVICED! Isn\u0027t that amazing! I\u0027ve never had a virus.","I have had no techical problems to this point so have no experience with Sony help desk or repairs.","Don\u0027t buy it, you will have problems as I had and Toshiba will keep suggesting that you bring notebook to a repair center until warranty expires....","They wanted almost $800 for the repair, but we settled for $577.","The first time, 3 months after I brought it, when I was on a trip to asia, the LCD broke without warning (cracked), since I was outside of the US, I had to pay for the repair on my own for over $600 to replace the LCD.","The repair, which should have been free, is going to cost $250.","During the 1st semester it had a problem but was repaired by techs that the college provided.","I\u0027ve just gotten my A215-S4767 back from a Toshiba authorized repair shop.","they tried unsuccessfully to restore it, but couldn\u0027t find the restore file! so within the 1st six mouths i had returned to the store twice for service and now they say i had to send it to you to have the files restored.After your repair.","To make my story really quick, Toshiba fails to repair this $3200 laptop.","Thank you! There is nowhere you can go for any repairing support in US.","I have had no hardware issues and only repairable software issues which I don\u0027t mind fixing myself.","After contacting the seller of Amazon, they instructed me to send it back for repair or replacement.","They were trying to charge me $795.00 to replace the LCD screen and would not do any repairs until I agreed to pay the $795.00 for the replacement of the LCD screen.","Sure enough repair facility, Fremontek in Fremont CA. charged me $355.00 dollars to repair and return.","Sony Support told me to take out the battery, hold down the power button, etc., but nothing worked so it was sent in for repair and I received it 4 working days later.","They had to replace the motherboard, a fact my repairs slip did not record-- I found that out talking to a Sony tech when I was hunting it down.","The turn-around time for repair was quite impressive.","on the first, the lcd screen failed after about three months.the repair department was horrible to deal with, and ultimately would not repair their product.do NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT buy an acer product unless you like dealing with failure.","The hysteria about older software not working with Vista seems overwrought; Corel Wordperfect 2002 worked at once, MS Office 2000 needed a repair install and produces some hiccups but now works.","I waited 53 days!!! until I\u0027ve got it back from the \u0026quot;Best Buy --\u0026gt; Compaq --\u0026gt; Best Buy\u0026quot; repair center.","It had to be shipped out to an Apple repair facility and I have been without it for almost two weeks.","I have a warranty but now I am without my camera for the holidays (4-6 weeks for repairs)I do NOT reccomend this or any sony product! i have always been an avid pc user, always going towards them.","When I called customer/ technical support all that they told me is that it is out of warranty and that I can send it to them and have it repaired at full price.","Instead they will prolong the repairs as long as they can till your warranty runs out, so your consumer right of having it repaired in a reasonable timeframe and manner.I am currently waiting for a response from Toshiba to my 6 pages long return receipt letter with detailed information and copies of repairs, since Toshiba\u0027s customer relations management denied some of the repairs done on this laptop by their certified repair center.We as customers are protected by the product\u0027s implied warranty and should enforce our rights.If Toshiba is not capable of resolving this issue to a satisfactory conclusion, than perhaps I should exercise my rights as a consumer.","I spent over $300 in repairs to try to fix the power problems.","After a week of waiting, my repaired laptop came back to me.","The power supply had come disconnected from the main system board and I had to pay 400 bucks to get it repaired.","The only good thing I can say about this laptop is that the warranty has covered the repairs.","The LCD has developed a problem which the local authorized repair center says is a manufacturing problem, but it is not covered under Apple Warranty.I just spent the past 1/2 hour talking with a snotty customer relationship manager \"Leela x40169\" who kept on telling me \"Apple doesn\u0027t have manufacturing problems\", when that didn\u0027t work, it was \"Amazon must have done something\", and then, I laughed at this one, \"You might have gotten a used one from Amazon... you know you need to be careful....\"I would be very careful about purchasing the MacBook pro now.","To make a long story short, HP phone support confirmed that I had some sort of hardware problem (most likely a bad motherboard or overheating issue) but they would not let me ship them my laptop for warranty repair because they could not confirm the date of purchase, despite the fact that I provided them copies of my receipts several times! I wound up taking the unit to a authorized HP service center - CompUSA - and they were able to get the unit fixed.","But once you have to deal with H-P on getting repairs and customer service, you\u0027ll be frustrated so be ready to complain and put on the disgruntled customer face...not that it helps.","My wonderful Gateway Solo 1150 finally gave up and the repair shop offered the Presario C301NR for $499, just $200 more than the repairs would have been.The wider keyboard is a bit of a stretch if you have small hands.","My screen is \u0027blacking\u0027 out on me and is unusable...Toshiba support ruled it as a hardware issue, as did I and now I have to either ship it back or bring it to a repair shop.","I have had this notebook for 2 years, and its in the repair center every year for something major.","HP is aware that there is a component/design problem and there was a class action suit, but I missed the window to have it repaired and now I\u0027m stuck with a piece of junk.","I have not paid for any of the repairs or shipments, but I use this computer for my business and it needs to be just a little bit more reliable.I\u0027ve owned this computer for a little over 2 months and have already had all these problems.","Not so with this model.Frankly, it is not much of a problem now, as I have not been listening to CDs for a while (thanks to iPods :), but back about 3 yrs ago I needed to burn music mixes on the CDs partly for my job and partly for my family, and it was a major problem, that I could not do it on this computer.2.The other, lot bigger and infinitely more annoying problem is the fan issue.From reading the reviews on other Toshiba laptops, this does not by far seem to be limited to just this particular model, but to other Toshibas as well.What I mean by that is the constant rapid outbursts, when the fan kicks in high gear, runs pretty loud for several seconds and stops... and the whole process repeats over and over till it drives you nuts... almost like a chinese torture, annoying, crazy-making, chipping away at you, and you cannot make it stop or get away from it.One thing is dealing with noisy fan, but it would be far more tolerable, if it ran constantly for awhile, then stopped, and was done with it.The only way to avoid this incessant on-and-off is to really put only minimal strain on the CPU and to not run too many programs at a time... which of course could be done, but in the big picture it is completely unacceptable having to deal with something like this in the first place.3.Another REALLY big thing are the missing parts of the screen.Not much more than a year after I bought it, about 1.5 inch wide blank white stripe popped up on the screen, running vertically, covering all the data underneath... it was distracting and unappealing, but it was positioned in a way, that was not interfering with the computer use, and I could work around it.About six months ago another stripe showed up, right at the START screen, covering all the important essential function needed for the proper computer use, and at that point I was almost ready to throw the laptop away.I was told, that the repair (as is usually the case with electronics) would be about as costly as getting a new unit, so I almost got a new one then.","Also saved all coorispondance from them to have if not repaired so I\u0027d have a case.","Apple\u0027s repair facility has had my notebook for more than four weeks now, and even after numerous phone calls to Apple\u0027s service center, I still don\u0027t have my notebook.","I have sent mine back for repairs.","There is some circuit board problem, that for me manifested itself almost a year after purchase.I am having to have it sent back for repair.","Well, the repair held and this machine continues to perform perfectly.","I have never mistreated this computer in any way that would cause damage to it, I even bought the $70 matching protective case to keep it safe!Sony\u0027s customer service is awful and there are no authorized repair services for sony laptops so you are pretty much forced into sending the computer out to San Diego to be repaired for two weeks.","The first one suffered from touchpad problems (clicking at random) and had to be sent out for repairs for a month right after i got it.","I\u0027ve read elsewhere than nVidia has spent hundreds of millions of dollars paying repair and replacement costs.","All I have done is six years is to replace a power supply, one battery, and repaired an F5 key.I like Dell products.","Unfortunately, HP does not stand by this product, as they state it is not a \"known issue\" (for this series, despite having the same processor/nvidia graphic chip combo) and they offered to repair it for an additional $400, after already suggesting I have it evaluated by an authorized repair center for $70.","I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NO LOCAL REPAIR SHOPS.","I have owned an HP Pavilion 4000 series notebook for about two years and have sent in for repair four times already.","For repair, Toshiba referred me to a local \"authorized service center\".","I\u0027ve had to have it repaired because the cooling unit was insufficient...I\u0027ve since bought a notebook cooler to keep it from heating up on me.- Too many bundled software, 75% of which I don\u0027t need and have had to uninstall.Some pros:- Nice, fast, reliable CD burner.- Excellent recovery program.","In doing so apple called me back 2 days after dropping it off to tell me that someone had spilled significant amounts of liquid on the laptop and they wont touch it without sending it to their repair department for no less than $750, more than the laptop is even worth.","Repair facility has no toll free number, I spent 5 hours on hold waiting for customer service and they don\u0027t return calls.","After shipping, a MB repair might be a good deal, or more expensive than a new computer after rebates.","I have had this laptop for 8 months and have sent it back to HP twice for repairs, that is not counting the number of times(and hours) spent on phone with the HP technical helpline to have malfunctions fixed via remote access.","BUT BEWARE, THEY BREAK RELENTLESSLY! I had a problem from the beginning, the sound stopped working, needed major repairs within 6 months of owning! Then Just after my extended warentee ran out the thing died all together! Out on nowhere the motherboard just crashed! This was after only two years of ownership on a pricey laptop.","The repair center told me:* P25 parts are being phased out.* No NEW parts are available.* There are scarce USED parts.* These have poor reliability.","And $750+ for a laptop repair??! You can get a fully loaded brand new HP or Dell, with much better and newer specs for LESS than their repair price and even a T61 Thinkpad for slightly more (if you shop smart)!!Sony \"robs\" you both when and after you buy.Generally speaking, Sony electronics have bloated prices which they don\u0027t warrant.","It runs too hot to put on your lap, shuts down 1-2 times a day (hard freeze), CD/DVD player too noisy to comfortably watch DVDs, AC connector broken twice, have had to pay $600 in repairs, HP wouldn\u0027t honor warranty.","Warranty expired, no repairs unless I was willing to fork out hundreds of dollars.","It had to be sent back to their sole North American repair facility in San Diego.","I called HP and was told that it was out of warranty but the Rep was knowledgeable enough to see notes that this particular model had system board issues and the warranty was extended for a year.HP sent me a call tag for free and had my laptop repaired with a week.","Their answer? Send it back for repair.","Recently, Sony added onsite service for an additional fee, but terms and conditions of what specifically can be repaired onsite are too vague for critical business use.Pro\u0027sBest Available ScreenIntegrated WiFiExcellent build qualityBest screen on the marketCon\u0027sPoor battery lifeHeavyPoor repair/customer serviceLack of system disksNo 7200 RPM factory drive I have been a long long time Apple supporter and have always recommended Apple over PC to everyone who asks my opinion - including my daughter.","Luckily, it was still under warranty both times we\u0027ve had to repair it, but I would be nervous to purchase one as a personal computer at home.","FINALLY THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE WAS THE SHIP THE COMPUTER TO SONY FOR REPAIR IN CALIFORNIA.","Please ask around before you purchase this computer because unbeknownst to me Compaq (now HP) has apparently tried to reduce costs on notebooks and it shows!I will give it 2 stars because luckily it crashed within its warranty (unluckily 2 weeks before exams!) and the tech support people were helpful and I can send it for repairs for free.","I was not willing to spend this kind of money on a laptop and have it in for repair longer than I had it.","(Knock on wood!)

Just to transfer my warranty information from sonystyle to sony it took about a week!My friends who have bought sony notebook also have faced some problem or the other and had warned me not to buy sony notebook but I was just carried away with the looks and features..I ended up buying a new lenovo notebook..","Apparently they either gave me a bad disk or didn\u0027t diagnose the problem correctly.I called tech support and they opened a new repair case number.","Need to buy Apple\u0027s extended warranty because very few people can open or repair it.","However, the company acknowledged both to me and twice to my secretary (who made followup calls when I found it too frustrating an exercise) that they had located the package and either the repaired unit or a replacement would be shortly enroute to me.","I can either run it into an authorized repair shop 7 miles from my house or they will pay to have it shipped.","Lo and behold, the companies recommended on Yelp and still listed on Lenovo\u0027s service provider page no longer do warranty repair because Lenovo does not pay them.Every time I call Lenovo I get a different answer, but after begging three different people to take the computer back and fix it there, I finally got one who agreed to send me a box so I can ship it back to have the OS installed.","The repair shop repairman advised me that the motherboard interface with the Wi-Fi card is defective and he will now ship the computer to an official HP repair facility.","I have registry repair and AVG detection installed but it does no good, so internet surfing is horrible.","USERS if u made the investment already, take care of it because regardless of TOSHIBA having great technology the only downer is that their parts and durabilty are not necessarily the strongest...in comparison to the new line of Sony Vaio Laptops my A35 is just one big peice of powerful plastic...if u refuse to do repairs there are companies wherein you can sell your computer and they will buy it off you for the good parts...I FOR ONE AM IN NO FINANCIAL POSITION TO GET UP AND REPLACE THE WHOLE THING ESPECIALLY WITH THE NEW COOLING SYSTEM AND HARD DRIVE...it has served me strong for the past 3 YEARS in MOVIE MAKING for school, music promotion, web-design, church-sermon audio recording/digital and many work and school related tasks, so far everything else is good for another couple years...thnx I have had this laptop for 3 years now.","He took it to a recommended computer repair specialist.","I took it in to the repair shop to get it fixed(out of my own pocket)and the guy there called HP and got an immediate response that they would pay for everything.","I point out that, as it stands now, they will take over 30 days for this repair, and request a replacement to get us back up and running again.","I took it back to circuitcity but upon looking at other DV1150s realized that this was a consistent manufacturing defect! and the PC runs absolutely fine and comes with great fatures like 80GB hdd @5400 and DVD RW drive... so I kept it.But the other DV1000 notebooks (like 1040, 1010 etc) are flawless!! maybe thats why this one is priced so low..nikhil(nwadwalkar@yahoo.com) I bought this HP laptop on 2/2007 I got rid of vista and installed XP pro, then I installed dual boot XP/Ubuntu, it worked great until I had the left hinge problem on 2/2009, lcd cover and bezel were also damaged with this, the cost to repair was $180.00 USD, but it is working fine now with Windows 7 Ultimate.","The unit I bought spent more time in the repair depot than me using it.Today I sent it for repair for the 5th time in less than a year.You name a problem - it had it - faulty motherboard, hard drive, keyboard,motherboard again.Customer service is not better than computer - they refuse to exchange iteven after so many times being in repair.This is a plain stupidity from their part - the money they spent paingfor repair and shipping by far exceeds the computer cost.This will be the last Toshiba anything I bue.","I confirmed the problem by calling sony customer support and even though it is a common problem sony will not fix my laptop without having to pay a $700 repair cost.After this incident i am never buying a Sony product again.","As nice as ibooks are when they work, theyre not worth $1000 plus frequent repair and many weeks a year without a computer.","It has now been over a month since I sent this computer to Toshiba for repair.","The forth person told me that the other three representatives were wrong on their analysis of my problem and she insisted that I send the entire computer to the repair facility.","The extended warranty should cover the repairs and a new laptop if the one you own cannot be fixed."],"aspect":"support","keyword":"repair"},{"responses":["Prices were better here at Amazon and better than Dell at the time.","Secondly have had problems with dvd drive, costumer service is ok, but I bought a DELL and its much better.","Dell is now my product of choice.Today I am connecting that laptop up to make my HDTV internet connected.","My Dell Inspiron is light and OK for most things, but it is falling apart after being treated fairly gently (OK, it fell from the passenger seat to the floor of the car once, but it was in a padded case!).","Checking online, I learned that the Vaio GRX models apparently have ongoing issues with running so hot that the motherboard actually warps.Yesterday, I ordered a Dell to replace the Vaio.","I am what they call a \u0027heavy\u0027 user that runs multiple applications, databases and servers simultaneously on a laptop all the time and I have not been disappointed by this laptop.Aside from a fast processor and the IBM/Lenovo reliability the features that made me choose this laptop over all others (including Dell and Sony) are:Keyboard: the keyboard bed on this laptop is strong, on other laptops if you push down a key the keyboard depresses and bends, not on this laptopBattery life: I installed an extra battery pack and it lasts a full 2.5 hoursWireless Reception: the reception on this laptop is much better than on any Dell that I have used.","No need to pour over an owner\u0027s manual.One con I can think of is the fragility of the machine - my husband has a smaller Dell that can seemingly be chucked around and beaten to death.","All in all, great products, great support from Apple.Plus, if you buy a Macbook, whenever you use it people come up and ask you about it! That sure never happens with a Dell.","They don\u0027t offer replacements...only an \"I\u0027m sorry.\"Back to Dell we go! Our second laptop, and this rocks over last year\u0027s Toshiba.","My HP always made the Dell look dark.","I did a lot of researches, asked for opinion from a lot people who are using Dell, HP, Lenovo \u0026 SONY.","After returning a Dell, I saw this VAIO and decided this was it.","My friends who bought Dell and Toshiba for $1300\u0027s (cheap when compare with what I spend $2000) around the same time I bought this Sony viao are using them without any problems and good features and great support.","It\u0027s really an amazing step up from anything I\u0027ve owned before.The wireless pulls down signals much more strongly than any laptop I\u0027ve used before (my previous laptops were top-of-the-line Dells), and the screen is big and bright with deep, rich colors.DVD viewing and multimedia files are pretty phenomenal on this machine, as well.If you\u0027re in the market for a laptop, it honestly doesn\u0027t get any better than this.","When I finally got to the point where I could deal with this computer again, I contacted Dell to return it.","Sony really needs to take a lesson from Dell and offer greater warranty coverage, especially for laptops, which tend to be more fragile and abused.In all, I think this computer is a great value for the money, particularly if you want something small and powerful with which to do music downloading and sharing.","Compared to other laptops in this class, like the DELL XPS 1210, this laptop is lighter, thinner, has a bigger screen (13.3 inches compared to 12.1 inches for the DELL) and looks much better too.","However, Dell decided to release new Inspirons, including one that is 14.1\".","I have experienced 0 problems and have also purchased the Apple Care with my computer as insurance which is the same as what Dell does as well, offer an extended warranty.","I have bought (or configured for others) 6 computers/laptops and have become disenchanted with Dell\u0027s quality and customer service.","I spent a painfully long time on the phone with Dell\u0027s customer support (even more frustrating was trying to understand the person on the other line through his very thick accent).","I ordered a Dell Inspiron laptop 1 1/2 years ago and it worked great until recently.","The Latitude series is the professional series of laptops by Dell enjoying longer warranty, extended service life cycles (meaning models arent phased out as quickly).","In this aspect, I prefer the Dell\u0027s response but backlit LED feature is not available.The trackpad is nice and big enough for mouse activity but sometimes gets in the way of my typing and can mess up with my typing especially when I have to reach out to the G, H, V, B and M keys.*LCD:The LCD is nice and bright and self-adjusts its brightness when in a low-light environment.","With the Dell laptop, it was like throwing a brick into my backpack.","Finally got Toshiba although it was more expensive(especially considering Dell online deals).","Very competitive with Dell\u0027s E1705, this is a great alternative for the aesthetically concious.","Wish the ac adapter was a bit smaller and there was a nice way to wind the cable around it for storage (like Apple or even Dell.)3.","The bluetooth works well with my Dell Axim.If you want to watch a movie on a plane, the volume is better in the windows mode than the AV mode.","Having 4 USB ports is a particularly desirable feature, and although I have only used the SIM card reader a few times, I can see how that would come in handy as well.I ended up choosing the Vostro over Dell\u0027s Inspiron 1520/1521 -- which is essentially the same computer, but is marketed toward home users, whereas the Vostro is labeled as a \u0027small business computer\u0027 -- because at the time, the Inspiron was only offered with the Vista operating system.","I have owned several Dell laptops, and while they have not been perfect, the warranty was good for defective parts that came up.","I have sent it back to HP and they have had it for 2 weeks now waiting for the part that they told me would take 3 days to fix.I miss my old dell and thinkpad, both which were road warriors.","The Dell gave us the most computer for the money we had to spend.","I had little problem adjusting to the smaller keys on the edges and am glad they were reduced in size instead of the primary keys (dell shrank all keys on the 700m).","Another Dell was not an option since I needed a Mac to run some Mac-only Bible study software (you read that right, software that only runs on a Mac!).","And not everything works well with Vista yet.Overall this was a good buy, and as far as I\u0027m concerned a better value than anything Dell or Toshiba can dish out.","BTW I laughed when reading another person\u0027s \"I have great luck with Dell and Apple,\" cuz those two companies use Asian sweatshops and cheap parts and their computers break down all the time.","Now however, I do use it to login to the laptop and it seems to work very well, with a success rate of over 98% recognition at the first swipe.10) Value for money - Given the fact that Sony offers only one year standard warranty (DELL gives 3 years on the D620), I feel that is still a bit pricey and a good price point for a machine like this would be around $1,650.","I bought my M35 earlier this month to replace an older Dell desktop computer.","I almost bought the DELL XPS 1210 but it looked cheap, was heavier and the screen was too small for comfort.","No diagnosis yet.I have never experienced any problems with the Dell, Gateway, and IBM laptops I have owned in the past.","I took it to an authorized Apple dealer in my country to look at it and I payed around 80 euros for investigation- they said maybe the NVIDIA chipset problem but after further investigation they said it something wrong with the logic board actually but they managed to make it work but they won\u0027t guarantee it will last for long; they offered 3 months of warranty; it cost me an additional 50Euros for this.- After exactly 3 years, again the same problem, but I moved to different country still in Europe (Belgium); they told me the investigation costs 85Euros and I payed; after 5 days they made a report: logic board faulty, total costs 1287 Euros!!!!Now, I ask you, any smart guy out there, who the hell will pay for this? And why should I buy ever again a MAC? So many problems, so EXPENSIVE repair?? This is outrageous.. and this was IT for me: I\u0027ll switch to a normal DELL/HP/Whatever laptop instead.","They did not respond.My brother in law bought a Dell computer.","For anyone who would rely at all on Tech support, I would strongly reccommend going with someone else.I just purchased a Dell E1705.",":DI compared the macbook with the dell xps m1330 with the LED backlight about 2 months ago and surprisingly the macbook had a better price point given all the features.","I purchased the Dell 1720 Inspiron to replace my old Inspiron 8600 (which had been a great computer for me).","I looked at Dell, and Overstock, and Amazon, and most of the laptops I wanted with at leasst 1GB were $1,000 to $1,500.","If I had it to do all over again I would go back to a DELL which caused me no problems in the 4 years I had it.","I looked at laptop offerings from Dell, Gateway, IBM, Compaq and Toshiba; HP, Sony, Fujitsu, and Winbook were never seriously considered, because I have had bad experiences with all of those manufactures notebooks in the past.","Dell laptops also have this feature.","The Dell physical specs include a screen with a large LCD screen, two mouse options (eraser button mouse-stick and trackpad), the front LCD clasp is held with one button (a bit stiff on several tested, should help to keep closed however).","The Intel 2200BG Wireless Card which comes with this laptop and also other laptopssuch as DELL, have a major problem of a \"Lost connection\" where you get disconnectedevery 1 minute for a 10-30 seconds.","They had me send it to the Dell Depot in Houston, Texas.","And if you purchase a Dell and it has any sort of issue, you will end up feeling as if you are on the Titanic and are slowly sinking to the demise of your pocketbook and sanity.To make an extremely long story short, we bought a Dell that never worked properly, and were told that if trouble-shooting did not work that we could return it.","Having just thrown out my old Dell Inspiron, a poorly-designed piece of junk with software and customer service to match, I resolved to make sure that my next purchase would last.","I\u0027ve had a Dell and a Toshiba, and both have failed me.","I\u0027ve been using various brands of laptops, including Dell, HP, and Compaq, and I still perfer the IBM T series.","Superior to the Dells and Winbooks that I\u0027ve been buying.","ocupo esta computadora para hacer trabajos de programacion y dise\u0026ntilde;os con grandes bases de datos la velocidad y la forma de manejar la memoria son exelentes, algunas veces la conecto a una red nt, a internet, a una pocket pc y no baja su rendimiento, pase tres meses buscando un computador de bajo precio con tecnologia de punta, y esto compre u no me arrepiento, la compare con la de la marca dell, compaq y ninguna supera a esta laptop.","But it was a workhorse and I kept mine for eight years before going into a desktop era with a Dell and my current machine, a Sony VAIO.I didn\u0027t think I could afford both a desktop and a notebook but when I saw a deal for this Toshiba Satellite L25 at a local Comp USA I bought.","I have now spent 3-4 hours on hold, been hung up on twice, and have talked to approximately 10 very friendly but completly unhelpful Dell customer service employees, none of which seem to speak english as a first language, who have bounced me back and forth from department to department.","David Pogue\u0027s book iMovie HD was an invaluable helper in the project.After using a Dell laptop for years, I am impressed by the way the iBook instantly is ready to use on opening the display, and how the iBook usually runs silently.","By which I mean that their products are very attractive-looking but also very overpriced, overhyped, and totally dependent saleswise on the huge (and expensively maintained) brand-name recognition.However to be fair, Sony unlike Bose does at least publish full specs on all of its computers, where Bose doesn\u0027t even tell you how many watts per channel its audio stuff is! And Sony isn\u0027t quite THAT bad for computers, just notoriously unreliable.My wife was given one of these computers at work and it has been constantly in the shop!I have worked in IT for over 20 years and the machines that we spend the most time repairing are Sony VAIOs and Compaqs/HPs.My advice is, if you\u0027re on a budget go with Dell and if you have more money to spend buy a Toshiba or IBM.","Think about this before you buy, the buttons are ineffective, and positioned for elf hands - I\u0027ve never had hand strain in 15 years of computing until this HP! My wife\u0027s Dell is the opposite - easy buttons and ergonomic.","My laptop has outlasted my brother\u0027s Toshiba, countless Dells belonging to friends, AND a Macbook.-Battery never lasted more than 2 hours.-CD/DVDrom is kind of noisy.I definitely recommend this model.","I don\u0027t want to sound pessimistic, but if it\u0027s not about the money, aim a little higher.If you look for a really modestly priced business laptop, this might just be one of the best out there, compare to simliar Thinkpads, Toshibas and Dells.","I own this laptop myself and it is very impressive I have owned dell and hp laptops before and I got to hand it to toshiba, my satelite is superior to hp and dell.","The entire process went pain free and in the time frame promised.I ordered and paid for a Dell Latitude D610.","We still have a Dell desktop and the Airport is hooked up to it with a cable.","If you want more value for your money - you\u0027re probably better off with something like a Dell.","My 10 year old Dell that has 14 GB of memory left doesnt crap up as much as my Toshiba.","I love my Vadem Clio so I am already sold on the touch screen and while I am totally happy with Dell when I tried to meet the specs of this little guy I was looking at 1800+ and no tablet features! At $1,449 this was a great deal! But you can do better for the money because although new computers cost a bit more they are loaded with programs.","This means a very low likelihood of receiving a screen with dead pixels (a problem I consistently have with Dell).I was a bit confused with all of Sony\u0027s model #s for the R505 SuperSlim Pro series, but they are all basically the same with slightly different specs.I will tell you the benefits of buying a Sony vs the cons.Pros1) Sony has the best LCD screens hands down.","MACS have alot of ram, kick butt graphics/video cards, and have more hard drive space than any other laptop from gateway, intel, compaq,Spartan, Toshiba, or Dell.","Congratulations I hope you keep this service The Dell C640 may be an older model yet it is surprisingly adroit with Windows XP SP3 running 512MB of RAM.","I got a new laptop and like it a lot BUT I found out trying to install all my old accessories, that vista for example did not recognise my printer or my dell mp3 player.","I bought it when it was $1,000, a year later laptops from HP \u0026 Dell from the same generation that run about $600 blow it out of the water.","I\u0027ve read reviews were people have said that it doesn\u0027t have enough ram, mb, gb etc. but just because most notebooks have more that doesn\u0027t mean that this one does come with enough, all I know is that it does what I want it to do and that it moves ten times faster than my Dell desktop.","The Dell CPx is built like a rock.","They stock their standard systems with multimedia software that will give you great advantages over equivelant Gateway\u0027s or Dell\u0027s.","And after I used a Dell pentium 4 laptop for a few weeks I definitely wasnt going to buy a PC.Came loaded with the same OS as my home computer, so not too mant differences in that regards, though Photo Booth is fun.","All my earlier laptops have been Dell machines.The S260P has worked great for me all these years, I did at some point increase the memory.After using it for as long as I have, it appears that the speed has slowed down.... may be it is just perception or could be the accumulation of all the junk and a truck load of pictures that I have loaded up with, along with running Norton AV, Norton Ghost and MS Defender, Ad-ware as well as Spyware Blaster.About 3 months ago I was on a biz trip when late on Friday I discovered that the touch pad and main power button had frozen and I could virtually not do any thing.Due to the urgency of the situation and with unsuccessful trips to Best Buy - Geek Squad and Circuit City - Fire Dog (both could not resolve the problem).","I contacted Dell and they told me I needed more memory, even though this computer should have had enough memory.","I sold it to a friend for a very good price and ordered a Dell Mini 9 netbook to take traveling.","Needless to say I have ordered another computer from Dell.","A VERY GOOD NOTEBOOK-LAPTOP, EXCELENT BATTERY LIFE, I DO RECOMEND TO BUY THIS ONE DELL PORTABLE, IS ONE OF THE BESTS A well functioning little machine, maybe for some people some what slow, but I can work it.For the money it is quite good.","The slowest Core 2 Duo Dell offers is the 1.83GHz T5600, which runs much faster benchmarks.","Anywhere I worked I advocated that we used Apples.In the mid/late 90\u0027s I had to buy a PC, I got a Dell laptop, which - I thought - worked adequately.","Half-life 2 brought my Dell to its knees.This Compaq is amazing.","I got that to hook up to my Dell 2005FP monitor with digital signal.","I dont have to worry about viruses or other nonsense like that like I use to have to deal with all the time with my old Dell laptop.","it is fast and really durable and i like the keybord better then dells I am now on my third Thinkpad (I have actually bought four one as a gift).","After 3 seperate lengthy chats they authorized that the display adapter be replaced.In a few days a contracted service technician (authorized by Dell) came to my home and replaced the display adapter.","Thank you Great computer for the Price........much better then the Dell laptop I have and costs about the same......Sony....the one and only!!! great computer !!!!! great screen, fast working, nice style, great design....the bad thing for me (and its the same for ever HP model of this kind) is that the lock string attaches to a little hole in the screen panel, and if someday you, or someone pull\u0027s the computer with the lock attached, it will sufer damage .....","And secondly I had my last Dell computer crash and and lost everything I did not back up.","I love Dell computers they are awesome machines but, the people who chose the Dell power supplies for their workstations have a morbid sense of humor.I guess Dell chose the lowest bidder on power supplies and trust me it for sure shows.","A week before I was leaving for vacation Dell had taken the 14.1\" laptop off their website.","Dell has decent laptops too but to configure with the features you want it is clearly $800 or more.","It is there, and you can reach them, but they don\u0027t seem to be as knowledgeable as the Dell support I get with my tower.","I rate Toshiba services SUPERIOR to Dell (especially responsiveness), and FAR SUPERIOR to Gateway (I am an IT exec and I refuse to purchase Gateway products).","I will never have a desktop again! I have other Dells.","The screen is bright and there are no bubbles or discrepancies of any kind, and the fact that the LCD panel is on one giant hinge basically ensures you won\u0027t get a flimsy hinge (common to Dell laptops, with two small hinges positioned at each end of the panel), and the battery is sufficient for small tasks (excel sheets, writing essays, watching movies on a plane, etc).","Computer is much faster than my old HEAVY Dell SmartStep 250N that had terrible sound.","I bought it to replace my Dell Inspiron 5000e which was over 4 years old and broke down on me.","I recently purchased this Sony to replace my Dell and the weight of it works great since I am able to transport it well here in NYC.","The dell\u0027s would report 2 hours and once I used Firefox the battery life would drop to 30 minutes.","After this experience, I will don\u0027t think I will go back to Sony again.PROS:* Stylish looks, all aluminum palm rest (but cheap lid design)* Weights 4lb 3.4oz (I measured it with my postal scale)* Intel Duo Core @ 1.83GHz* 1GB of DDR2 RAM* Huge 120GB HDD (5400RPM)* First dual graphics laptop* GeForce Go 7400 (top of the line \"thin-n-light\" graphics processor from NVIDIA)* Nice little built-it webcam (but very low quality videos and pics)* Very bright screen (but had 3 defective pixels in a row)* Runs very cool and very quiet (even when playing 3D games)* Can play Dungeon Siege II at 1024x768 with medium setting at around 40-60fpsCONS:* Cheap looking lid surface (feels like sand paper)* No locking hinge for LCD screen* Annoying external Wi-Fi antenna (even without GPRS option)* Makes loud-whining noise when playing DVDs with labels (i.e. Memorex, Neato)* Battery jiggles and doesn\u0027t feel secured in place* Huge AC adapter weights exactly 1 pounds and is bigger than Dell\u0027s normal adapter* Battery life is a little disappointing (2h:45m on performance mode and 3h:15m on stamina mode) Let me start with a simple disclaimer, first I worked for Apple (a long time ago) for 11 years, I also worked for Microsoft for 6 years and I\u0027m pretty comfortable in both camps but I truly love Apple for it\u0027s design and combined hardware/software implementations.","So I\u0027m thinking when you buy a DELL Dimension get one of these things thrown in.Also, there are limited drive bays but, in a USB/Firewire world does it matter?Finally the thing is dead quiet - my old Gateway sounds like I\u0027ve left the vacumn on, but this Dell is whisper quiet.Overall I\u0027m three days into it... took a while to kill the AOL virus they load on the darn things and the stupid free trial Word Perfect junk, but so far so good.Hopefully it\u0027ll last like my Gateway (blue screens of death now and then but my Gateway keeps on chuggin\u0027... 7 years now).Oh, by the way, DELL support is pretty good but you have to talk to a computer for 10 minutes and sit on hold on a fuzzy line for another 5 before you get a real person who has to put you on hold 7 times to answer your question... then they try to sell you someting else like a warranty or other \u0027program\u0027... but hey, they\u0027re really polite...","It\u0027s a pleasure to carry about, much easier to actually use on my lap than my Dell was.2) I do browsing, word processing and desktop publishing, mp3s, and digital photo tweaking.","Just that damn stupid amber light when your Dell power supply croaks.","It took me about 25 minutes on the phone with Dell support, to have them ship to me a new stick.","I\u0027ve used Toshiba, IBM, and Dell\u0027s - The screen quality is really outstanding with the GRX Size of the charger unit.","Perhaps this is why the motherboards in so many of their units bite the dust.I\u0027ve been twice disappointed with Dell products.","I purchased my 4030 for 1290 when dells sold at 799 with better features.Problems:Its slow! My Inspirion same processor etc. is faster by a long shot.The mousepad stops responding constantly! It apparently happens to many HP;s Google it.Order it with Broadcom Wireless.","This is a company computer and it is JUNK! I have a Dell desk top at work and an Apple ibook for home use so I know both O/S.","Excellent bargain for word processing, watching videos, listening to music, browsing the web, and other everyday apps.BUT, and it\u0027s a big one, if you want to upgrade DO NOT BUY A DELL! Dell uses a lot of proprietary hardware, particularly the Power Supply Unit! This is something you MUST upgrade if you want to upgrade your video card.OK, another caveat.","Most of my DELL tricks just do not work on these Sonys.","I enjoy using it compared to my older Dell laptop.","For the same features, the x205 beats the price of comparable Dell models by a couple hundred.","I purchased this computer for under $500 in the summer to replace a $1100 Dell.","Given a choice between a new Asus or Dell netbook or a used iBook G4 for the same price, I would take the G4 without thinking about it for a second.","That is not the case with the Dell Latitude C610, which I purchased refurbished in June 2004.","Before settling on this laptop, I considered similar units by Dell and HP.","And one of the best parts?

I know that 1.42 isn\u0027t much better than 1.30, but this is dell\u0027s low-end 600M.","Amazingly, the power supply on my old Dell 5150 weighed more than one pound! The Powerbook is solidly constructed and yet neither functionality nor aesthetics have been compromised.","Price is everything if you\u0027re considering one of these older Dell\u0027s in 2006... since decent NEW laptops commonly start at only $500 or so.","After looking at HP, Sony, dell and Compaq.","Dell, and Gateway have good offerings in this price range as well.On the good side you get a 15\" screen very cheap, and the DVD drive is a little faster than most notebook offerings (16x vs. 8x).","Dell\u0027s XPI CD is my favorite laptop of all times.","I\u0027m very impressed that I haven\u0027t burned my legs when I have it on my lap, as I have done many times with my Dell laptop!I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, the keyboard is a little awkward to use, and those with small hands might want to shift the primary mouse button to the right.","GET A DELL.","The wirless works perfectly, connects instantly, much faster than my Dell Latitude D620.","The return policy conditions, though understandable, delayed pickup of the product, which in turn delayed the credit to my account, which in turn delayed my alternate purchase from Dell.","I must admit my software question was not basic but it was something Dell walked me through when I set up my kid\u0027s desktop at Christmas time.Great value on a basic but ever so much better than a low end or celeron chip notebook.","The FXA47 is a sleek machine and when it works, it is wonderful.I run a number of machines with XP and all perform better than this laptop, especially my Dell laptop.The FXA47 hangs repeatedly when using standard programs such as the microsoft office family.","When Apple comes out with a G5 laptop, wait at least a year for them to work out the bugs before buying.If you are deciding between mac and pc, ask yourself the following questions: Do you need to run specialize software that will only run on the PC?

I just helped a neighbor pick out a Dell laptop for his business.","I did a benchmark test side by side against my Dell Inspiron 2650.","I purchased a Dell Inspiron 1720, refurbished, and it has been nothing but trouble since the box was opened.","- the price ^^ this laptop is a excellet buy for it\u0027s price tag. similar slim note book for Sony or Fujisu cost almost double.After did some research, i\u0027vd decided to try this laptop.(i had Dell Inspiron before).","For such a thin notebook, it is actually heavier than the MacBook Pro by Apple, but lighter than the Dell E1505, both of which have graphics cards not integrated into the system.Price - priced really high.","We did try various display settings.I have used other laptop brands - dell, ibm/lenovo, hp; had no complaints on the laptops display.You need to see it before you buy.","Battery life is average I recently bought an apple powerbook laptop 12\",that was listed as used but in very good condition.I was concerned about making a purchase like this from an unknown seller that seemed to be new to the site-but I trusted the Amazon site.The price was really good and the description impressive;so although I knew very little about the item I decided to risk it.I had been using a dell for about 4 or 5 years;the last 2 or 3 of which were computer hell.And I had been vowing to next time get a mac since I heard they were less aggravating in regards to things like freezing up for no reason,bogus error messages that I couldn\u0027t possibly understand,e-mail that wouldn\u0027t open for 5 minutes \u0026 then didn\u0027t like to receive or send mail some days,15minute boot-ups,and web pages(when I finally got on) that got stuck when I tried to scroll.Well, needless to say I am ecstatic! Everything actually does what you tell it to and almost instantaneously.I have made the adjustments without all that much hassle.Thought I might mind the smaller screen but not at all.Within the first week-I had done mail,gone on the internet,installed my mouse,the font I wanted,had it reading stuff for me,installed games,have it tell me the time etc etc etc.It is that user friendly.There is just too much to love about it to even list.I would NEVER go back to any other pc again!I am in computer heaven! I recently bought an Averatec AV3225HS notebook computer.","I was looking for new laptop to replace my old dell.","Regarding the product,I think Sony needs to learn how Dell and HP package their laptops (with manuals and goodies).","Buy Dell or HP or anyone else.","My Dell looked like a brick and was full of spyware and viruses.It\u0027s a great feeling to never have to worry about viruses or spyware.I miss the right and left click mouse buttons though.","Visit Dell and buy a new one, that is faster, has more RAM, a larger HD, and better graphics for the same price or even less.The 75% off they are advertising is a joke.","Many of our locations complain about the premium price that our company pays for an Apple product as opposed to a Dell or HP system.","whereas, i know my macbook pro will be ready for whatever i throw at it for 5 more years.on a side note, i also own a Dell M1330, and it\u0027s just 1.5 lbs heavier, but gives me alot more (cpu, hd, ram, and video!) power for almost half the price.","Excellent! After having my Dell laptop replaced 3 times in 2 years I decided to ditch the PC and switch to a Mac.","Can\u0027t complain about the machine, it\u0027s faster than my old laptop I paid $2k for and it\u0027s a lot lighter.I\u0027ve been buying a lot of Dells for the office and decided to look elsewhere after a few factory defects.","A tech person at our school district recommended this brand to me over dell, hp.","I am corresponding with Dell right now about this experience.","Just remember: the battery life has limitations, the keyboard is not nearly as solid feeling as Dell\u0027s and HP\u0027s (but is nicely sized), and the appearance is pretty \u0027square\u0027 in all respects.","Graphics by Nvidia\u0027s Go 7600 are great for gaming, often a tough task for a notebook, but one I demand.Complaints?

Sounds like the Dell folks tend to get functioning laptops at a great frequency than Sony folks.","This laptop is one of the best and most reliable; I\u0027ve updated it to windows 7 x64 and the RAM to a full 4G to keep it as current as possible.This is a great machine and I will gladly buy from Dell again - in fact I\u0027ll probably stick to high-ends and get an alienware from them in the next year or two.","I bought the Gateway (instead of a Dell, which is 1.33 inches thick)and measured it.","After a week, I started having doubts whether I should keep the iBook or return it for a Dell or other Windows based laptop.","But now decided to try HP after I got burned with a Dell E1505 inspiron notebook recently.","I bought this notebook to replace my Dell 8600.","After a lot of research and waiting for price drops, especially on Dell and Sony, I decided to go with Toshiba.","You can use Windows Movie Maker to make a movie, but I haven\u0027t found anything that lets you shoot stills with it (and I don\u0027t care about web cams and IM).All in all, however, I\u0027d highly recommend buying this machine if you\u0027re after features, performance, and the best screen around! I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll love it as much as I do! I bought this machine because I had a Dell that boke down and had lots of problems with it.","It was well packed, and the box and computer both contained a number of special items,e.g.,a handsome Dell carrying case,a double PC card slot with a modem card installed, an old fashioned mouse giving me a choice between the traditional notebook \"mouse\" and the mouse I am used to.","Earlier this year I bought a dell 700m for my wife.","The material use is much better quality than the Dell,or HP.","I used Dells and other Toshibas in the past.","Check specifications before making a purchase, Harman Kardon speakers of Toshiba notebooks are awesome compared to junk laptop speakers put by Acer, Dell, Sony, IBM, HP and others.If you\u0027re short in money or not looking for the above mentioned features then go ahead and buy Acer.","I have no idea how old the computer is, or what modifications were made to the hardware/software before I bought it.I originally bought this computer because my 10+ year old Dell laptop was finally giving up the ghost.","I haven\u0027t heard of anyone having \"show-stopper\" problems with the G4\u0027s.I had a few peripherals that I didn\u0027t want to part with, like my Dell Axim.","My girlfriend has a Dell with a Pentium M processor, and my Powerbook performs much better.","I checked the website and saw that it was listed as compatible with the Dell Latitude 600 series.","I have compared my reception to my girlfriend\u0027s Dell, and where she gets 5 full bars, I get 4 and sometimes oscillates between 3 and 4.The battery on my PowerBook was also dead on arrival when I received it.","And I see in the case of this model that you\u0027re getting 256 MB RAM -- you\u0027ll need at least 512 MB, or your computer will crawl between applications.I know laptops will run hot -- but Dell laptops seem to run exceptionally hot.","I was looking for a replacement to my old and heavy Dell Inspiron 8200.","I only had a couple requirements: (a) not a Dell, (b) powerful enough to handle my everyday tasks, but still had to be light enough that I could put it on my lap without it feeling too heavy.","OS X just makes everything easier and more fun, the system never crashes, the included software is incredible, and despite the clock speed discrepencies between the G4 and Pentium 4, my PowerBook trounces my Dell P4 2.6GHz! Also, be advised that spyware, adware, malware and virii are not isues on a Mac, and Apple\u0027s included web browser (Safari), mail client, and IM client are all at the top of thier respective classes.","Heat (after an hour of use, it does get hot but still comparable to most Dells of this size).3.","I\u0027d buy another Dell D820 used for $400.","... but this is a great attempt!

My beloved Dell Inspiron 1100 was stolen so I wanted something smaller \u0026 lighter to take with me.","Dell is a good brand but the people that I got mine from are rip offs.","Pros:* Sturdy: This computer can take more beatings than a Dell.* Cheap: Because it\u0027s an older model, it\u0027s cheap, and it\u0027s also ...* Ubiquitous: Although IBM fell from its throne quite a while ago, IBM parts are still EVERYWHERE, and they\u0027re dirt cheap for good quality.","Better looking than Dell or Acer, but not as nice as Vaio\u0027s.","I receive a Dell Latitude D600 instead of the Dell Latitude C640.","As a Dell \u0026 Apple owner, I admit to being a bit apprehensive over this HP.","The 17\" BrightView screen and 10-key pad make the DV8110us a great desktop replacement for my Dell XPS 4600.","The touch pad is not as easy to use as others (e.g., Dell, HP).","In the last year, I have personally owned Compaqs, Dells, IBMs, Acers, Sonys, and other laptops; including Pentium 3m, AMD Athlon XPm, and Pentium 4m models.","speed amost the same as my dell p4 3.2ht, dell beat by a few points in the benchmark test.but didn\u0027t get it for speed.","Dell does not provide this service and will not tell you how to do this.","When that Friday after Thanksgiving sale hit, I was in line and lucked out.Out of the case:Not that I am into it, but this is a stylish, sleek, attractive laptop (here I am comparing it to my daughter\u0027s dull Dell 2200, if you have ever seen one).","I am a programmer,I have many laptops, three HP, one Dell and this one.I bot a A135-s2246 about two years ago, it was cheap, it worked fine for about 10 month and then the LCD went black screen, it was within the warranty, so they fixed it for me, and one month ago, the computer suddenly went blank screen again, and I have no idea what caused it.","The only way you can choose something besides Vista (which you may have to if you work a lot with software that isn\u0027t compatible yet) is to go with Dell notebooks.","Much better hardware reliability and better support in my experience with Compaq, Toshiba, Dell, etc. excellent machine..","The legendary IBM keyboard? All Dell Latitude series these days have pretty much the same keyboard, and they come with better configs plus TRULY international support.5.","I bought this computer from Dell in 2007.","Even Windows Update site doesn\u0027t have the drivers listed for these devices, so you\u0027re on your own once you get out of default-factory-installed software environment.I wish Compaq had better support - Dell lists virtually every drivers and updates you need for almost any operating systems including Linux.Bottom line: This is an OK product if you are a casual user and intend to use it the way Compaq wants you to use.","I use mine on a college campus, and people balancing huge Dell \u0026quot;laptops\u0026quot; are always gawking at this lean notebook.","With rebates, I paid little more than half that and am very pleased.I was concerned that the RAM hungry Vista would make this IGB RAM product sluggish, but it seems super-fast compared to the 4 year old XP loaded Dell Latitude that it replaces and that cost around $1,500.","I quoted it around $3800 from Dell...forget that !!The tx1220us from HP is a very nice Tablet PC.","I bought a new laptop from DELL with a 3 year warranty because I am not making the same mistake twice.","Somebody knowledgeable told me this is true of TV reception on all computers; I wish I had known that before I bought this P25.I should mention that I had just previously sent back a Dell laptop with many of the same features because it was crashing and locking up out of the box.","Never gone wireless before? Oh you will! You\u0027ll be busting out your cool little iBook at every coffee shop, library and airport...then your wireless house! I made the mistake of doing business with Dell and purchased an E510.","HP, Dell, compaq, etc. have all had recalls of numerous laptops.","Great keyboard (this is what drove me away from Dell - the new Dell notebooks have serious issue with their keyboards; I touch type at the rate of around 70 words/pm and I get lot of repeated keys in Dell; HP keyboard is great! I like this)3.","I am very pleased with my purchase.Before I get into details, a brief background: this is my first laptop, after having owned two Dell desktops.","Support by Dell was great but who wants to continuously ship components in and out.On the whole I\u0027m very satisfied with this laptop.","Yes, I have good ears, and maybe some folks wouldn\u0027t ever notice the problem, but I have four Dell machines that sound great with the same music sources; the last thing I expected was that this new machine from a highly respected manufacturer would have such a fatal flaw.If you are planning to use this machine for music, test it first in the store with headphones before buying.Long story short, I gave Toshiba a chance to redeem itself through good customer service and they are failing at that, too.","Dell provides drivers for other versions of Windows even though it didn\u0027t come with the computer.","I\u0027ve compared and considered about 15 machines since, including popular items such as HP and Dell, and even after 6 months, I still have no regrets.","I agree that it is weak, especially relative to Dell and others.","I upgraded from a Dell M1210 (with nVIDIA video) to this machine.","My only con point is that the keyboard has a lighter feel than my Dell that I am slowly getting used to.","Having owned 4 Dell laptops, I priced another one.","I repeatedly compared hardware to hardware of other venders (i.e. Dell, HP, Sony, etc.)","I contacted Dell and they told me I needed more memory, even though this computer should have had enough memory.","Way better than my Dell.","I\u0027ve used Toshiba, IBM, and Dell\u0027s - The screen quality is really outstanding with the GRXSize of the charger unit.","I had an expensive company Dell that literally smoked its motherboard while I was working with it.","However, compared to the Dell E1505 and comparable other vendors I felt that the Toshiba was the clear winner.The only downside that I decided to \"settle\" for was the mediocre graphics engine that is provided with the S4517/S4467.","I started as most do by comparing a number of models, Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq etc..","My last PC was a Dell and I currently have a Dell Laptop with the same specs as this Toshiba at work.","The SZ has a traditional tray DVD burner drive.Both the 1330 and SZ use an NVIDIA graphics card, and I think the Dell uses a newer one, but I don\u0027t know how they compare.","I will stick to Toshiba or Dell in the future, companies who were far more supportive of their products and customers.","I\u0027ve switched over to using the laptop exclusively for Windows development at work, because it\u0027s just so much faster at building the projects than the 600mhz Dell with 384MB ram I was using.","All that changed when I accidentally broke the Toshiba and had to purchase a new laptop.I search high and low for a thin-n-light (under 5lbs) laptop, the decision came down to the Sharp M4000, Dell Latitude D620, Lenovo Thinkpad Z60t and this.","It\u0027s packed with the same or better features than more expensive similar notebooks(e.g. Dell, Sony, etc).","However, as most now are aware, Dell\u0027s customer service has been quite unimpressive of late.","The only laptop that I\u0027ve seen with a compatible resolution is the dell 17\" series with the optional 1920x1200 resolution screen.","I WAS ON MY DELL D600 (1.6GHZ, 40 GB HARD DRIVE, DVD/CD-RW) YESTERDAY AND A BIRD CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND FLEW AWAY WITH IT.","My getting used to the touch pad is definitely work in progress I was looking at buying a Dell, but every time I\u0027d configure the options I wanted, the price jacked up to 1800+.","Just like my Dell 700m, this isn\u0027t an option because of the location of the jack.","I use my 4 year old Dell desktop instead whenever possible because it is twice as fast.","Cost [alot] for a 256MB upgrade (almost 25% of the laptop cost!) !!!! Compaq, Dell and Gateway have ultra\u0027s very similar to this either out or coming out in the next few weeks ....","This machine ships with updated drivers, so it instantly recognized the mouse which meant I was off and clicking in no time.Unlike my old Dell laptop, this one allows me to turn off the touchpad when using a mouse, and that makes me very happy.","I have been users for both Dell and Thinkpad for around 10 years.","From what I can tell, that\u0027s not lucky - that\u0027s the norm.As I use the PowerBook more frequently, I find myself going to my Dell less and less.","I was able to get help from Dell but I waited on the phone for hours and every person that I talked to had a very hard time speaking English well.","Only on this Dell.","I moved to Dell exclusivley about 7 years ago, but I have tired of the deteriorating service and support.Toshiba caught my eye and I like each machine a little better.","Dell charges sales tax which makes a 6% difference in price real fast.","It was really heavy, didn\u0027t have built in WiFi and I was tired of the spyware and pop ups that made my Dell run so SLOW!I bought this iBook in December and I freaking *LOVE* it.","I just wish all these companies can ship machines cleaner and provide all the junks on a CD or something.2.The build time is longer than Dell before shipping the product is exactly what i bought and preforms adequately.","And because I\u0027d bought the Toshiba laptop through Office Depot, I had absolutely no recourse in disputing the charge through my credit card.I had to purchase yet another laptop - this time a Dell - while the Toshiba spent weeks being repaired.More than a year later, I know I will NEVER purchase and will never recommend Toshiba to anyone.","Sony, IBM, HP, Dell, Compaq, Gateway all follow (in order according to numerous user responses).","It\u0027s far worse than enything I ever experienced with my Dell laptops in the past.","It has a somewhat cheaper \"feel\" to it overall as compared to Sony Vaios or Dells, but of course, it IS cheaper! (It is nowhere near as cheap-feeling as the bargain Acer/Lenova/etc types.)I have experienced no problems getting used to the keyboard (though it does have a lot of flex).","At Best Buy, I discovered that the Sony XBR screen and screen hinges--one of which broke both on my old Dell and on a friend\u0027s Dell--were absolutely superior in quality to those of every other manufacturer.","Neither my Dell or the Asus computers drop the signal like the Sony.It\u0027s fine for email and regular stationary work that doesn\u0027t require a reliable connection to upload/download streams.","Consider this:1) IBM, Toshiba and Dell have fewer quality issues than Compaq, and Toshiba and Dell both have celeron models that cost about the same as Compaq.2) While this computer is working fine for me, I have noticed a few problems.","[...] dell X [...]","All work PC\u0027s are dell machines.","My 1999 Dell had the speakers on the sides and were aimed toward the user which created great stereo imagery and the tiny speakers were crystal clear.","DELL is much better concerning new computers and costumer support.","My decision was again for Sony.Pros:bluetooth/wifidvd burner includedportabilityusability despite the sizegreat screen qualitylooksmetal looking keyboardfingerprint securitybattery lifecard readersno additional cost upgrade to vista (soon newer versions will probably be delivered with Vista)Cons:No camera I used to have toshiba laptops, so I decided to try with Dell, the computer looks good, but I think are not well configurated, almost all the time I have conflict problems with windows (I never have this problem with toshiba).","I went through all the Sunday ads and specials, went to Dells website, and then compared their prices and features to Apple\u0027s Macbook line.","I was back and forth between a Dell and a Toshiba but didn\u0027t feel like ordering the Dell online and waiting for it to be shipped to me.","People worry about the expense, but recently I have seen Dell notebooks go at $[...]+ compared to my 2GB MacBook that I bought for $[...].","I would have to lift my Dell off the bed about every 30 minutes to makes sure the pent M processor \"cooled down\".","I have owned 2 Dell PC\u0027s in the past 8 years and have made the almost seamless switch to one of the best computers I have worked on, the Mac Powerbook.","This laptop is highly serviceable and the documentation has always been available from Dell.","At home I hook my PB up to a Dell 17\u0026quot; flat panel, and the graphics card (which I raised to 128 megs of video) has no problem running both the native display and the Dell.","Dell\u0027s laptops have gotten almost pitiful in quality, while IBM are insanely priced.","At this point I\u0027m sorry I switched and I wrote this review with my Dell.","Today I have a couple of IBM laptops and Dell desktops, all running Windows XP Pro.","One might ask..if you had a P4 Dell why did you get a new laptop? Easy Dell Sucks BAD!! They are the Bose of the computer world.","I\u0027ve noticed Dell\u0027s new laptops use some sort of sheet metal that dents like aluminum, you won\u0027t find that cheap stuff on this machine.","I bought this computer 2 years ago and I keep waiting for it to break or slow down like my other old notebooks, (Compaq and Dell).","It\u0027s so bad, I actually forked over $1800 of my own money to get a Dell.","The operating system is beautiful and runs smoothly even when multitasking.When I\u0027m at home, I connect the PB to a Dell 21\" LCD monitor running at 1600x1200 resolution, and a wireless keyboard and mouse.","With the nvidia card I am now using 24 watts, with the intel card I would be using about 22! During SF4 it jumps up to 44 watts, which is still better than the 150 watts the xbox uses, but possibly not better than the dell xps m1330 which uses 20 watts at idle and supposedly 35 watts when maxed out.","My old Dell 600m got warmer than this.","Buy an extended warranty if you can and look at IBM (now Lenovo) or Dell as they highly reliable laptops.","I did not measure it, but it\u0027s a lot shorter than my old Dell notebook, which is just about average length.","I find it marginally acceptable, but I would not spend my own money on such a system.Major misses:1) It comes with the synaptics touchpad, which defaults to accepting taps as mouse clicks (it should default to the \u0027suppress taps\u0027)2) Shutdown service takes too long, even for Windows 2000.3) No option to order with Linux or without Windows, even though Dell previously touted this feature.For everyday use, I still gravitate toward my iBook.","Never has my Dell looked so ugly than when next to this aluminum beauty.I powered up the Powerbook and quickly figured out my way around.","The laptop fits into my existing Tumi cases and is/feels a lot lighter and sturdier than the Dell 610.Overall, a very happy customer.","this never happened on my HP and my old dell. everything just connected automatically.bottom line.... it\u0027s a pretty laptop to look at.. but i believe the bads out weigh the goods.","Pictures on the LCD look extremely crisp and vibrant, better than my 19in Dell flat panel.CONS:Backlighting is dimmer than the premium models (e.g. SZ360).","I have toshiba tablet and 2 dell laptops.","Having found an equivalent Dell would cost about $800-$1000 more, I decided to make a change.","Not to mention having to send my AC adapter in for the recall.My Dell gets very, very hot (almost too hot to touch) so I thought it was high time to get a new one.","I\u0027ll gladly take this over any dell, hp pos.","As this is my first laptop, I wanted it to be at least as up to snuff tech wise as my aging 1.8 pent Dimension 8200 (this desktop was a higher end dell several years ago).","Having already owned a 12 inch Dell 700m that was aging, and a 14 inch HP dv2000 duo core (not aging), I found this for a decent price, and was curious to see how it compared.My first impression was that the appearance is more \u0027square\u0027 than the other two laptops, and that the gray closed surface is IBM-ish plain.","I have not used the Dell XPS 1330, but after some scrutiny I chose the VAIO.","the quality of tech support is not good.Very slow...There is not support really after 2 years - the charge you a lot of money.I just bought a Dell - its much better.","I have been setting up dell laptops for my company\u0027s IS department pretty much ever day for the last month so that is my main point of reference.First of all I really like the touch pad.","I tried dell and hp, but there was no way to get this kind of configuration for this price.","I priced this a comparable on Dell and a few other model and either way you slice it this will cost north of $3,000.","So you can probably get more functionality/customizibality from a Dell for at or just under the price of this MB.","2 years later the monitor went out of it, so I went on line and ordered a 17\" Dell computer.","I\u0027m going back to Dell for now.","The Dell is cheaper and it has more memory.\"","I got this same notebook but model LX.A8605.470 which has a bigger hard drive, and more RAM.Pros: This notebook offers the same features of my Dell notebook for about $1000 less.","I have owned seven laptops over the past 20 years, and so when I searched to upgrade my 3-year old Dell (eight pounds!) I wanted power and mobility above all.","As much as I love Dell\u0027s service, I always encounter frustrating PC problems.","(compare the charger to those bulky Dell ones and you\u0027ll know what I mean).To any avid PC-user who is doubtful of being comfortable with this powerbook, I\u0027ll just say \u0027go for it, you\u0027ll love it\u0027.","Plus I flashed the bios to the newest version.I already had an old Dell Latitude CP 233mhz that went bad, but the battery from it is a match to the one I bought + the AC power supply is compatible.","The Dell had been quite reliable, came with instructions, software, and one year free guarantee, but I dropped it and the lid was hanging by a thread so time to look for something else.","The back of the lid sports the Dell medallion (for lack of a better word).","Battery life isn\u0027t great (maybe 3 hours) but these systems blow away every Dell laptop I have purchased in the past three years for double the price.","I got this laptop a few weeks before,man this laptop rocks.I been using a lot of laptops recently \u0026 was looking for a perfect laptop for myself \u0026 finally got this one.the 14.1 inch wide screen,fingerprint recognition,IBM,s Active protection system,ThinkVantage Technology and a lot of secure features are available with this.pros:14.1-inch Wide screen-untill now Thinkpadz are pretty Boxy \u0026 now they look cool with the new WideScreen look(Thanks for LENOVO for making this move).Inbuilt WI-FI wireless card which can access internet from anywhere in USA.its just like you Mobile phone.(but we need to get a contract with carriers like VERIZON who provides Wireless national broadband intenet.)1GB Ethernet Network card--grow people its 1GB internet access broadband.asusual we do have Bluetooth in this notebook.Wireless capability: This one got 802.11 a/b/g wireless,check this out this is 802.11a capable,so we can access internet at 100 Mbps if your wireless router supports one,We also have an inbuilt SD card reader \u0026 3 USB drives.Got DVD burner.Excellent finger-Print recognition software-Trust me the finger print software is simply amazing,other than that we can also store a lot of secure information at our finger tips with this software(IBM is the only one that started giving this on laptops,neverthless of the fact all the other companies like DELL,SONY are working out to include this feauture in their products).Active Protection system- this is a feature only available with IBM thinkpadz, your HD is enabled with a active shock protection system which protects your HD on shocks/shakes.","I have been using DELL, Toshiba, IBM and Panasonic laptops for the last several years and bought HP Laptops primarily to create diversity in my office after using other makes.","To call most Dell power supplies cheap far beyond worthless is to give too positive a spin on something truly bad.","Dell couldn\u0027t compete in terms of price/components, and HP is a disaster when it comes to customer service.","Thats one reason I didn\u0027t purchase DELL E1705.","In fact, I almost never use my new 24\" Dell screen.","A Dell power supply is lucky to last a year.","The machines I was primarily looking at were the dell 600m/d600, dell 700m, compaq v2000, and the averatec.","I will never buy another Dell product again and recommend that others who are not technically experienced with fixing computers or that need a \"mission critical\" system that they look elsewhere because Dell cannot be relied upon to fix broken systems in a timely manner.","I got tired of my old Dell Inspiron 8100 (P3 1.0 ghz) crashing on me and freezing up on me.","My advice, buy an Apple, their customer service is unmatched by any other I have experienced.I have 3 Dells, nearly all the same system.","It is like the Dell D610, but a little smaller.","Please do not purchase a Dell computer.","My wife complains about the keyboard and has difficulty typing on it vs our Dell laptop.","Since then, I have been using Windows machines (ThinkPad, Dell, Toshiba) for work and personal use.","I had many problems with Dell laptops (various Inspiron models) and had to call in support fairly often.","Just be wary when purchasing a Dell product.","I contacted Dell Technical Support via chat.","I then went to the Dell site and dowloaded and installed the necessary Drivers.I had absolutely no problems with the o/s install and the install of the drivers.","Darn... another 20 Bucks to Dell for a .99 cent piece of plastic.","About 5 months ago my own Dell laptop up and died (thank goodness for that) so I finally had an excuse to buy a new computer.","Last, Sony does not supply CD/DVD reinstall disks like Dell.","When I started college last year, I bought a Dell laptop that was pretty horrible.","Received this dell computer within 5 days (maybe less) Computer was very reasonably priced and upon receipt was very pleased with the condition on the computer.","Yeah, and did they think I was some dummy who would pay that?

My previous laptop - Dell Insipiron - took some windows configuration which if you\u0027re new to wireless connectivity could take awhile to get used to.","My work laptop - Dell Latitude D630 looks and feels like a Ford Pinto in comparison.","I have a averatec 5110H model laptop.PLEASE DONT BUY anything from averatec.The laptops monitor had a problem only after a week i bought.The customer service is VERY VERY bad.They take 2 weeks time to repair/replace anything.This is during the warranty period(1 yr).Thereafter,if anything goes wrong you have to ship it back to them,as they dont sell any of their parts outside.Now, this time they took 4 weeks time to repair.Compare this with DELL/MAC.its a 3 days reponse time.","It has way more style than anything Toshiba, or Dell is offering.","It\u0027s certainly as physically pretty as anything that Apple has to offer, and as far as I can tell, Sony designed this notebook to attract Apple customers (it\u0027s certainly a big style improvement over clunky Dell and IBM computers).","All because you have to press the keyboard all the way down and it is not that sensitive compared to IBM, DELL or MAC laptops I have used.","Last December I made the switch from a Dell X300 PC laptop to my first Apple computer, a Powerbook G4 12\".","Also, I comparison shopped with a very similar Dell PC (Dell Latitude D800), which initially looks better at under $1400...except once I added on the \"this and that\" to match the specs on this Toshiba, the Dell price rose upwards of $2800!! Wow, what a difference in price, huh?I am well aware of all the problems that could exist with this notebook; as I\u0027ve mentioned, LOTS of research time went into this purchase.","I LOVE this computer! After struggling for over a year with a Gateway M675 and a Dell Inspiron, and being dissatisfied with both, I went to the local Freys and checked out the HP DV2xxx series.","Oh yes, you do not get a manual with the unit, but you can download the manual at the Dell site.Edward J Keefer The Laptop was received in good condition, brand new zeal in it box, and everything that was described about it was found intact.","I was too poor to pay for an expensive computer and too impatient to wait for a Dell to be delivered, so I bought a Compaq Presario.","With the purchase of this ibook, however, all of my feelings about Apple\u0027s computers were reiterated and magnified.I feel that this review would be more meaningful if a comparison was drawn between the ibook and a similar high-end laptop offered by Dell (the Inspiron 600M Celeron) Please note that this is not a true comparison because the Dell Inspiron 600M has a 1.3ghz processor while the ibook (14\") has a 1.42ghz processor.The Dell Inspiron 600M at a price of $1,623:1.","I looked for HP, DELL, Fujitsu etc.","If one gives a family member something that doesn\u0027t work they may get slightly irritated.With his knowledge of his field and his wisdom of years of experience, He knew that I would appreciate this Dell Latitude.","My only previous PC laptop was a Dell Inspiron 1100 2.4Ghz, so that\u0027s what I can compare to.","I think I\u0027m going to go for an HP, Sony, or buy a Dell laptop instead.","You\u0027ll pay double for a comparable Dell.","(Seldom necessary unless you know what you want out of these.)The hardware of Sony Vaios is still made entirely in Japan, unlike your average IBMs or Dells (which are made in China or Malaysia.)","The power adaptor is also well engineered to be like a small bar, about one-third the size of the one for my dell D620.2.Despite the light weight, the construction feels very solid.","My next laptop will probably either be a Thinkpad or else a Dell XPS 1210.","In all my years of owning Apples and Dells, I NEVER experienced any thing approaching bad tech support as I have with HP.","I have been using portable computers for over 19 years since the Compaq luggable, and currently own the following notebooks :- Thinkpad T41- Sony VAIO K23- Dell Inspiron 5150- Apple iBook 12 inch- Thinkpad 600E- eMachines M6809 (another AMD - 64 bit Athlon)....so you will find this review very accurate and unbiased.First of all, this is an OUTSTANDING laptop for under $1,000.","It\u0027s not as limited as a Dell, as fragile as a sony nor does it warm up as a toshiba (and I\u0027ve had them all)..","We use Dell at work, and I found a great deal on a Dell at Costco.com.","I took the unit to a REAL Dell tech who put a wireless card in the unit and found the unit defective.","I wouldn\u0027t buy a laptop from anybody else, have always had a great experience with them.Personally I prefer a Toshiba Tecra S1, it has 32MB of dedicated video memory on a Radeon ATI card whereas this one has shared video memeory, and tons of different connections and expandability options.But still way better than some crappy HP or Compaq or Sony, my IT friends all report that those have the most repairs by far.Hint: buy extra memory from Dell, it\u0027s a snap to install yourself and will save you $$$.","I am a long-time user of Apple products but have got to say that I am so happy with my recently purchased iBook (12\", 1.2GHZ, 256MB RAM - Upgraded to 768 - running Panther 10.3.8) that I cannot be thankful enough.I was a Windows user for many years - since 3.1 - and the comparison between even modern windows machines (I purchased a custom Dell laptop recently for a boss and had to set it up for him so I have a very good comparison point) still comes down to the blessing that Apple is the designer of the hardware and OS.","I have no previous experience with HP system but I like it much much more than the Dell systems of the past several years.","Of course that is not a reflection on the laptop as much as it is on the battery - just get a better one or a spare one.Also need to warn buyers that what brings the price down markedly is the fact that it only comes (at least mine did) with a 6-monh trial of MS Word, Excel, \u0026 PowerPoint, but I solved this problem by backing up my 6-year-old Dell to a 300 gb Seagate external hard drive, and all those apps seem to run on the Satellite off the Seagate drive.","In some respects, I\u0027d rather not get a new one, as this one has performed so well!Two (bandaged) thumbs up! I almost bought a Dell XPS M1210.","We like the idea of everything being integrated, but the integration is an unachieved ideal, a fantasy.If I had to do it again, I\u0027d get the exchange computer Dell cheerfully offered when the first malfunctioned.","The sound is very poor and it\u0027s not that fast.I had a Dell 8100 before also a compaq and a IBM and all of them where faster to open the windows and responding to commands.If I was going to by it now I will by something else.","They now are a very happy Dell customer.","Relying on Dell customer service is a non issue with me.","It far exceeds my Dell notebook capabilities in sounds and graphics.","I had a Dell Inspiron before.","Similar heating problem was there with a Dell laptop (12.1\u0026quot; screen) that I had earlier.","I think i got a defective peice and luckily before one month only i could find out that otherwise i wouldn\u0027t have got my entire refund.Now i am about to recieve my refund as of Nov 2nd.I dont recommend this product as i was very big fan of Sony Viao and thinking that it will last for more time but for my it was very big disappointment.I have 2 dell laptops and i wanted one more for my brother so i ordered one more dell.","I would take my old dell P2 back in a heartbeat in trade for this thing.","Somebody knowledgeable told me this is true of TV reception on all computers; I wish I had known that before I bought this P25.I should mention that I had just previously sent back a Dell laptop with many of the same features because it was crashing and locking up out of the box.","The large screen makes surfing sweet and this laptop has FIVE harmon/kardon speakers so MP3s sound GREAT.So based on what I use my laptop for, my buying criteria was:-HD DVD player (preferably a SuperMulti)to watch HD DVDs and burn mps and photo and video DVDs-Minimum 2 GB of Ram which helps speed up processing times-HD drive of at least 120 GB for large amounts of photo and mp3 files-Duo processor with at least 1.8 GHZ to speed up batch processing of photo files-SD card reader for easy transfer of my photos files from my camera.I looked first, of course, at Dell, then looked here at Amazon.","It\u0027s also extremely light, making for easy transport.The only feature that I miss from my Dell laptop is the ability to extend the screen to an 180 degree angle.Overall, if your looking for a great work/play combination in a laptop, look no further.","I had a 15\" Dell Inspiron laptop that just went out of its extended warranty, and I wanted to buy another laptop on MY terms, rather than scrambling to get a new one when something bad happened to the Dell.","But I\u0027m sure other models of Dell would do better.It almost never crashes, and has never gotten a virus.","My next laptop will probably be a Dell, because their batteries last nearly 3 hours and are much cheaper.","I can tell a slight improvement over the HP (Core Duo), but a huge one over the Dell (Centrino 2.0).","And with such a light laptop, you don\u0027t get the main problem I had with my Dell (twice the weight): lap numbness, caused by excessive weight, and the intense heat.","Dell doesn\u0027t have that haha.I would recommend this computer to anyone.","My fingers are crossed to see what happens next.I\u0027ve owned several Toshibas, Dells, IBM, etc but this one has been the fastest to go completely on the blink I loved this laptop when I first purchased it one year ago.","I did about a month of research (between Sony, Dell, and HP) and this laptop was up against a 17\" HP Pavilion with a 10-key.","Do yourself a solid and invest in a Dell XPS of any model.","My Dell Laptop from work has a crappy battery - lasts 1 hour max when not plugged in and gets hot.","Price may not be worth it at this point in time, seeing as how other manufactures like Dell have yet to release their Vista-solutions.","I have had dell, hp and sony laptops before and i must admit the best was the hp.","I bought an extra power supply for my office work station and keep one at home as well.The only con I\u0027ll offer is that the iBook doesn\u0027t readily support Outlook, which I used to live within in the Dell days.","I recommend a Dell or something until Apple gets its act together.","I bought a PowerBook 12\u0026quot; 867MHz about nine months ago, had a brief fling with a Dell that my work issued me, and went back to the Mac.","If you are in IT, then please do everything in your power to pull major Compaq contracts, and support bids by IBM and Dell so that we can put this horrible company out of business.","It is much faster than a 2 year old Dell workstation I have as a desktop unit.","I\u0027ve had a DELL (hate that company) Inspiron 1100 that I\u0027ve had for two years and the speed seemed about the same.","A dell machine of similar price would be falling apart in many, many, more critical ways (I should know I used to work in a computer lab), and compaq\u0027s/hps are infinitely worse machines.","I was given this computer to replace a constantly-overheating Dell XPS generation 1 since it was still under warranty with Dell.","Wouldn\u0027t recommend to switch to Vista without at least 2 GB of RAM.Cons: It get\u0027s slow loading windows and all the programs that start when you log in, battery life not as good as my old Dell Inspiron 6000.","But now-a-days with all of the viruses and spyware that is plaguing the horrible \u0027Windows\u0027 operating system, I just don\u0027t understand why people still put of with Microsoft\u0027s crappy Windows OS.Anyways, the price might be a little more expensive than say a Dell or a Gateways but look at the reliabitlity of owning a Mac.","Dell running with its larger capacity battery gets over 5 hours of battery, just to compare.Weight - heavier than it looks.","I have a wireless network at my home and at school, and the Powerbook gets a much better reception all around than the Dell Inspiron ever did.Lastly, there\u0027s the coolness factor.","Why spend $1200 on a new laptop that doesn\u0027t do much more than a 4 year old one? I\u0027ve started to use this notebook in replacement of a Dell Latitude.","If you price up a Dell or Sony....or pretty much any brand with the same hardware, I guarantee the price will be WELL OVER 2gs.","in fact there are no ports on the back at all, aside from the power plug.One thing I hated about my Dell was that the DVD bay button was always accidently getting opened, the button was too soft and big so when i picked up the laptop, i\u0027d end up popping the drive door.","Design: Simple and smart (Kind of mixture of Dell and Sony) I bought this for my grandson even though it has a smaller screen and is twice as expensive as a windows machine.","I was also considering the 13\" MacBook Pro and the Dell XPS15z.","And the craftsmanship, including the keyboard, so far surpasses Dell that the earlier reviewer\u0027s assertion to the contrary seems inexplicable.","I bought a top of the line Dell, and although my experience wasn\u0027t terrible, I couldn\u0027t wait to get back to using a Mac.","Nonetheless, I knew in a profound way that, in the comfort of my own home, there was no way I was going to be using a Dell running Windows.","I paid $3K for my Dell XPS with all the trimming but I found its to big \u0026 heavy to drag around everywhere I go.Second, apparently the Toshiba S5002 is discontinued.","When it comes time to order a new computer, I will probably look at either a Dell or Alienware and pay extra.","NMI, memory parity error.Dell is coming next week to replace my motherboard and GPU amd RAM.The performance is very good in gaming, but reliablity is subpar.Update: at 16 months, no display, Dell is going to replace motherbaord again.","part of me is wishing i\u0027d blown another [money] for a beefier dell -- would\u0027ve gotten a bigger hard drive than 20gb, a faster video card, s-video out, and stuff like that.","about the left click thing all you have to do is push ctrl along with the botton and it will left click!anyway i love it! I am 40, and have used more than a dozen luggable Windows computers, laptops, and notebooks in my career from several manufacturers: (Toshiba, Dell, Gateway, IBM...).","Instead, this is just mediocre and not as good as Dell (and I don\u0027t have a great opinion of Dell).","I have been using a M405 laptop for over 5 years at work, have turned down new Dell systems because I am happy with my Gateway.","My Dell was on the dim side--even being a \u0027truebrite\u0027 model.","My other choice would have been a Dell Inspiron, but having compared the two, I\u0027m confident I made the right choice.","Had Dell for a long time, so i thought i\u0027d try something different.","I will not purchase any Sony products in the future in general and would recommend Dell for laptops - their service is good.","you can easily find a cheaper one in dell or lenovo.My ratings(out of 5 star):keyboard: *****weight: *****screen: ****OS: ***price:**durability: ** ( This is a guess as I havent spent enough time yet) All aspects of getting this computer went seamlessly.","It spanks the Dells I have to use at school, both in terms of usability and in terms of raw power.","Sony, Apply, Dell also have had the same problems yet they did a recall and treated their consumers with respect.","The large medallion like silver Dell logo on the lid cover looks nice.","My Dell at work is a solid machine! Not bad for windows based computer.","I have a new Dell Inspiron 6000 that has many more features and a great LCD screen, but just feels cheap in comparison.","No more Dells for me.","This applies to 90% of all notebooks, particularly the cheaper ones, even Apple\u0027s (yes, Macs are PCs unless you\u0027ve been brainwashed).With an additional 1 GB this computer was a good deal for around 600 bucks and it worked as well as any computer with Vista can for about a year; then one single major problem plus the normal vicissitudes of anything made by Microsoft have taken the experience to new lows.The problem is that all 4 USB ports suddenly stopped working, and nothing has been able to solve that - not reinstalling the video drivers, not reinstalling Vista from scratch, not fiddling with and updating the BIOS, not even installing Ubuntu Linux; Toshiba\u0027s site and software updates are pathetic and their customer service nonexistent; and other manufacturers are at the same level or even lower - HPs are a major no-no, Dells are generic, Sonys have a better hardware record but at unreasonable premiums.Interestingly enough everything else is working as it should so I got a PCMCIA (carbus) Adaptec card with an additional 2 USB ports like this oneAdaptec USB2CONNECT for Notebooks 1420V.","Sony sells the most expensive computer you can buy and provides the worst customer service you will find.Do yourself a favor and buy HP, Toshiba, Dell, or anything besides Sony.","My wife used one and now doesn\u0027t want to touch my Dell laptop.","I had become quite comfortable with my Dell and was not looking forward to parting with it, but the portability of a notebook computer had become a necessity since I travel back and forth to college at least twice a year.","As it comes it is an awesome deal in today\u0027s market will run rings around many laptops in the same price range.In case you missed it through all the techie talk, buy this laptop!Dell Latitude C640 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 256MB/60GB/CD Drive Notebook Computer I have owned the Toshiba Satellite P205-S6237 for three years and still love it.","DELL should definitely think about adding numeric keypad on its 17\u0027\u0027 laptops.7.","Now the large widescreens are mass produced and even Walmart has Dell desktop-replacement laptops.After much searching the only options with a screen size less than 17 inches and under $2k were Sony Vaio, Lenovo (thinkpad replacement) and the 13 inch macbook.","After reviewing offerings from Dell, Ibm, HP and IBM determined that for the money the Toshiba was the best if my budget was less than $2000.Good features: (1) speed, (2) everything works, (3) good screen; (4) very good video card, I run the native screen plus a 24\" dell monitor with no problem.Poor features: Keyboard layout is strange.","For my Dell laptop, if I ever had to reinstall the drivers for the printer, I\u0027d have to go to HP\u0027s website, download a 50MB file, then go through the whole installation process (which seemed to screw up half the time anyway) before I could print anything.","The N3000 is much more like a Dell than the Thinkpad.","This laptop is more portable than other 14.1-inch laptops I considered such as Dell 1405 because Gateway managed to fit the 14.1 inch screen in a smaller case without sacrificing features.","The following are the pros and cons...Pros...+ Super simple set-up -- took me less than half an hour to open the box, configure the system, and establish an internet connection through my home-based, WEP enabled 802.11g wireless network+ Stunning graphics display (1200 X 800 resolution is awesome!)+ Lightening fast handling of MS office applications (a 60 day trial version of MS office -- Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint is pre-loaded)+ Fit and finish are BMW-like (i.e., high speed, low drag)+ Extremely nice touch for Sony to have preloaded a decent anti-spyware application (SpySubtract)and Norton Security (3 month trial version)+ A couple reviewers have maligned the 128 MB Intel graphics card, but using an idependent test site (pcpitstop.com), the graphics card received extremely high marks+ Over-all configuration/performance are similar to machines costing several hundred more (somewhat unusal for a premium brand like Sony)+ Keyboard action is sweeeet -- so is the big and fat 100GB hard drive (can\u0027t ever imagine having the content to fill it up!)+ Comsumer\u0027s Union (publisher of Consumer Reports) continually gives Sony high marks for build qualityCons...+ Sony\u0027s knucklheaded bean-counters decided to save money by equipping the machine with a 7 foot power cord -- I have never (and I mean never ever) seen a machine in this price tier come with such a short powercord (my Dell that I use for work came with a 12 foot powercord); I now have to make a 2nd trip to the store to rectify this albiet small, but nevertheless disappointing shortcoming+ I am surprised that the built in speakers are just this side of acceptable (that\u0027s okay as I live for searching Amazon for fun peripherals!)+ I am also somewhat surprised that there are so few hot (a.k.a. quick connect) buttons for multi-media and internet apps (just two!) -- many other machines come with half a dozen or more+ Would like to see more free software preloaded (this seems to be an issue with most of Sony\u0027s machines: laptop and desktop; high end and low end)+ Touch pad takes a little getting used to (not quite sensitive enough at the default setting)Hope this helped with your search for a new machine! Never again will I buy anything Toshiba.","I bought a dell notebook from them and within a couple of weeks I had to send it back because it kept crashing.","Just can\u0027t get enough of the stability and intuitiveness of Mac OS X compared to XP or Vista (I was using Vista for a few weeks too) and frankly speaking, Vista is a good copy of OS X but still has a lot to do.Bundled applications - iLife 06 is great (compared to all those junk that Dell gave me)4.","I have had very good experience with Dell: 3 Laptops they were all great.","The dell came in. great shape and arrived about the days before scheduled.... but the battery life sucks!..it won\u0027t hold a charge for an hour...ready a stay at home laptop...lol .overall tho it was a great buy very cheap so I guys you get what you pay for The dell computer I recieved was in very good condition although it has a minor scratch it is nothing to be upset about.","I bought this Sony after owning a Dell Inspiron laptop with XP loaded for 5 years.","I\u0027ve used notebooks from Dell and IBM for years and this is the first Apple Notebook I\u0027ve used for my business.","I recently gave my Dell Inspiron to my parents and bought a macbook after harboring much antagonism towards Macs.","I would certainly purchase from this seller again!! I have to say that thanks to this laptop I am now a true believer in HP products! All of my desktops have always been Dells, but this laptop has converted me to HP for life.","Lots of useful features sold me on this machine over Dell or Compaq - built-in CDRW and network connection are great.","I have owned Toshiba and a Dell before and none of them have been as good to me as this one has.Pros: fast, plays 3-D games like they were meant to be played (much better than a celeron processor), good sound for a laptop (best i\u0027ve heard so far), very clear screen, plays cds and dvds fast, great multitasking capabilities, good battery life, and nice to look at.Cons: not the quietest machine-but it is not loud at all-just not quiet and it\u0027s a little on the thick side but it\u0027s also not as heavy as it looks.Overview: Great desktop replacement and good for taking it around sometimes (not ALL the time).","I looked at different laptop companies which include: Toshiba, HP, Compaq, Dell, Fujitsu, Gateway, Sony, Macintosh (out of my price range).I hope that this review has helped you make up your mind on choosing a laptop.","When I finally got to the point where I could deal with this computer again, I contacted Dell to return it.","Adios, Dell! My laptop arrived quickly and in perfect condition.","My tired ole\u0027 Acer 2223W VGA flat screen looks somehow better than it did running externally off of my Dell XPS, if that\u0027s possible.","Our 2.5 GHz Dell computers at school don\u0027t even stand a chance.The OS is solid, and with little features like Expos\u0026eacute;, it just makes life a lot easier when taking notes and research at the same time.","Also the batteries of many of these Powerbooks have been recalled (Dell and many other companies have had to deal with similar recalls).Leopard is going to be released soon and due to the robust videocard (at the time at least for such a small computer such as this) I will be able to view the newest version of OS X with all of the Core Image eye-candy intact.2 and a half years- no virus infections, no spyware, no adware.","It has 4 USB 2.0 ports on the right side so adding a mouse is no problem.Pros:Price vs Features (although it has gone up since I bought it), Processor Speed, HD Display Screen, HD Size, SuperMulti DVD player, Biometric reader, 6 USB 2.0!!!, all ports are on front and sides for easy access, attractive case, numeric pad on keyboard, rich sounding speakers, runs cooler on the bottom then my Dell laptops (heat is vented to the sides)Cons:Weight, AC Adapter converter is the size of a brick!, price of buying a second adapter is expensive.UPDATE: A couple of things.","My hard drive on my dell desktop literally self consumed and died during a standard defrag.","If you compare Dell and Thinkpad with identical models, you probably won\u0027t be able to see the difference across the brand new items.","(Make sure you have a home computer that you can synch up with often, to keep this machine from being too cluttered.)\u003d\u003d [A note about Dell] \u003d\u003dI have bought about 8 Dell machines over the years (for myself or as gifts).","I ended up paying just over $2000 which is a crazy investment for a college student but I know that its resale value will stay high and it will last me much longer than my previous HP and Dell notebooks.","I researched this problem and found MANY other people who had posted the same problem (many people mention it is a 17\" Dell problem).","Of course there are other good Centrino systems out there, but for my money it\u0027s a Sony, followed closely by Dell.","Originally I was going to purchase a Dell Inspiron.","I recently handed down my clunky 4 year old Dell Dimension desktop and heeded the advice of a computer geek I knew back in college, \"If you\u0027re going to buy a PC laptop, get a Toshiba.\"","BEWARE of this product,the screen damages easily and is not covered by sony\u0027s warranty-it will cost you up to $500 to have it repaired on top of the$2000 it cost originally.I am of course worried that this will happen again in the future andI continue to carry my Dell with me wherever I go.SONY HAS ANOTHER PROBLEM THE SIZE OF IT\"S BATTERY PROBLEM AND WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS SOON Beware.","It is my first Apple Computer, and when my Dell XPS dies, I intend on replacing it with an Apple PC.","Not once did the DELL stop working for no reason or break because I touched the LCD screen.After 2 weeks of fighting with SONY........probably a GOOD 15 hours total on the phone, it was finally decided that they would NOT FIX THE LCD SCREEN, but they would get the computer to start working again.","It\u0027s Good beacause it\u0027s cheap And it\u0027s a dell and it\u0027s a laptop Its good I would recommended it.great for the price and in great condition you should buy it.screen was good not a scrach on it It\u0027s great and it has very fast loading it looks just like the Mac book but I wouldn\u0027t watch movies on it.","It\u0027s sleek, thin and light, a huge contrast to any Dell and especially HP/Compaq.","Horrible customer service!

It is cheaper than a Dell or HP configured in a similair fashion and looks cooler as well.","Install Windows and insert the driver CD and you\u0027ve got a Windows laptop, just as if you had purchased a Dell or other PC.","I\u0027ve used Dells all my life and have suddenly realized they aren\u0027t all that great and there are other options out there.","Dell sold me a laptop that was incompatible with docking station and stand; replaced docking station and stand but still didn\u0027t work.","Even when I was staying up all weekend \u0027til 3AM trying to migrate enough of my Dell XPS stuff to use the MBP at work on Monday, it was not as tooth-grinding an exercise as it might have been if I was moving just from one Windows laptop to another.","Still, undaunted by the good reviews, I searched Dell, Sony and all the other Windows laptop makers.","I have no doubt that today\u0027s buyer can do better at Dell or Gateway, or, for the traveler on a budget, at Averatec.","Extended and personalized warranty options, LOCAL service centers (neither Dell or Sony has that...) and training for those people that aren\u0027t as computer savvy as they would like to be.","Price: $400 cheaper than Dell 700m, which is the cheapest among rival big guys such as Sony and Toshiba.2.","If you want to upgrade, DELL has an easy flip open case, snap open parts and then... oops the DELL proprietary hard drive caddy for the second new Serial ATA drive you got for dirt cheap off of Frys isn\u0027t in there! And there\u0027s no easy way to mount the drive otherwise (unless you want to drill a few holes...)","I used to have a Dell and I hated it.","And I won\u0027t get started on the whole Dell customer service aspect.","My Dell B130 works well as any other Dell I have had on the past (about 4) - However, I know its keyboard will fail within 1 year or so.","Yes it does cost a lot compared to a similarly equipped Dell.","I needed to replace my 6-year-old Dell Inspiron 7000 that was just getting too clunky and trouble-prone, the main problem being it took a full 15 minutes to start up.","I started from a Dell 3200, continue into a 6500, and finally switched to a Thinkpad five years ago, starting from a X21, T23, and eventually T42.","It also feels solid enough, and battery life is good - it can play a dvd at full brightness for about 1.6 hours.The problem, however, is that it is SLOW - its slower than my 6 year old 1.7ghz desktop with 512 memory and it is slower than my wifes 2.0 ghz 5 year old dell notebook with 256mb memory.I\u0027m not sure if it is vista that makes it slow (I\u0027m pretty sure it is) - but be warned this is a pokey slow machine.","I had a Dell for about 4 years and it finally died after a not-so-good life so I was definitely ready to have a real excuse to get a new computer.","The dvd drive is a excellent feature and more of a added bonus but the cd burner is an awsome little burner and usful for on the spot recording (I\u0027m a broadcast student).The bundle software I am never a big fan of but it does include some very handy software such as money 2003,Intervideo 2004 and Works those just a few but the ones I use the most.The techincal support is the best support team out there they will speak english to you instead of computer lingo and will accaully be nice when the costumer is getting upset.I have use Sony\u0027s tech support on and off for the last three years and they truely know how to treat their costumers with kindness.I would say comparing to the computers I have used in my life (Hewitt Packard,Dell and Gateway) you are getting more for the money when you purchase a Sony Vaio.","My dell laptop cost me around 500 and its brand new, has way more to offer then that.Amazon obviously thinks people are willing to pay that price for it and they obviously want you to pay that price because after all...their Advertizing it for that price....So they must be really crazy about trying to sell the trash because very obviously....TRYING TO SELL THIS ITEM MAKES AMAZON LOOK VERY BAD.","A big advantage over DELL E1705 which really looks big to me.","I\u0027ve used Dell business-class (Lattitude) notebooks since the 90\u0027s, and bought one of these for my wife as a replacement for her iMac.","Initially it gave me around 1.5 hr and now it\u0027s giving around 35 minutes...10) It\u0027s too costly...You may save around 500 $ if you buy a better laptop (like Dell).I bought this only for the brand name Sony.","I researched between another Dell and the VAIO and it seemed I was getting a better deal with the Sony (VAIO\u0027s good reputation and on sale at Circuit City for about $850) so I bought it in March 07.","Unfortunately, the M1210 is butt ugly, heavier than it should be, and when he got it, he had to spend a bunch of time on the phone with Dell to get it to work properly.","The price is around 700 for such laptop.I think it was the best.i have used HP, dell emachines, toshiba on the same price level.I think this one is better.","I had a DELL laptop for 4 years and touched it on many occasions and NEVER EVER had a problem.","Amazon has a folding Bluetooth keyboard for $29 which is a great option for this machine.Audio is impressive, nice and loud.Wifi is great, it connects much faster than my Dell XPS notebook and never drops a signal.The device boots in under a minute and wakes from sleep in around 12 seconds (including connecting to wifi).The screen is perfect; great resolution and extremely bright and sharp.Heat is an issue.","That\u0027s when I realized that the shared-memory video card inside the Dell would never, ever play a 3D game like Half-Life 2 with any kind grace.","The Dell power supplies in question did not slowly die they just up and quit no warning of nothing.","I tried the same kind of work on my old Dell Inspiron - it does crash sometimes but can be recovered by pressing CTL-ALT-DEL (never freezes like Compaq does), thus you rarely loose your unsaved work.","The one time I was able to make my Dell show weakness was when I installed Half-Life 2 on it.","Personally I don\u0027t know a lot about computers I own a Dell desktop and I taught myself how to use it.","And best part is no fan/CPU noiseNegative point: From sides it looks bit bulkyThis was a great deal compared to Sony Lenovo or Dell.","I have used Dells, Gateways, Fujitsus and Panasonic Toughbooks.","Much more durable than the Dell.","it was more expensive than the titanium and the dell (d600), but after using mine for about twenty four hours now, i can honestly say you get what you pay for.","I purchased this laptop as a replacement for my 5 year old Dell, which died n me suddenly, as I was getting ready to head out of town for a series of meetings.","I really feel as though I am in a BMW or Range Rover Vogue whilst my brother next to me on his Dell is getting by in a Hyundai.First of all, the boot time is crazy.","I never had this problem with Dell.","i read a lot of reviews and was thinking of returning this but it worked alot better then i thought it would had it almost 3 months withou a problemthe wireless signal strenght was not good out of the box but once i updated through windows update it doubled and i am getting the same signal as my dell picture is great very fast cpu does not get as hot as i thought it would very light and appealingonly bad thing is definitly the speakers I read a lot of reviews on the Web complaining about MacBook Air single USB port, lack of built-in Ethernet port, external SuperDrive, etc. as major issues...","In my opinion IBM\u0027s are much more sturdy than a Dell or Compaq.","As far as I am concerned, Dell is lucky that I would buy any product.","However, in April Dell introduced the Latitude D620 which is about 1/2 pound heavier than this machine and is better equipped at a lower price (DELL gives you Win XP Pro and you can configure it to have 2GB RAM.","After dealing with Dell for many years, I decided to take a chance on the Averatec AV3220H1.","Just for fun, I ran the same program on a fully loaded Dell 820 ($3000), and it finished in about 3 minutes.","Considering companies like Dell or Toshiba can fix their computers in under a week, this is wayyyy too long.Overall, the computer feels a little flimsy.","This model is nice when you see or compare with other brand styles such as Compaq, Dell, or so on.","Its better than the dell she previously had.","I thought this would make my mac much faster than my Dell Inspiron which has 1.24 GB of RAM.","My old Dell on the other hand is a different story.","I owned several Dell laptops and was a little apprehensive in buying a Sony brand.","I was concerned about how many reviews I have seen complain about how hot they get, but I don\u0027t think this gets any hotter than the Dell laptops I have used.","My Dell only gave me 2 hours on a good day (screen brightness down, just typing, wifi turned off).","Dell laptops have better keyboards.3.","Better go for Dell or IBM.","Its better than my dell d600 laptop which has 512mb 30gb also 1.6ghz processor and it dosent even come close to this ibook this is GREAT I just got this computer yesterday.","This never happens with the Dell.","I\u0027ve been shopping around for months for a full-featured compact laptop and it seemed like I was always trading off weight and size for features.After comparing laptops from the big boys (Dell, Compaq, HP, Sony), I decided on an Averatec laptop because it had the best price for the size and all the features I wanted.It\u0027s so light that it\u0027s a breeze to carry around between work, school, home and on the plane.","My Dell was fine for all those things.","I\u0027ve had zero problems with it.I did load bookcamp from apple (free) and installed windows for the one program I can\u0027t run in mac os x (Quickbooks) and I swear it runs windows better than any Dell I\u0027ve used.","Portability- Previous dell was okay but this one is only 4.3Lb.","This will make your laptop way faster.Also My sister got a DELL just when i got my Hp-keep in mind i am 16 no job and had to pay for laptop myself- i don\u0027t know how i did it but i did it-700 bucks after rebate.","There is also far too much bloatware installed on here - not neary as bad as Dell or Lenovo, but far more than I\u0027d prefer on a new system.The software used for the fingerprint login (\u0027biometrics\u0027) *works*, but it seems to crash once in awhile.","Both the 15\" and 17\" Macbook Pros have also been found to come with LCD panels that are only capable of displaying 6 bits of colour (certainly not in the \"millions\").If you are happy with spending $2.5 grand on a laptop with a display that is par for a $900 Dell, this laptop is meant for you, but if you do need a good display for your work, you would be better served switching back to Windows and buying a PC laptop instead.","I currently run two Dell desktops at my house on a wireless network, and the PB links up w/o a problem.","You still need to keep in mind that this thing is integrated so you cant customize its hardware in any way(Dell and Gateway), so basically forget about high performance games since you cant change it graphics card.","Laptop seems light for one with a 15.4 display (seems lighter than a hp and dell i have with the same display size).","It works great with the macbook and the dell.","I know this wouldn\u0027t be the case for Dell\u0027s, cos I dropped one of those at work once at 0 mph from a couple feet and it was completely ruined.","Its battery life is actually about 2 hours longer than my dell laptop I bought last year.","Having already been using Vista Easy Transfer and OneCare backups for several months, getting my settings onto the new laptop was a breeze, and I was up and running in just a couple of hours (with all files right where I left them no less).I have noticed that the Vaio is considerably faster than my old Dell, and with the dual core processor, it very seldom maxes out the resources, even while browsing the web, reading email, building a spreadsheet, and modifying CAD drawings all at the same time (usually in to 35-60% range).","And, oh yes--the WiFi range is outstanding! Beats my other two laptops handily! (How\u0027d they do that?)If you need a small, fast, and really bright-screened laptop that is much cheaper than the Sony\u0027s, or the Dell XPS 1210, this just might be it.","The wireless is a snap and works good, too.Compared HP, Compaq, Sony and Dell.","A negative factor is that in calling Toshiba support I had a 45 minute wait before I could speak to someone -- who was in fact knowledgeable and helpful.I\u0027m not overly dicomforted by the hot spot, which, in contrast to another reviewer, I do not think is related to the use of the cd drive.The only competition that comes close to this unit that I have seen is Dell, which at a sale price is in the range of the Toshiba.All in all, this is a good purchase and I can recommend it.","Even though the Vaio is much newer my old Dell is much better on battery usage and somehow the processor does not seem to be much slower than my Centrino!I am a network administrator and use this machine extensively while travelling through 8 states for my company locations and the dell is the only machine that ever comes with me.Highly suggested for an inexpensive and not top-of-the-line purchase but definately max out the RAM.","I, also, have a G4, Apple IBook ,1.2 Ghz, and a Dell Latitute Centrino, 1.6Ghz.","At the time of writing, Dell was offering an Inspiron 1300 through their Small Business unit about $650 with the following specs:Pentium M 735 (1.7GHz/400MHz FSB), Windows XP Home, 14.1\" WXGA display, 512mb DDR2 SDRAM, 40GB HDD, CD-RW/DVD Combo, Wifi.Not an astounding machine by any stretch, but illustrative at exposing just how misleading, disingenuous, and paltry this \"75%\" deal is.","Why most families will choose to buy a new laptop/desktop from Dell every two to three years? The old model can\u0027t perform tasks decently in around two years.","I ordered a refurbished D600 from Dell Financial Services 3 years ago.","However, as far as power goes, the SZ can do it all.The only computer that compares is the brand new Dell XPS 1330.","This includes the well known Dell.","VAIO and DELL owners in the office are green with envy.","Weighing in around about 5.5 pounds, it slides into my school bag and works perfectly in my classes with the power to run all the documents and presentations I need, still play games and watch youtube and videos, and for a older machine, runs much faster than my room mates Compaq Presario that\u0027s only four months old that has experienced several crashes and thats with all the modern options and with Vista operating systems over my XP Pro.Some Pro\u0027s I\u0027ve noticed with the Latitude: Reliable performance, very nice clear display, excellent processing speed, comfortable design in the keyboard, parts for this puppy are cheap and easy to come by...Some irritating little cons that keep this from being a five star would include: The dual mouse design can be irritating, touch sensitivity in the touch pad can sometimes open and close windows at random...Otherwise I have a high level of satisfaction with the Dell Latitude C600 and were I to get into a pinch again and needed another computer for some odd reason, I wouldn\u0027t hesitate in purchasing another C600 to fill the need.","Once I had set up the computer, I found a very helpful Dell Help book on the computer itself.","I just got my Dell d620 Latitude four days ago and I love it.","I always wanted that kind of laptop, Dell Inspiron 9100.","My girlfriend has a Dell that is 2 years younger, cost $250 more (350 counting the education discount) and is much heavier and slower.","On my work Dell laptop, it takes a couple of minutes to boot up and log into Windows.","lots of non-universal binary seems to run better with more RAM... the 512MB I believe is absolutely the minimum requirement and 1GB is ideal or max it out if you can afford itSave your work often in case the non-universal binary software might crash on youBattery life isn\u0027t great so carry your charger... it\u0027s very compact and will pretty much fit anywhere without being a burdenOverall about 4 stars and I think it\u0027ll get much better once all software becomes universal binary... it\u0027s still better than the Dell I use to own and I would purchase it again if I could.","We\u0027ve had it for three weeks now, and I want one for myself! I had really enjoyed my Dell XPS M1730.","Upon opening it up however, I immediately noticed a contrast to my Dell 700m.","That one also had the keyboard problem and had a line of bad pixels down the center of the screen.Additionally, the software the comes with it for managing power settings and profiles is terrible, the speakers are nearly unusable for watching a movie (distortion and low volume), and the included battery started to show drasticly lower life after about a year.I\u0027ve had a lot of Dells and while they\u0027re not perfect, I\u0027d buy one of them or a MacBook instead at this point.","The bad thing is the power outlet is on the right side as opposed to the back (like most IBMs)Bottom oine: a solid basic laptop computer, good for beginners as a field service engineer carrying a tool box, manuals, parts and that brick of a dell laptop every where.","What do you know SSH is there out of the box.Within minutes, I had downloaded eclipse, set up an SSH tunnel to my office and was working on the same Java application that I had been working on my Dell.","It is way lighter and slimmer than my friend\u0027s Dell.","The best way to spell it out is to compare it to my other two notebooks (which were a Compaq and a Dell):- The iBook consistently goes to sleep when I close the lid.- I only need to reboot the iBook an average of once per 5 weeks.- Program crashes are about 80% less than they were with the Windows notebooks.- You can install and uninstall programs on the iBook without them leaving remnants in the registry or other drags on your system.- No viruses or spyware issues.Highly recommended! I\u0027ve got friends with this (I personally have a 15\u0026quot; PowerBook) machine, and it\u0027s great.","I contacted Dell Technical Support via chat once again.","Go Dell!Compaqs are cheap and unreliable.","The Dells would connect and intermittently drop the connection every hour.","Also my wife has an Apple Powerbook G4, 15\" model.So I had the following goals for a replacement laptop to my Inspiron 1100:a) Lighter than the 7.5lb Dell.","Boy, do I miss the Dell support.","I have no doubt that today\u0027s buyer can do better at Dell or Gateway, or, for the traveler on a budget, at Averatec.","Try a DELL and forget the IBM/Lenovo.","When I open it up, I get the password screen, but after I enter the password, the screen goes blank, the machine stops responding and the only thing I can do is the age-old \u0026lt;Ctrl\u003e\u0026lt;cmd\u003e! Oddly enough, I had the same problem on my HP, so I wonder if it is an Intel special :-)I do not like the sharp edge around the machine - almost all PC notebooks that I have used in the past - Acer/HP/Toshiba/Lenovo/Dell have designed this better.","However, one or two years later, you will notice the Dell is getting up and running slower, the fan is making louder noise, and the bottom is getting extremely hot.","The product has many extras I didn\u0027t expect: a PC modem in a double PC slot, a handsome Dell carrying case, a Dell manual installed on the computer, and others.","On the other hand, it has a big, bright screen (even at half-brightness) and decent keyboard, and its good looks will beat out the Dells and Gateways others have to live with.","I don\u0027t notice my friends with DELL or IBM making this much noise.","I was looking at the Dell X1 initially but it doesn\u0027t have a PC card slot for wireless Broadband EVDO (plus gets only 3hrs battery life).","I had many choices lined up: Dell, Fujitsu, Gateway.","I purchased this to remedy a terrible overheating problem with my Dell Latitude.","The response is fast and crisp (my daughter\u0027s Dell 2200 -- same price range -- sometimes misses my taps and I have to repeat the process).BatteryHere is a shortfall for your mobile-madness types.","If IBM could only compete price and service with Dell desktops we would finally have a computer hardware war.","Had a Dell notebook and found it mostly useless, this notebook rivals most desktops on the market.Pros...wireless G networking, nice size hard drive, nice screen size, firewire, hyper-threading P4 @2.8 GHz, DVD-RWCons: Graphics card, bulky, battery life, keyboardGraphics card is good for your average+ user, this notebook is BIG in size \u003d not for a traveler,keyboard takes some getting used to, great for desktop replacement...just awesome.","It\u0027s not an issue related to my wireless network, because the Dell and several other computers have NO problem linking to and working on the wireless network for several hours at a time.Second: the screen seems to be \"dimmer\" than a normal screen, and as another user said it \"leaks\" light around the edges, so that the center of the screen is bright but not as bright as it could or should be.As a replacement for my ancient Dell computer, it\u0027s a nice upgrade, but I will definitely be more cautious about buying a used machine next time.","It seems to be able to transfer files twice as fast as my Dell that is a few years newer.","I havent got my dell yet, i mean its still in the us, i am in venezuela, but i heard the best coments about dell, even though i have a question... whats the difference between INTEL CORE 2 DUO and INTEL CORE DUO 2, because mine says intel core duo 2x1.6.","The Dell is lightyears beyond the IBM in every way.","Dell, Gateway, etc.)The Bad:-You\u0027ll read this everywhere, but the machine gets quite hot underneath.","(3) The wireless capabilities don\u0027t seem to always be up to par with my old Dell but it works well 99.93% of the time.Comparatively: I previously owned a heavy, chunky Dell Inspiron and after having to replace three batteries on the Dell and scratching the screen (from frequently grabbing it with one hand and piling textbooks on it), I bought this.","It scored a 2207 on the HDD bench, versus 3156 for the M35 which has a 60GB 5400RPM.It has JBL pro speakers, which is better than most laptops i have used over the year and pretty much surpasses most of Dells laptop speakers.","So far I have used HP, Sony, Dell and toshiba laptops, and unfortunately toshibas are the worst quality laptops after dell.","I just purchased a Dimension 310 and got quite a few upgrades for a really great price (Direct from Dell).","Much better build quality than functionally-similar Dell units (which seem a bit weak mechanically, sort of cheap plastic appearance).Who should buy this machine:1.","Dell 17inch laptop looks a lot like a dumb next to this Sony.","And windows ultimate is not too bad either! Poor design; overall bad product - looks and feels cheap like any other Dell product - returned after 2 days.","I\u0027ve built several IBM/PC-based desktop systems, from my first 486DX266 to my most recent 3.04Ghz Dell rebuild (looks like a Dell, but doesn\u0027t quack like one).","But otherwise, the price is good and Toshiba\u0027s far, far superior to my last couple of notebooks (which were both Dells).","To load Firefox I had to download it on my Dell and thumb drive it over to her HP.","On my Dell I had a hodgepodge of software that didn\u0027t work together.","Although I am partial to Toshiba, I compared with Sony, HP, and Dell.","I would say this Dell Latitude D600 that I receive is a junk.","I suspect the previous reviewer works for Dell; how else to explain the partisan distortions? I\u0027ve had this notebook for a few months and it\u0027s the best I\u0027ve ever used.","I put up with my first Dell Latitude D600 for about a year before finally just throwing it away.","But what the Dell probably won\u0027t offer is the little things.","I was looking for a light and durable laptop with an affordable price.Actually, I liked to buy a 700m from Dell, but I\u0027m tired of wating for a good deal.","As for the screen size, having a 14\" widescreen is so much better than my Dell\u0027s 15\" non-widescreen.","Compared to our Dells, this computer is a rock-solid saint.Battery lasts a long time, plays DVD\u0027s, burns CD\u0027s that can be read by PC\u0027s.Reasonable price, great value.","And when you try to find that other program, you hit the wall.Now after a month, it is still light and still looking nice, still overheats, fan does not stop, hard drive grinds something God knows what, and the webcam is still being used by another application.I have had it with it and with Toshiba, I can return it, so I will as soon as I get another one, probably the Dell XPS.","Please note I\u0027m not an advocate for DELL they told me that 5% of the computers they send out they know have serious issues.","I was pleasantly supprised at the performance and features equalness between her machine and my refurbished [done by Dell - who then transferred it to a 3rd party] machine! I purchased one of these a few months after they came out.","Dell, Toshiba, etc...)","After some research, I was down to Toshiba M45-S331 and Dell 6000.","It makes my Dell Inspirion look like a piece of garbage.The only 2 minor complaints I have are: the bottom can get a little toasty while sitting in your lap and my dvd/cd drive is a little noisey.","This notebook Rocks!! My 2nd Dell notebook (Inspiron 8600) was a big letdown for me (was going to buy a HP prior to buying my 2nd Dell) and saw the HP dv6000t series in Laptop Magazine as one of the \"Best of the Best\" and let me assure you it is awesome (brought the dv6275t)! Nearly flawless from finish to performance, I only have two minor gripes, USB connections is on the side instead of the PC\u0027s rear (a personal gripe) and it has Window\u0027s Vista installed, its not bad, just weird getting used to! Otherwise, I highly suggest you take a look at this PC, its fast the WXGA screen looks great.","I had two Dell Power supplies die within just a few days of each other with no warning whatsoever.","Since this process took more than 21 days, Dell penalized me a 10% \"restocking\" fee and made me pay for shipping.","The thinkpad lasts much longer than the Dell\u0027s laptop.","I first tried building one on Dell, but it always ended up way out of my price range and didn\u0027t have nearly the capacity and ability this notebook has.","more than enough for me.If longer battery life is needed, HP/Compaq sells a 12 cell battery for about a hundred bucks that extends websurfing to about 4 hours.A note about HP/Compaq\u0027s support; in a nutshell, it\u0027s wonderful.I\u0027ve not needed them with these lappys, but in the past they\u0027ve bailed me out of more than one jam.They\u0027ve even gone so far as to replace out of warrenty parts under warrenty, HP/Compaq rocks.I\u0027d recommend HP/Compaq to anyone over Dell and Sony.","I believe that I bought too early.I have an Imac which is awesome, and receives an A+. Overall, I am pleased with the laptop after several months of usage, it replaced a Dell 8200, it sure looks a lot nicer than the Dell but I wouldnt say it is radically faster, except maybe for the hard disk, but it is just incrementally better re g-wireless, widescreen etc.","Dell computers always are good.","Luego de esa experiencia no volver\u0026eacute; a comprar port\u0026aacute;tiles HP, ahora he preferido Lenovo, Dell o Alienware, las cuales me han salido mucho mejores y m\u0026aacute;s estables.","Before purchasing my first Sony, I was an owner of a top-of-the line Dell Inspiron.","Stick to Dell or Apple.","My only wish is that it had more USB ports but I honestly think Dell is improving.","The HP out-performed the Dell on every level.","I don\u0027t see this effect on the Lenovo or Dell notebooks I use.Not surprisingly, the iBook screen was damaged (hairline \"cracks\" in the LCD screen) in less than 6 months.","I have had a Dell D600, 610, 620, 820 (currently), and an HP dv7-1245dx.First, the most obvious issue is weight.","*Although Amazon recommends reviews don\u0027t be too long, this is a major purchase with many things to consider and deserves an in depth review.I have owned 4 laptops, all Dell.","So I decided that the time was ripe to try a Mac again.At home, we now have a ThinkPad T42 running XP, a Toshiba Satellite running Vista, a Dell Desktop running XP and now, my MB063LL/B with OSX and XP installed.","(Wake up Dell)It\u0027s also the first time another new standard makes its debut: the 1.8-inch, Toshiba 20GB hard drive.","Again I only really have the standard Dell 610s and 410s to base this on but this HP touch pad has a texture to it I like much more.Secondly a laptop with these specs that includes 512 RAM for this price is impressive, but I think misleading: since the system uses shared video memory, and this is set to a minimum of 32 megs (set through the BIOS/CMOS), the most the actual OS will ever see is (512 - 32) 480 Megs.","However, if HP improved the sound output, this notebook could take the place of much of my home entertainment equipment... an interesting thought... and 2) get a bigger hard drive - this was my fault, not HP\u0027s.Nice system, great display, right amount of RAM and the right amount of processing power at an unbeatable price - even DELL could not match it (equivalent system, equivalent features - except for S-Video!) on their build your own web site.Buy it! Having owned a Powerbook G4 12\" laptop for the past 2 years, I found myself very hesitant to upgrade to the Macbook 13\" laptop.","A friend of mine had told me that Dell had the same policy so I was not surprised.","I would rate Toshibas at the top, Panasonic in the middle and Dell somewhere below freezing.","I don\u0027t play quake, but I read a review where someone said they got 196fps in Quake III.Some more positives:-I don\u0027t know what it is about the keyboard, but it\u0027s super easy to use and type fast on.-I consistently get a better wireless signal than people with Dells or Compaqs (the antennae are built into the frame of the screen.-Fingerprint reader and customizeable security subsystem that can be turned up so high that if you lose your password (or finger) you would have get part of the hardware replaced to make the laptop useable again.-A plethora of IBM utilities that let you customize the daylight out of your laptop.","I also prefer the security mechanisms and software packages over those I received on a Dell machine, the last time I tried Windows, more than 2 years ago.I don\u0027t like the keyboard, which is too sticky.","But as bad or worse then dell for parts.","Their support is almost non-existent when compared to a Dell or Gateway.","Please do not purchase a Dell computer.","I choose this Acer over a Dell 9300/9400 and I am very happy with my purchase.","It takes a little getting used to the different configuration from my dell laptop, but its very quick, and so far has been completely trouble free.","In that case, you have to resign yourself to returning the computer for repair -- and being without it for 2 to 3 weeks.All in all, then, after a year of owning the 3225, I feel as though I would probably have been better off paying the extra money for a Sony Vaio thin-and-light or maybe one of the sub-5-pound Dell laptops.However, I\u0027ll keep my eye on the Averatec unofficial forums to see how the newer thin-and-light models do.","Price point -- twice as much as a comparable Dell Latitude (which you can COMPLETELY customize) or a Fujitsu Lifebook (apart from the keyboard, the Lifebook series just plain rocks).4.","I wish Dell had a laptop with a quality screen like this.","I considered buying the Dell 8600 which is a great machine too but the Toshiba P15 offered the 2.8GHz Pentium IV processor with HT, a SD memory card slot, and an extra USB2 port which is always useful.There are only 3 issues with the P15 that if corrected would make of this a kick ass laptop: Replace XP Home with the Pro version, improve the sound system, and make it a little less bulky.Other than that, the Toshiba P15 is a great buy and will most likely satisfy the needs of demanding users like myself.","My old dell notebooks HD crashed after 1mo! and the lcd had to be replaced after a few months.","That is even comparing them to other terrible customer service such as Dell.","As far as personal experience, I\u0027ve seen way too many Dells fail first hand (including one of ours).","I immediately noticed the Toshiba Satellite has a solid feel and is comfortable to use, much more so than the Dell.","When it comes to games, quality headphones do the trick.The 80GB HD is a lot smaller than what I have in my Dell, but I\u0027ve invested in a Lacie D2 external drive which puts me at ease when storage is a concern.With Office for Mac, I can open, edit, and save any OfficeXP file I can find.","I am not the world\u0027s greatest computer geek by a long shot, but I do pretty well at work with HPs, Dells, etc.","If anyone can shed some light on this matter, please do.Overall, the computer is a fine product--I use it all the time now in place of a Dell Inspiron.","Prevoiusly I owned intel IBM and Dell laptops without complains also.I bought this about 6 months ago and could not be happier, not to mention the 50 bucks contribution to the Lance foundation and the livestrong graphics that people think are cool.Other Pro\u0027s: Great chasis and nice screen.","One minor issue: the laptop seems to get a little bit hot after a while, and it does not have those Laptop Legs attached to the bottom, they might be optional but would be very nice-to-have, (my old dell laptop used to have them, very convenient and kept the laptop from getting hot).Overall I am quite satisfied with the product and the seller\u0027s service, great laptop and great deal.","I barely used it the first year b/c I was still using my old Dell (the laptop this Toshiba was supposed to replace), and I had to send the Toshiba to the shop for hardrive repair just before the warranty expired.","Worse a dell power supply does not just stop working it just up and dies.","For the same price, I got a really terrific Dell whose quality is 100% better.","I have been very happy with my purchase.Like Sony\u0027s other consumer products, VAIO notebooks offer complete product refinement, with exceptional attention to detail and aesthetics that are superior to offerings from Dell, HP and Toshiba.","I don\u0027t see why they couldn\u0027t provide something like what HP has on their laptops for docking.- You pay significantly more for this laptop than you would for a similarly configured Windows laptop from HP or Dell (though they can\u0027t run OS X due to Apple licensing constraints)**.BOTTOM LINE:I\u0027d buy this laptop again only because I wanted both OS X (Mac) and Windows.","- the price ^^ this laptop is a excellet buy for it\u0027s price tag. similar slim note book for Sony or Fujisu cost almost double.After did some research, i\u0027vd decided to try this laptop.(i had Dell Inspiron before).","Take my advice and stay away from Dell products.","Try searching the internet for \"Dell Coupons,\" and although Dell doesn\u0027t usually offer them, you will often be redirected to a good limited-time offer at their official website.","HP owns Compaq so I trusted the company,HP is dell Enemy number 1.","Even the DVD on my old Dell proved to be a big headache; imagine how many more things can go wrong with a P25, with all it attempts to do.","good wireless (Intel wireless is the best compared to the broadcom wireless you find in some dell notebooks)5.","When you call to Dell for help, it\u0027s very dificult to find the right person, so at the end I prefered pay for a technician.","This HP performs much better than the Dell I had.","These laptops just arrived at school and boy are they fast.At home we have a dell xps and its much worse than the apple ibook g4 These laptops were never meant to run Vista, and it shows.There are numerous fora on the Internet that are filled with people who bought various Toshiba A135 models and then began tearing their hair out.","Had some trouble getting dual monitors with this resolution configured, but all did work when Dell monitor was configured as 2nd monitor not primary.","I mention this because if you have a problem with a computer from any other manufacturer, Dell HP etc. your only option is to call their indian support center, then mail it in and wait.","If you\u0027re worried about few software choices, I took the iBook to work in the middle of a Windows haven and it handled everything I threw at it, including some my work Dell couldn\u0027t handle.","I went home and configured a Dell D620 with the same specs and it came out to be almost five hundred cheaper.","My friends have had nightmares with their HPs, Gateways and Dells.","Sony and Dell are tools; all others I have used are flimsy toys.","Dell will load your laptop up with cheesy shareware software, where you have to buy it after 15 days.","I took the wraps off the 15\" Powerbook and set it next to my Dell Inspiron.","Dell is a nice computer if you plan to keep it in your home.","OVERVIEW: This is Toshiba\u0027s answer to Dell\u0027s E1705, and at about the same price range, offers many of the same utilities.","But the slight difference in the CPU is unlikely to change the overall impression too much.I have previously used Dell inspirons and latitudes, actually currently owning a latitude D620 with T7200 (2GHz core 2 duo) and 2GB of memory.","The total is still WAY cheaper than a Dell or other big name brand.","I liked the old Macs, but went to Windows when I entered \"corporate world\".I got this 12\" iBook because my Dell laptop SUCKED.","I hope it lasts as long as my A105 has (and that one is still going strong after 5 yrs and will become the \u0027desktop\u0027 that controls our network and printer once I trade in my dell) The $[...] rebate and the toshiba eztrade will bring the end cost down to just under $[...] for me.","All my other wireless connection works fine and the Dell Notebook works fine.","This notebook feels very robust, unlike some Dell notebooks that I have used.","The top of the line Tosh Tecra and Dell latitude I owned failed in the first six months.","Consider that if you ever need to pay someone like me to reinstall the O/S, the time that Acer\u0027s careless approach to providing drivers consumes will add $100 to your TCO, compared with a comparable Thinkpad or Dell system.","Also, the adapter is a proprietary form factor--a standard adapter cannot substitute for this one normally.Summary: The Dell Latitude CPX series is still a great and solid computer, but the technology is at best, vintage, for the new users that are expecting computers to do more of what is now expected.","This computer is a million times more fun than our Dell desktop and my dads HP laptop.","I use a Dell PC at work, and I can\u0027t wait to get home to my Macintosh.","I just received my 17\" Powerbook and it was PERFECT out of the box!I have owned IBM/Sony/Dell and never have I just: 1)Open Box 2)Plug in 3)Turn on 4)Answer a few network questions 5)On-Line!! It launched into a quick software update and not one freeze, error message or hours on hold with tech support (somewhere in India-in the case of Dell) What a great design!What I can add to Stephen\u0027s review is this, consider the Apple Care protection plan.","Darn!!So how does the Toshiba compare to my Dell and my HP? I just might now part with my Dell.","Word documents, Excel documents, and power point presentations can all move back and forth between the mac and the dell without problems.","My Dell is still somehow faster and it\u0027s running on Windows XP with a 1.7 Ghz processor.Also, if you need to use other software products like Excel, Windows Media (to download and play videos), or Shockwave from Macromedia...good luck to you.","And then they have 10 business days to repair the useless piece of junk that your $1300 just turned into.I had many IBMs and DELLs, for periods of couple of years long.","I used many laptops including sony, dell etc.","Let\u0027s put it this way: I won\u0027t touch a Dell in a lifetime.","It\u0027s a good deal, again, if you need business performance, otherwise....Go for a Dell (www.dell.com) or an IBM.You\u0027ll have to wait a week or two for the dell or IBM, but it\u0027s worth it.","Decide for yourself if it is worth the price, but if you don\u0027t need the latest processor and you want something reliable, this one can\u0027t be beat within Dell\u0027s stable.","Oh, did I mention that I got 2 extra years of customer support and all-inclusive express repairs included in the price? If you need to know, I ordered it from HP but similar deals can be had from Dell and others.I am not here to promote any other notebook, but if you really want bang for your buck do your research and don\u0027t buy for looks, see what you can get for your hard-earned money from a PC company.","It steps the massive 3.06GHz down to 1.8GHz and the power usage slows but steps up as needed when a program starts proccessing over some asoteric percentage.I replaced my 2.4 GHz Dell Desktop and this d*** thing runs circles around it.Great for desktop replacement and playing movies.","Having spent nearly $2700 on the Dell, I can now say that because of my experience with this notebook, I am a Thinkpad convert.","But when I compared to a comparable Dell 17-inch notebook (very nice, I must add), and added hardware and software features, resale value, plus considering ease of use and increased productivity, the $2700 in price is a bargain.","It outperforms my friend\u0027s Dell Inspiron 1.6GHz Pentium 4 (same RAM) everytime we run benchmarking software on both computers (and he paid $2300 for his Dell!).","I am now looking for a used, faster, Dell D610 only because my Outlook file has grown so large (400mb) and my HD is now about 90% full, it takes longer and longer to boot up.","I needed a new notebook after my 3-year old Dell Inspiron 1100 stopped properly charging the battery.","Since 2000, when I purchased my first Toshiba, which still runs, I went through two Panasonics (over $2000 each), two Dells and I feel that this one is simply the best performer and the best value for the money.","Best one by far.This computer is incredible, and the new intel version of Final Cut Studio flies! Time to ditch your desktop! my friend has a dell and i have this.","I will care of the laptop very well for many years to come and keep it fully update with Windows XPUpdate on my Dell Inspiron 9100 Laptop.","I\u0027m sure this is now not the case as dell is great for dealing out discounts and coupons, but I\u0027ve still never looked back and the macbook still has a longer battery life compared to the awkwardly shaped 9cell from dell.I\u0027m still going to use my PC desktop for my hardcore gaming and photoshopping, but for everything else there\u0027s my MacBook.","Also, the plastic case is solid, much more so than some of the flimsy stuff used on some Dell notebooks.Probably I could have used another 200-400 pixels in the vertical display dimension, but that would have increased the cost.","You can get a dell, HP, or sony vaio for far cheaper but with the same specs.Better yet, get yourself a laptop that has 2GB of memory (this model has 1, and adding another GB costs even more) so that you can run any operating system you choose smoothly and beautifully.Anyways, just keep in mind three things before you buy this:1 Bad user interface is very confusing and very impractical, especially for those who have grown up using windows (basically everybody)2 Extremely overpriced - can get a much better laptop for same money3 Not compatible with many of your favorite games and other software applications I actually do not own this but my friend bought one a month ago.","When the Sony was down I bought a Dell 1425 which is very good also.","Max Battery usually leaves the computer running at about 400 mhz, but that\u0027s been more than enough for my typical web browsing.My sister has a Dell and for the price, I don\u0027t think I ended up too badly, it feels like the Averatec is very solidly built, but maybe because it\u0027s only a month old.The wireless works very well also, my friend has a Dell D400, very nice and small, but more expensive.","Nice touches include a remote that tucks into the pc slot, 10 keypad, gorgeous 17\" screen and solid build quality(compared to Dells).","Setting it up is a bit long, but once it works, it takes literally seconds to set up pages to work with it.People seem to complain that it is not like their IBM Thinkpad or Dell, which I agree with SINCE IT IS NOT EITHER!! Bottom line, some people like certain brands.","It has a bigger screen than a VAIO and works better than a Dell.","My current laptop is a Dell Inspiron 8600 with the then revolutionary Pentium M processor.","the money i have spent , i would have got 4 more durable and better performance laptops like dell 700m.Stay away from this I write just to state this is my third vaio laptop over the last 8 years.","After 3 weeks of waiting for the Dell to be shipped and still told it was on backorder; I started to research Toshiba and HP- wanted a 17\" screen.","Dell Latitude D620-1.66 Laptop Wireless Computer (Refurbished)I got this computer from Tampa Laptops thru Amazon.Well dont let the stars fool you after a month the computer quit working and i talked to Tampa Laptops and we had to send it back another $50.down the drain well another month and it is not working and they want even talk to me on the phone after i told them who i was i got the i will call you back and they never did!!! So FYI Do not buy a computer from them and buy the way i did not know about Amazon A-Z where you could file a claim untill now and that is what i found out A-Z out of luck!!!!! Save your money and buy one from Walmart!! You will be better off!!! And by the way i tried to take back the feedback that i gave them after ten days and Amazon want let me do that so i am doing this review to help someone!!!! Dells in general are really pretty good computers but from personal experience I would not give you 15 cents on a good day for what Dell call\u0027s a power supply.","Only a few manufacturers offer XP as an os change, ex Dell.","None of these items would need to be replaced if the LCD was replaced at the Dell Depot like it should have been and if it did not get damaged at the Dell Depot.All Dell is doing is stating that they will do something in the future which should have already been done.","I have two Dell desktops, and I was looking for something ultra-portable.","Dell and others has increased the warranty periods of laptops using these cards, HP has done similar, with the 9000 series notebooks, but excluded this and other affected systems.","I previously owned a Dell Desktop, which was trash in comparison.","I bought this amazing little machine to replace an aging Dell P3 (L400) machine w/256 Megs running XP.","I\u0027ve had HP Compaq and Dell laptops.","Disappointing because I use that color throughout my website, often coordinating the print with particular photographs.Color really matters to me but I am loath to change it on my site as all the Gateways, Toshibas, Dell and Macs I have checked out show the correct hues.For the price and all the features, this is a fine laptop.","Ordered another from Dell just now for $250.Oh, well .","Gateway may seem inexpensive, but don\u0027t expect the warranty to cover ANYTHING! stick to Dell, they listen to the problem before making a decision.","If you are undecided between this laptop and PC\u0027s like the Vaio and Dell series, I recommend go for this one.","I have been shoping around for the perfect notebook to replace my old-and-bulky Dell Inspiron in the recent months, and found this Akoya LS the one fits my needs exactly:1.","The dvd drive is a excellent feature and more of a added bonus but the cd burner is an awsome little burner and usful for on the spot recording (I\u0027m a broadcast student).The bundle software I am never a big fan of but it does include some very handy software such as money 2003,Intervideo 2004 and Works those are just a few but the ones I use the most.The techincal support is the best support team out there they will speak english to you instead of computer lingo and will accaully be nice when the custumer is getting upset.I have use Sony\u0027s tech support on and off for the last three years and they truely know how to treat their custumers with kindness.I would say comparing to the computers I have used in my life (Hewitt Packard,Dell and Gateway) you are getting more for the money when you purchase a Sony Vaio and you are buying quality.","I bought my GRX520 in 2002 as a replacement for a Dell Inspiron 4000.","A Dell, HP, Compaq, or a Sony would better fit your needs.","As far as speed is concerned, it is comparable to my Dell P4 2.8 ghz desktop.","Bought the Averatec AV3225HS in November 2004*love the slim \u0026 light profile*AMD processor is a better product than the Intel chips, but the average user cannot tell, but will feel good about not caving into the Intel monopoly (my desktop PC is also an AMD processor :) )*DC adapter is designed well and not bulky and does not take up space on your wall outlet*came with XP software and will automatically update*have installed several home-user software (MS Office, Quicken, etc) without issues*battery life is about 3hrs, about 2 with wireless modem on all the time*Wireless modem works very well, as does the builtin ethernet connection*dvd player/cd burner works well.*if you\u0027re looking for a great laptop that works straight out of the box..this is it!!!! I recommend this brand over Dell\u0027s and HPs for the price and form factor Bought the computer on my trip to Honolulu Hawaii on Oct. 21.","I used to have a dell, and it sounded like it was going to blast off into space all the time.3.","Wireless: Dell Wireless 1470 Internal Wireless (802.11a/b/g, 54 mbps), bluetooth technology7.","It is a millon times better than a Dell or any other windows computer.","I would rather buy a Dell or Toshiba but never again another Sony Laptop.","One hour seems to ne the limit, grossly short compared to my Dell Inspiron.","I looked at the Dell, great price but I didn\u0027t like it\u0027s looks.","At 7.5lbs, the Dell was really a bear to carry around.","Better than my Dell that cost twice as much when you add up everything that came with it.","The battery indicator they add is much better than the standard XP one.Overall I love this laptop compared to the Dell, HP Sony, Toshiba and WinBook laptops I have seen and used.Hopefully this research will help make your decision easier.","To begin with, the specified dell system doesn\u0027t come pre-installed with a wireless card like the ibook does.","They greatly reduced the quality once they realized they were going to last forever, Dell sort of did the same thing.","I\u0027ve like sony for a while, whether with cameras or computers and that\u0027s why I went for this (I think they are very user friendly) however there is a similar DELL one for about 400$ less and I would think your better off checking that one out too before going ahead and getting this another reason I also went for this one was that you can operate the DVD player without having to boot up the whole system which I think is really practical, esp when on long trips and wanting to watch something without having to waste all the battery.","I have a Dell m1710 with a 512mb 7900GTX and I love it, but this thing is small enough to take to work each day and play on breaks and the battery life is good enough to last all day.","I\u0027ve used Dell,HP,Gateway,Compaq,Sony and pretty much every kind there is, but I\u0027ve always had a love for the ThinkPad.","That never happened when I had a Dell!I bought the external DVD drive and used it to load some software.","Oh yeah and these CDs worked fine in my work comp (DELL).","Design - It\u0027s Apple and well... the design it great... pretty thin compared to my old notebook (17\" Dell inspiron 9300 which was a big ugly machine)2.","Dell can\u0027t beat it for quality and speed of components at this price point.","My other laptop is a Dell, it has never had any a problem with the wireless but this one I have to turn it off and hope it will find the wireless connection.If it were my router I would have troubles with my dell laptop, but it had never happened.","(For serious portable gamers, try a Dell 8100 with a 16 or better yet a 32 MB NVidea Graphics card) If you want a nice reliable, speedy, desktop replacement, then this is the computer for you.","$880 bucks for 1 year extended warranty...????? And they wonder why they are losing marketshare to Dell (hate Dell product, but their Customer Service is the aces) - So maybe CPQ/HP will wake up some day and take notice of those kicking their butts before they file BK or get bought up by IBM or Dell...","But just to compare:My Dell laptop has a 7200rpm HDD and it gets 4.4My Dell desktop (brand new) has a 7200 rpm HDD and it gets 5.3So, significantly faster data transfer than the laptop (and, btw, most laptops come with 4200rpm drives which would be even slower) but about the same as a desktop.","At 6lbs this is 1/3 less heavy than my Dell inspiron 4000.","It\u0027s not really fast, but it integrates nicely into the laptop, and is decidedly much, much cooler than those flimsy contraptions that I see sliding out of so many other laptops (my Dell included).","This is a 15\" model, with the UXGA(1600x1200) Flexview display.To begin, I was in dire need of a newer, more portable notebook as I have just started school and my Dell XPS M1730 was far too large and had too little battery life to really cut it.","Now when I use my Dell I am so annoyed by how slow it is since I\u0027m use to using this machine.","The AC adapter from Dell uses a keyed beveled connector that looks engineered to reduce such AC plug issues that plague all laptops.","I do not have any scratches, unlike many of my friends with Dells.","The build quality is better than Dell\u0027s.","It out-performs most of the $4000 Dell and AlienWare notebooks without even heating up.","I have seen Dell laptops with similar RAM work much fater.","The computer has not been troublesome until recently, although I found myself wondering why a $1300 (plus plus plus) Macbook was any better than the $500 Dell I use at work.","Quick shipping, got a crummy DELL case for the laptop, pictures are not the same as posted.","All I have done is six years is to replace a power supply, one battery, and repaired an F5 key.I like Dell products.","I had a chance to take a good look at Dell laptops that were recently purchased at my work and was not very impressed with the solidity of the small, lightweight laptops.","The original Sharp LCD panel did not experience any of these issues.I contacted Dell Techical Support via chat once again.","Pricewise, it is almost like I purchased a $1000 keyboard though! Dell\u0027s support has been very good.","I\u0027ve had Dell, Tandy, and Compaq laptops in the past.","I bought the Dell Computer for a gift, as far as I know it is working fine, just needs a new battery.","buy 2 gigabytes of ram on the web for about $500 instead of upgrading through IBM, get the IBM a/b/g wireless and you will enjoy the best computing I have ever seen -- other computers I use are dell 600m and desktops, this is fast and with best keyboard and great screenJeff Buyer beware! While it may work fine at first, it will break in no time! I purchased this laptop less than a year ago, and although I was extremely careful and gentle with it, it is completely useless right now.","Assuming you don\u0027t have the wireless issues I did and dell isn\u0027t running any really good deals on the 700m the averatec is a good buy for a cheap portable machine.","I will be returning mine back to Amazon and stick with Dell.","I did receive my refund, thanks to Amazon, I am out the cost of the Dell service call and expense to ship and insure the defective unit, but that is a small price to pay to break all ties with a seller like this one.","Or a Dell.","I was shocked to read reviews about how hot it gets and the noise, clearly those people have never owned a Dell.","With similar specs, the Dell is 300 dollars cheaper.","Beats the important (at the time Dell) and a custom made thing that fried.","Something had happened while the computer was at the Dell Depot which caused the BIOS to not recognize that a hard drive was installed.","If I could give Dell power supplies a negative number I would.","I just purchased this machine to replace my desktop after looking primarily at the Dell 8600, the 15\u0026quot; Power Book and the HP ZV5160 and am having no second thoughts.","I speced out a nice Dell laptop for work, my boss got me this cheaply built POS from Costco instead, saving a whopping $100 over my well decked out Dell.The touch screen is pretty much useless.","Although it benefits from a far larger screen than my old Dell, the Laptop is roughly 5 lbs lighter and it\u0027s power supply is less than half the weight.","And $750+ for a laptop repair??! You can get a fully loaded brand new HP or Dell, with much better and newer specs for LESS than their repair price and even a T61 Thinkpad for slightly more (if you shop smart)!!Sony \"robs\" you both when and after you buy.Generally speaking, Sony electronics have bloated prices which they don\u0027t warrant.","Of course all laptops have bad built-in speakers, but my friend\u0027s Dell XPS completly blows these out of the water.","Traded in my Dell for this HP and was totally blown away with it! I\u0027ve always had Pentium machines....NO MORE! AMD is the superior performer, hands down, faster, lighter, less power consumption, cooler...","This is a fantastic notebook! The 15\" display is beautiful, the ATI Radeon 9000 allows you to play the latest games, and the build quality is excellent (these Powerbooks are made by the same company that makes high end Dell laptops).","Dell was reputed to have outstanding service, so I paid about $300 just for an extra long extended warranty.","Sony obviously has decided at an institutional level that customer service is important (at least in their VAIO computer department), and it really shows.In summary, though the Dell XPS 1330 has some advantages, I chose the Sony VAIO VGN-SZ450 for the fantastic tried and true sleek design and because of Sony\u0027s outstanding customer service.","This means a very low likelihood of receiving a screen with dead pixels (a problem I consistently have with Dell).I was a bit confused with all of Sony\u0027s model #s for the R505 SuperSlim Pro series, but they are all basically the same with slightly different specs.I will tell you the benefits of buying a Sony vs the cons.Pros1) Sony has the best LCD screens hands down.","I am on my third laptop, where the first two were Dell machines.","You may have to find some more specialized programs for Excel and Powerpoint files, Graphics editing, etc...-ummm.....-The mouse has just one button-umm.....-Mac OSX takes a little getting used to, but then you\u0027ll figure it out after a day or twoYou will be sorry if you choose to buy a Wintel (Dell, Compaq, HP, Gateway, Sony, etc...)notebook.","However, they are quite pricey at nearly 2000 dollars (You can also get a Dell Inspiron 5100 with similar specs for around 1300 - 1500).","(My VAIO has the 2 GHZ T7200, while the Dell 2 GHZ processor is the T7300).","I just got this computer 6 months ago and Sony said that they would not cover it.There is a good chance that it will be more cost effective for me to buy a Dell than to have Sony fix this problem.","I have and will continue to lose a great amount of productivity due to this problem.I contacted Dell Technical Support via phone and explained to them what has happened.","At work and at home, I owned: Dell Inspiron, Thinkpad, Dell/HP Desktops, running Windows 98/2000/XP.","Got to laugh at Dell (they SUCK!, Service is atrocious/outrageous responses..please don\u0027t purchase the \"extended warranty\" from them...they will not honor it, DELL products are middle of the road, although cheap...and that sums up what you get....cheap).","Also I tinkered with Sun workstations running UNIX (I\u0027m an EE guy and have a respect for UNIX).After 12 years of Microsoft (and blue screens), I made a bold switch to Apple Powerbook 15\u0026quot; with 1.5GHz/512RAM/80Gb, and I\u0027m so happy with this system that even 5 stars are not high enough.- The sleek aluminum chassis and the wide screen generate Wow! effect.- This 15\u0026quot; machine is lighter than my old Dell laptop.- It\u0027s very quiet during operation, but the bottom side may occasionally become hot.- The keyboard has a good depth and touch, and the backlit keyboard is simply cool.- Using the built-in microphone, you can play the bundled 3-D chess game via OS X\u0027s voice-recognition.","Although my school endorses Macs and Dells, I decided on an HP.","I\u0027ve since reformatted and installed xp (a difficult process since dell does not support xp drivers for this machine, but if you\u0027re savvy you can find through forums) with xp it runs better but Still would not recommend.","Slow doesn\u0027t begin to describe it.I have a Dell 610 with identical Centrino and it is spectacularly fast.","I would never purchase another product by Dell.","The Dell Latitude D600 shipped by Laptop Online arrived in four days in good condition.","Overall I have to give this package a 3.3 out of 5 for the following reasons: Since this is my first Toshiba laptop (the last one was a Dell) I am very disappointed about the single sized teeny tiny right-hand shift key; I am continually hitting the up arrow instead after having used keyboards with the expected 2 1/4-sized right-hand shift key for the past 20+ years.","My advice? Shell out a couple extra hundred for a Dell.","I researched this unit and compared to other Toshiba, Dell and ThinkPad before the purchase, and after a month feel even more confident about the decision.Some Cons\u0026gt; Additional battery is overpriced.","Would recommend T23 - and any other ThinkPad laptop in general - over anything HP/Compaq or Dell can offer! I was very disappointed when I got my VAIO home and found out how \"S-L-O-W\" it was!! sometimes the seasons changed before it would shut down, I even turned it off and removed the batteries just to get it to shut down.","While the small size and sharp screen are great, I think I would have been much better off buying an Apple or a Dell, two brands I\u0027ve always had great luck with.","I find the lid especially distasteful, the texture is of that of rough sandpaper and really appears to be a stalk contrast to the sleek metal interior, I don\u0027t know why but Sony did not make any locking hinge for this laptop, although the lid snaps down when you close the laptop, it doesn\u0027t feel secure at all.Another thing that bugs me is that it has an external antenna on the right side, its about 3\", and it just kinda hangs off the side, I know that the VAIO TX series has the same antenna which is for the GPRS internet fron Cingular, (which the SZ also has on the more expensive models), but the SZ220 doesn\u0027t have the GPRS, so why in the world is the antenna still out? I could only think this is for the wireless LAN, but almost every other laptop manages to have an internal antenna and I don\u0027t see the difference in range of this external antenna either.The power adapter is the thing that gets me, this laptop uses an 85W AC adapter, so it is huge...this is bigger than the Dell 65W adapter and it weighs exactly 1 pound! I find it hilarious that this little laptop has such a big adapter.","I contacted Dell Technical Support via chat again.","2nd best screen I\u0027ve seen (besides Dell 700m).* Large Keyboard - For an ultraportable, all keys are full-sized.","The Dell D600 is an older piece of technology,but it works very well.","The only downside is that it is also literally a hot laptop, but not more than my Windows-based laptop from Dell.","My display,hard drive, and mother board have been replaced on site with next day business protection from DELL.","Although both the OS and the laptop itself are excellent products, I can\u0027t help but glance from time to time at my Dell Inspiron for answers whenever I get stuck in a rut.","Our Dell laptop was getting outdated and we had to buy a new machine.","So if you do lots of typing, it could be annoying.I used more than 10 laptops, including 2 IBM, 3 DELL, 2 Toshiba, 1 Sony, 1 Gateway, 1 everex(?), etc.","Reviewer: Tariq Al-Hassomi \"TOA\" (Kingdom of Bahrain, Manama) - See all my reviewsAlways Tablet PC\u0027s were expensive, i always wanted to own one, when the prices began from $1,500 - 2,500 in the old days, till my eyes catched this tablet, coming to the specs and the user reviews i would add also.1) Toshiba a very long life brand reputation in electronics specially labtops.2) The price is so economic, with greats hardware specs.3) The functions of the tables are amazing, very elegant and very compact, a tablet with all needs, its a real smart results made.4) The software included, as we know toshiba never leavs anything needed behind, all apps. included and other software can be found.I also upgraded it the memory DDR from 512MB to 1GB which made speed fly high, i recommend not holding some bucks for upgrading to 1GB for smoothness performance.Owning this tablet for who needs it is a good choice, its doing the job with a good price, i cant sleep without it at night.;)TOA Run, my friends, run from Dell\u0027s line of laptop computers.","that said, my dell m1330 and my macbook pro are more indispensable and \"important\" to me.","HP laptop\u0027s design is not as good as Sony\u0027s, but it much better than Dell, also Dell laptop with same specification at least costs $1600 even with promotion.I have intensively used this laptop at work and at home for a few day ( over 10 hours per day ).","This notebook easily surpass the Dell and Compaq when it comes to same specs.","As the only other candidate that still would stand a chance agianst the 12\" PB specs was a slightly more expensive and physically larger Dell that I had never seen apart from a wonkey picture on thier website.","We like the idea of everything being integrated, but the integration is an unachieved ideal, a fantasy.If I had to do it again, I\u0027d get the exchange computer Dell cheerfully offered when the first malfunctioned.","I also wanted to keep the price under $1000 which with the rebate I got it was right at about $1000.I very glad I didn\u0027t get a cheap Dell system.","4 friends bought notebooks at the same time Dell, Sony, (2)Toshibas all of theirs had P4 chips, and this HP simply outclasses them- 3 my friends admitit! And they paid $500-$900 more! Their notebooks weigh a full pound more, they are thicker, and the P4\u0027s are much louder requiring a loud cooling fan.The S video, Firewire, serial ports are awesome features.","It is based out of California so, unlike Dell, you can talk to someone without an accent and they can understand you perfectly.","I have an old Dell laptop with the same style mouse and it never does that.Otherwise I like it so far, but a very basic thing like that gets annoying very quicly, so if you get one...check out that issue.","The trackpad is better than my Dell\u0027s as well (I had to turn off \"tapping\" on my Dell b/c it would pick up my hand when I was typing.","I would recommend Dell or HP.","I use a Dell laptop as well, and the Lenovo is simply not as zippy.","Get headphones or some external speakers.SCREENIn terms of clarity I only have my old Dell 700M to compare it to and the 700M definitely has a clearer and more vibrant screen.","(It just doesn\u0027t sweep the house or do the dishes but alas a woman can\u0027t have everything all of the time)!In the last month, the Dell Latitude has been great.","I have always used IBM or Dell but IBM has been Jacking up prices and Dell\u0027s Quality has slipped.","Tons of Marketing (it\u0027s a dell DUDE) and very bad product.","Until Dell gets the message that a cheap power supply makes even the nicest computer just another paperweight I\u0027d avoid Dell unless you know how to swap power a power supply.Cheap as Dell power supplies are I would buy more than a few Dell Power supplies to keep laying around as spares since the average Dell power supply dies faster than 15 cent goldfish left in a hot car on a summer day.","Blows any HP or DELL laptop out of the water, without a doubt! Best lap top I have every had and the price is about $500 cheaper than comparable lap tops.","Seriously buy the toshiba or even the DELL, dont waste your hard earned on this dud.Grant Hi, I got this for Valentine\u0027s Day and the computer is awesome.","I purchased a dell computer on August 5th and it came in on August 11th.","Mine weighs a lot less, looks slicker and like I said, Vista is cool.Not to say things can\u0027t or won\u0027t crop up...Time will tell but that\u0027s how it is with ANY brand I have found...I have owned laptops from Dell, to Gateway to Toshiba and now HP.","Pro: the burning air from the laptop is good for warming hands in cold winter.Con:dark screenSince I bought this laptop, I swear I will never buy any product of Dell.","A comparable notebook from Dell -- running XP -- was quoted to me at $1200.","I still have a Dell that I bought 5 years ago, and whenever anything goes wrong they will even come to your house to fix it.","While Dell is not serious competition, Sony VAIO is probably the closest rival.","Not a single problem.If people this this is a less than serious machine because it is a Sony (and not a Dell, HP or other \u0027computer\u0027 brand), they\u0027re wrong.","Regardless, I\u0027m back to Dell (my 5th) and most likely will never stray again.","(I had ZERO problems with my last laptop, a dell, in 3 years of heavy use.)","Unfortunately I bought two Toshibas at the same time, this one and another higher end model, which is also now just sitting there in the corner since it also barely works I have owned a Dell Latitude, an IBM Thinkpad and a Toshiba Satellite and this one beats all of them to dust.The display is awesome and the PIII rocks at 1.13 Gz.","I like my Dell fine.","They\u0027re almost as good as (business) Dell support, and from me, that\u0027s quite a compliment because I give Dell business support a \"10.\"I still wouldn\u0027t spend more than $1,100 for this much as I like it.","I currently have a Dell at home and at work.","Quality of Dell computer systems have been noted by many companies that supply systems for employees.","This computer is just like the Dell Inspiron and also at a great price.","great sleep feature!would I buy another one, osX is great, I will buy another one if the price stay at the same level, but with 1.5ghz+ G4/512M! for this price, unless u have to have a Mac, YOu can do much much better with a window machine!Just a honest option from a window/Mac user! First let me say that I am sure this refurbished pc from dell would have been fine if it had arrived intact with nothing missing.","Ever! But now you have vista to take it\u0027s place.So I decided to go ahead after years of thinking and I bought this gateway and it is by far the best looking and the best working one I have seen today.I work on computers and I would normally by a dell are a IBM around 5 years of age because they last forever.They new model computers I don\u0027t care what model they are will last you for a year tops if you use them enough.As you can see this laptop is still around and still working! Get it ! How many can say that when they go to besy buy and buy a laptop new! How many times did you go back and if your warranty was up you were screwed! Its a great laptop with a full keyboard I mean a full keyboard like you have on a desktop.Not squeezed together like the newer model laptops! All kind of buttons for your every need.I give this laptop rave reviews and its still going and count the years when it first came out and then count the years of the newer model laptop you have and does it still work.For this laptop to still work after 8 years I am please with no problems so how about that! Cant say that for many laptops now a days.You get 1 year with all that junk in it and it will last 1 year.Now I ask you whats better a laptop working for a long time are a suped up one that last a year.I got my money worth plus and this laptop still works without a hitch.Upgraded to 2gb of memory and 100gb hardrive.And now I can add up to 500 gigs with the new IDE PATA DRIVES.Man I have no complaints take it from me it will last you for ever! And I can put any operating system on it including Windows 7.","I love my reconditioned Dell Latitude and such a bargain.","I am SOOO disappointed in this purchase I will be selling it and getting a Dell.","Go price a Dell or Sony with all of these same features and come back to me.*things to look out for: 1.)","It is packed inside a white cloth slipcover so I kept that rather than throwing it away to protect it when inside a case.PROS -I LOVE the fingerprint reader since you can \"register\" all the internet places you go to and log on with just a fingerprint swipe!For a desktop replacement the battery life is good (comparing it to the battery life of my old Dell 9100).","Buy a Dell, a Sony Vaio, an Apple.... or buy a machine put together (out of spare parts) by a pimply high school kid, but DON\u0027T..","The battery has a better life than the Dell that I previously owned.","Ran bout $700 cheaper than Dell\u0027s XPS Notebook.","Even the low-end ibook has a faster processor (the 12-inch with 1.33 ghz) Also, the price difference is mainly due to shipping, which dell offers for free on top of the 34% discount that you get on the laptop.Another thing about the dell 600M is that you have to add-on all of the software, security and wireless capabilities.Looking at the software, you have to purchase Microsoft office in order to attain the same degree of productivity that you can get with ilife on the ibook.","However as a former employee of Dell I can tell you that most computer companies have lousy technical support.","I never tried it with XP, because Dell did not include the XP CD with my purchase.","My last computer was a Dell desktop, and though I never had problems with Dell, Sony is simply on a higher level of service.","This supposedly top-of-the-line desktop replacement, for nearly twice the price of a Dell or a Fujitsu Lifebook, has plenty of gripes and very little to distinguish it from competition:1.","Before this one I had a Dell Inspiron 8200 (big and heavy), and after using the Vaio T I will definetely never go back to a big laptop or buy from Dell, and I will surely buy from Sony again.","I have owned 2 Dell\u0027s, 1 IBM, 1 Accer, 1 iBookG4, 2 Sony\u0027s and both Sony\u0027s have been a nightmare."],"aspect":"company","keyword":"Dell"}]
