the ASUS driver page of their website to get my computer set up.ASUS did have an automated feature that was supposed to do this, but either I got impatient or the automatic ASUS update feature crashed, so I did the process manually.This is something that is really not that hard to do, but what I am saying is that when you get the computer you have to install some software and reboot the computer several times before the computer moves from \"factory condition\" to being ready to use for daily tasks.I can only surmise that ASUS is able to reduce the price of this laptop because they don't manually do all this software installation and rebooting processes themselves before shipping you the machine.But really.Think about it.Spending 1 hour installing software and rebooting the machine a couple times to save about $1000 USD is really NOT a big deal.Unless you think your time is worth more than $1000/hour :)And hey I can simplify this process for you if you get this product.Here is the ASUS driver page:[...]This is the only site I had to go in order to get my machine up and running.I installed the RealTek audio driver and the NVIDIA video drivers manually after using the asus auto-update program to update the rest of the system.~~~Extra Software?There really wasn't much extra software on this computer that I had to delete.There were some simple video games for kids that I deleted, but most of the included software was from ASUS.I don't recommend you delete the ASUS software! It is all very useful.Pay special attention to the \"SmartLogon Manager\"This is NOT bloat-ware / useless software.This is the program that you run to enable your computer to recognize your face using the built in video camera so you can login without touching the keyboard (if you set up your computer with a password the first time you run it).~~~SummaryI am writing this review for YOU, because I want you to know that this laptop really IS the awesome deal that it appears to be.Hardware Quality:The graphics card, 750 GB hard drive, 8 GB of memory, quad core 7i pentium chip set and everything else really are absolutely awesome.Keyboard/Touchpad:People complaining about the keyboard not working properly are just being silly, the touch pad is bigger than most so your thumb can tend to brush against it and then your cursor moves across half the screen while you are typing, but that is a matter of the PHYSICAL positioning of your thumb and has nothing to do with software or hardware, it is just about getting used to the slightly larger touch pad, which you can always turn off while typing for a while.I myself just use an external mouse and keyboard the vast majority of the time since this is faster than using a touchpad.The back-lighting of the keyboard is wonderful and yes it can shine in your eyes at certain angles, but you can TURN IT OFF using function commands on the laptop keyboard.So all common complaints about this keyboard are baseless and silly, and easily adjusted.All the amazing BENEFITS of this computer have been explained thoroughly by other reviewers and by the computer specs themselves.And it is all TRUE.My computer has worked perfectly for the approximately 3 weeks that I have owned it, my laptop has never once done anything strange.LCD / Screen:The LCD of the computer has been perfectly happy, no problems here (some people reported problems in this regard, especially with a different laptop in the same G73 series.", "After owning the laptop for all this time and taking VERY good care of the hardware & system, the hard drive is failing for no reason."], "keyword": "hard drive", "aspect": "hard_disc"}, {"responses": ["Im not much of a thechy freak, so i really dont mind it not having the best processor, and for the 320 gb of memory isnt bad either, i have a hard drive to use.", "Plenty of memory & RAM, and a fast processor.", "PROS:-Great compact size-Great screen resolution-3 USBs-Clean casing-Large hard drive for a small laptop-Dual layer DVD burner-Dual core processor-1GB of RAM-Very competitely priced-4-in-1 memory card reader and ExpressCard slotCONS:-ATROCIOUS BATTERY!!!! - I got 113 minutes on my battery drain, 126 minutes on standard, and a measely 140 minute maximum battery.", "(I was watching the movies fed off of a memory stick, so there was no external DVD or hard disk eating up power.)Wireless card:I was a little worried about problems with the wireless card before I made my purchase, as I found an unsettling large amount of complaints online about Samsung's wireless card.", "This is a great computer!
